PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Winter Park, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1960 Code, as supplemented through November 26, 1991, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1960 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix.

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Supervising Editor, and Jody Wilson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. C. Brent McCaghren, City Attorney, and Ms. Joyce M. Swain, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(e)  The willful refusal to sign or accept a citation issued by a code enforcement officer or refusal to provide the information required by section 1-25 shall be a violation of this article and shall be prosecuted as a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in F.S. § 775.082 or F.S. § 775.083, or successor provisions.

DIVISION 2. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 2-48. - General rules applicable to subsidiary boards of the City of Winter Park. 
(a)  Date of appointment of members. With the exception of the civil service board, the members of all boards of the city shall be appointed by the mayor, subject to the approval of the city commission, at the first commission meeting in May of each year or as soon thereafter as possible and such members shall be seated at the first meeting following May 31. The members of the civil service board shall be appointed in December and be seated effective the third Tuesday in January. 
(b)  Removal of members. Members of city boards shall serve at the will of the city commission and shall be subject to removal at any time, with or without cause, by a majority vote of the city commission. This provision is intended to be supplemental to, and not in conflict with, the provisions of F.S. § 112.501 which concerns the procedure for removal or suspension of a member of a municipal board for cause. In instances when a member is removed for cause, the procedures in F.S. § 112.501 shall apply. 
(c)  Resignations. Members of all boards shall be entitled to resign at any time by delivery of written notice thereof to the city commission. 
(d)  Quorum. A quorum shall be a majority of the total board membership physically in attendance at a meeting. 
(e)  Applicability of rules of ethics. No member shall take any action or vote if such vote or action is prohibited by a standard of conduct or voting conflict of interest as defined or prohibited in the code of ethics for public officers and employees stated in F.S. ch. 112 or if such action or vote is in violation of the Code of the City of Winter Park. 
(f)  Vacancies. The mayor, subject to approval of the city commission, shall promptly fill all vacancies, including alternate members, occurring on city boards. A vacancy shall be filled for the unexpired term of the member whose term becomes vacant. 
(g)  Alternate members. An alternate member may always participate in board discussions subject to the rules adopted by each board for the conduct of meetings and member discussion at meetings. Unless a member of the board is absent, an alternate member may not make motions or cast a vote at a meeting. However, if a member of the board is absent, then at such meeting where the member is absent, an alternate may make motions and cast a vote in the stead of the absent member. In the event a regular member of a board is removed from office or vacates his or her office prior to the end of the appointed term, the alternate of said board, will automatically advance to the vacated position for the remainder of the regular term without additional action of the city commission. If there is no alternate, the mayor shall appoint subject to commission approval. 
(h)  Exception to automatic advancement. If a vacancy occurs in a board position within 60 days before the end of the term of the member, the position shall remain vacant until filled as part of the regular appointment process by which the mayor shall appoint the member, subject to the approval of the city commission, at the first commission meeting in May of each year. 
(i)  Representation by member of third parties. No member of a board shall represent a third party in any proceeding before such board to which the member belongs. 
(j)  Role and responsibility of members of subsidiary boards of the City of Winter Park. Members of subsidiary municipal boards shall have such authority as provided by law, including ordinances of the City of Winter Park and the City Charter. No member of a board shall exceed his or her delegated authority, and except to the extent Florida law or an ordinance or Charter provision expressly requires the board to perform an adjudicatory function as a quasi-judicial board, the function and duty of each subsidiary board and the members of those boards is limited to acting in an advisory capacity only, by which the members of the various city boards are authorized to receive and gather information, attend board meetings, and apply their best efforts to render advice and recommendations to the Commission of the City of Winter Park in the interest of the city and its residents. Although city boards may make recommendations concerning provisions of the City Code, no member of a city board shall, by virtue of such office, have the authority to represent the City of Winter Park in any action to enforce the City Code or any provision thereof. 
(k)  Term in office and reappointment. Unless otherwise required by Florida Statutes or City Charter, each member of the city's boards shall have an initial term of three years in office and may be reappointed to one additional consecutive three-year term. Following a break in service of at least one year, a former member may be appointed again to the same board subject to the limitation expressed herein, that the term shall be for three years with an opportunity to be reappointed for one three-year term immediately following the expiration of the initial three-year term. For good cause shown, the mayor may waive this term limitation, subject to approval by majority vote of the commission. The serving of a partial term of office on a city board shall not count towards the term limits set forth in this subsection. 
(l)  Attendance, participation by telephone, and procedures if there is lack of a quorum. Each member of a city board shall be automatically terminated from the board if the member misses three consecutive meetings, or if the member is absent from more than 50 percent of the scheduled meetings of the board in any 12-month period. Each member of a city board may participate in a meeting by telephone if he or she gives good cause for the need to appear by telephone, and in such instances the appearance by telephone shall be counted as the member being present at the meeting. However, a member participating by telephone may only vote if a physical quorum is present at the meeting, and votes and other action may not be taken at a meeting unless a quorum of members is physically present at the meeting. Notwithstanding, if a quorum is not physically present, the members who are in attendance may vote to adjourn the meeting for lack of a quorum. And, so long as a meeting is properly noticed and is in compliance with the requirements of the Sunshine Law, less than a quorum of a board may meet for purposes of discussion so long as there is no action or vote taken at such meeting. 
(m)  Evaluation process. Each city board shall make provision for an annual self-evaluation process by which it and the individual board members are evaluated, and the activity and accomplishments of each board shall thus be annually evaluated and reported to the commission. The city manager shall work with the presiding officer or designee of each city board to insure that the report concerning the evaluation of each board member and each board is presented to the city commissioner prior to the first day of April each year to insure that the information is available before the annual appointment of members at the first meeting in May of each year. The city manager shall develop a standard city form and format for evaluations that will be used for each subsidiary board of the city. The city manager shall recommend the evaluation instrument and format and the city commission shall approve the same with such revisions as the commission determines may be appropriate.

(b)  It is the legislative intent of the city commission to provide for the establishment of the code compliance board as an additional or supplemental means of obtaining compliance with such codes and ordinances.

Sec. 2-104. - Enforcement procedures. 
(a)  It shall be the duty of the code inspector to initiate enforcement proceedings of the various codes and ordinances. No member of the code compliance board shall have the power to initiate such enforcement proceedings. 
(b)  Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section, if a violation of the codes or ordinances is found, the code inspector shall first notify the violator and give him a reasonable time to correct the violation. Should the violation continue beyond the time specified for correction, the code inspector shall notify the code compliance board and request a hearing. The code compliance board, through its clerical staff, shall schedule a hearing, and written notice of such hearing shall be mailed or hand delivered to the violator as provided in this division. At the option of the code compliance board, notice may additionally be served by publication as provided in this division. If the violation is corrected and then recurs or if the violation is not corrected by the time specified for correction by the code inspector, the case may be presented to the code compliance board even if the violation has been corrected prior to the board hearing, and the notice shall so state. 
(c)  If the code inspector has reason to believe a violation or the condition causing the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the code inspector shall make a reasonable effort to notify the violator and may immediately notify the board and request a hearing. 
(d)  If a repeat violation is found, the code inspector shall notify the violator but is not required to give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation. The code inspector, upon notifying the violator of a repeat violation, shall notify the code compliance board and request a hearing. The code compliance board, through its clerical staff, shall schedule a hearing and shall provide notice as provided in this division. The case may be presented to the code compliance board even if the repeat violation has been corrected prior to the board hearing, and the notice shall so state. If the repeat violation has been corrected, the code compliance board retains the right to schedule a hearing to determine costs and impose the payment of reasonable enforcement fees upon the repeat violator. The repeat violator may choose to waive his or her rights to this hearing and pay said costs as determined by the code compliance board. 
(e)  If the owner of property which is subject to an enforcement proceeding before the code compliance board transfers ownership of such property between the time of service of the notice of hearing before the code compliance board and the time of the hearing, such owner shall: 
(1)  Disclose, in writing, the existence and the nature of the proceeding to the prospective transferee. 
(2)  Deliver to the prospective transferee a copy of the pleadings, notices, and other materials relating to the code enforcement proceeding received by the transferor. 
(3)  Disclose, in writing, to the prospective transferee that the new owner will be responsible for compliance with the applicable code and with orders issued in the code enforcement proceeding. 
(4)  File a notice with the code enforcement official of the transfer of the property, with the identity and address of the new owner and copies of the disclosures made to the new owner, within five days after the date of the transfer. 
    A failure to make the disclosures described in subparagraphs (1), (2) and (3) before the transfer creates a rebuttable presumption of fraud. If the property is transferred before the hearing, the proceeding shall not be dismissed, but the new owner shall be provided a reasonable period of time to correct the violation before the hearing is held.

Sec. 2-105. - Conduct of hearing. 
(a)  Upon request of the code inspector or at such other times as may be necessary, the chairperson of the code compliance board may call hearings of the board, and hearings may also be called by written notice signed by at least three members of the board. The board at any hearing may set a future hearing date. 
(b)  Upon scheduling a hearing, the board shall cause notice thereof to be furnished to the alleged violator as provided in this division. The notice of hearing shall contain the date, time and place of the hearing and shall state the nature of the violation and refer to the appropriate code or ordinance. 
(c)  At the hearing, the burden of proof shall be upon the code inspector to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a violation does exist. 
(d)  Assuming proper notice of the hearing has been provided to the alleged violator as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a hearing may proceed in the absence of the alleged violator. 
(e)  All testimony shall be under oath and shall be recorded. The board shall take testimony from the code inspector and alleged violator and from such other witnesses as may be called by the respective sides. 
(f)  Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental due process shall be observed and govern the proceedings. 
(g)  Irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded, but all other evidence of a type commonly relied upon by reasonable, prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs shall be admissible, whether or not such evidence would be admissible in a trial in the courts of the state. 
(h)  Any member of the board or an attorney appointed to represent the board may inquire of any witness before the board. The alleged violator or his attorney and the attorney or staff person representing the city shall be permitted to inquire of any witness before the board and shall be permitted to present brief opening and closing statements. 
(i)  If the city prevails in prosecuting a case before the code compliance board, the city shall be entitled to recover all costs incurred in prosecuting the case before the board, and such costs may be included in the lien authorized under subsection 2-108(e). 
(j)  At the conclusion of the hearing, the code compliance board shall issue findings of fact, based on evidence of record and conclusions of law, and shall issue an order affording the proper relief consistent with the powers granted by state law and by this division. The finding shall be by motion approved by a majority of those members present and voting; provided, however, that at least four members of the board must vote in order for the action to be official. The order shall be stated orally at the meeting and shall be reduced to writing and mailed or hand delivered to the alleged violator either at or within a reasonable time after the hearing. The order may include a notice that it must be complied with by a specified date and that a fine may be imposed and, under the conditions specified in section 2-108(a), the cost of repairs may be included along with the fine if the order is not complied with by such date. A certified copy of such order may be recorded in the public records of the county and shall constitute notice to any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest or assigns if the violation concerns real property, and the findings therein shall be binding upon the violator and, if the violation concerns real property, any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest or assigns. If an order is recorded in the public records pursuant to this subsection and the order is complied with by the date specified in the order, the code compliance board shall issue an order acknowledging compliance that shall be recorded in the public records. A hearing is not required to issue such an order acknowledging compliance.

    The code compliance board shall have the power to: 
(1)  Adopt rules for the conduct of its hearings.

State Law reference- Similar provisions, F.S. § 162.08. 
Sec. 2-107. - Administrative fines; costs of repair; liens. 
(a)  The code compliance board, upon notification by the code inspector that a previous order of the board has not been complied with by the set time or upon finding that a repeat violation has been committed, may order the violator to pay a fine in an amount specified in this section for each day the violation continues past the date set by the code compliance board for compliance or, in the case of a repeat violation, for each day the repeat violation continues, beginning with the date the repeat violation is found to have occurred by the code inspector. In addition, if the violation is a violation described in subsection 2-105(c), the code compliance board shall notify the city, which may make all reasonable repairs which are required to bring the property into compliance and charge the violator with the reasonable cost of the repairs along with the fine imposed pursuant to this section. Making such repairs does not create a continuing obligation on the part of the city to make further repairs or to maintain the property and does not create any liability against the city for any damages to the property if such repairs were completed in good faith. If a finding of a violation or a repeat violation has been made as provided in this part, a hearing shall not be necessary for issuance of the order imposing the fine. If, after due notice and hearing, the code compliance board finds a violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may order the violator to pay a fine as specified in subsection (b). 
(b)  A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall not exceed $250.00 per day for a first violation and shall not exceed $500.00 per day for a repeat violation, and, in addition, may include all costs of repairs pursuant to subsection (a). However, if the code compliance board finds the violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may impose a fine not to exceed $5,000.00 per violation. 
(c)  In determining the amount of the fine, if any, the code compliance board shall consider the following factors: 
(1)  The gravity of the violation; 
(2)  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; and 
(3)  Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
(d)  The code compliance board may reduce a fine imposed pursuant to this section. 
(e)  A certified copy of an order imposing a fine, or a fine plus repair costs, may be recorded in the public records and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order shall be enforceable in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of the state, including execution and levy against the personal property of the violator, but such order shall not be deemed otherwise to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered in a suit to foreclose on a lien filed pursuant to this section, whichever occurs first. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this section runs in favor of the city, and the city may execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered pursuant to this section. After three months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the code compliance board may authorize the city attorney to foreclose on the lien or to sue to recover a money judgment for the amount of the lien plus accrued interest. Actions for money judgments may be pursued only on fines levied after October 1, 2000. No lien created pursuant to the provisions of this section may be foreclosed on real property which is a homestead under Fla. Const. art. X, § 4. The money judgment provisions of this section shall not apply to real property or personal property which is covered under Fla. Const. art. X, § 4. 
(f)  No lien provided by this chapter shall continue for a period longer than 20 years after the certified copy of an order imposing a fine has been recorded, unless within that time an action is commenced pursuant to F.S. § 162.09(3) in a court of competent jurisdiction. In an action to foreclose on a lien or for a money judgment, the prevailing party is entitled to recover all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee, that the party incurs in the action. The city shall be entitled to collect all costs incurred in recording and satisfying a valid lien. The continuation of the lien effected by the commencement of the action shall not be good against creditors or subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, unless a notice of lis pendens is recorded.

(a)  An aggrieved party, including the city commission, may appeal a final administrative order of the code compliance board to the circuit court. Any such appeal shall be filed within 30 days of the execution of the order to be appealed. 
(b)  The scope of review shall be limited to the record made before the code compliance board and shall not be a trial de novo. 
(c)  The city commission shall, by rule, establish reasonable charges for the preparation of the record to be paid by the appealing party.

Sec. 2-109. - Notices. 
(a)  All notices required by this division shall be provided to the alleged violator by: 
(1)  Certified mail, return receipt requested, provided if such notice is sent under this paragraph to the owner of the property in question at the address listed in the tax collector's office for tax notices, and at any other address provided to the city by such owner and is returned as unclaimed or refused, notice may be provided by posting as described in subparagraphs (b)(1) and (2) and by first-class mail directed to the addresses furnished to the local government with a properly executed proof of mailing or affidavit confirming the first-class mailing; 
(2)  Hand delivery by the sheriff or other law enforcement officer, code inspector or other person designated by the city commission; 
(3)  Leaving the notice at the violator's usual place of residence with any person residing therein who is above 15 years of age and informing such person of the contents of the notice; or 
(4)  In the case of commercial premises, leaving the notice with the manager or other person in charge. 
(b)  In addition to providing notice as set forth in subsection (a) of this section, at the option of the code compliance board, notice may also be served by publication, as follows: 
(1)  Such notice shall be published once during each week for four consecutive weeks (four publications being sufficient) in a newspaper of general circulation in the county. The newspaper shall meet such requirements as are prescribed under F.S. ch. 50 for legal and official advertisements. 
(2)  Proof of publication shall be made as provided in F.S. §§ 50.041 and 50.051. 
(c)  In lieu of publication as described in subsection (b), such notice may be posted at least ten days prior to the hearing, or prior to the expiration of any deadline contained in the notice, in at least two locations, one of which shall be the property upon which the violation is alleged to exist and the other of which shall be at city hall in Winter Park, Florida. Proof of posting shall be by affidavit of the person posting the notice, which affidavit shall include a copy of the notice posted and the date and places of its posting. 
(d)  Notice by publication may run concurrently with or may follow an attempt to provide notice by hand delivery or by mail as required under subsection (a) of this section. 
(e)  Evidence that an attempt has been made to hand deliver or mail notice as provided in subsection (a) of this section, together with proof of publication as provided in subsection (b) of this section, shall be sufficient to show that the notice requirements of this division have been met, without regard to whether or not the alleged violator actually received such notice.

(a)  Article IV, Administration, of the Charter provides that there shall be a city manager who shall be the administrative head of the city, responsible to the city commission for the administration of all city affairs placed in his charge by or under the Charter or by direction of the city commission. Section 4.05 of the Charter sets forth the powers and duties of the city manager. In addition to those duties set forth in the Charter, the office of the city manager shall also be responsible for the data processing and purchasing functions of the city. 
(b)  The city clerk shall serve as clerk of the city commission and perform such other duties of a like nature as shall be required by the city commission, including the responsibility for the recording, filing, indexing and safekeeping of all proceedings of the city commission and maintenance of all election records. The city clerk shall be custodian of the city seal. The city clerk shall be under the direction and supervision of the city manager. In organizing the office of the city manager, the head of data processing, head of purchasing and the city clerk shall not be considered as department heads as that term is used in the Charter. 
(c)  Adoption of Public Records Act policy. 
(1)  Introduction. It is the policy of the City of Winter Park ("city") that all municipal records, with the exception of exempted records identified by F.S. § 119.07 or other applicable sections of Florida Statutes, shall be open for personal inspection by any person. 
"Public records" means all documents, papers, letters, maps, books, tapes, photographs, films, sound recordings, data processing software, or other material, regardless of the physical form, characteristics, or means of transmission, made or received pursuant to law or ordinance or in connection with the transaction of official business by the city. (F.S., § 119.011(1)). 
(2)  Objective. The purpose of this policy is to affirm the public's right to access city records, to set forth the procedures that will facilitate accessibility of information to members of the public, and to establish fees to be levied by the city to cover the cost of responding to public records requests. 
(3)  Effective date. This policy will become effective immediately upon adoption of the ordinance from which this subsection derives. 
(4)  Procedure. 
a.  Processing public records requests. The city clerk/city manager have the authority to determine that the request is routine and can appropriately be handled by a department head or other staff person at a department level. In that case, the person requesting public records will be directed to schedule a time to examine the records and to make copies at his or her cost (see costs below). 
The city clerk is the official custodian of all city records, and any person requesting records is on notice that there may be a delay in receiving access to public records if he or she requests records from someone other than the city clerk. 
Although requests are not required to be in writing, a written request will facilitate clear communication and a concise statement of what is being requested and is encouraged. Requestors should specify whether they wish to simply inspect records or obtain copies. 
Any city employee who receives a request for this type of information should comply as soon as practicable. After assisting the requestor, staff should transmit information regarding any unusual requests to the city clerk's office. The city clerk will determine if the nature of the request requires a copy be sent to the city attorney. The city clerk does not need to be informed of routine requests; only ones requiring extensive time and research. 
If departments that have records in their possession indicate that the retrieval of the records will take more than 20 minutes in order to retrieve, produce, maintain custody of and to return the records, staff will provide the requestor with an estimate of the cost for doing such work. The estimate should include sufficient information so that the person requesting the records will understand the scope of work involved that justifies the estimate amount of time and deposit amount. 
The person requesting can either schedule on a reasonable basis a review of the records (which will require supervision because of the need to maintain security of the records; and that time spent in supervising may trigger the right to receive a deposit for extraordinary work) or may pay for a copy of all the records with the cost of shipping added to the bill if it is mailed. Payment should be received before copies are made and mailed. 
Departments should provide the city clerk's office with the name and hourly pay rate of the employee who will be doing the retrieval for requests requiring a significant amount of time to complete. They should select the lowest paid employee capable of efficiently retrieving the records. No benefits multiplier shall be added to the labor charge. The city clerk's office shall notify the requestor of the estimate and confirm whether the requestor is willing to pay the labor charges and copying charges, if any. A request will be made by the city clerk for a deposit for extraordinary requests. The city clerk's office will confirm with the requestor that the city must be paid in advance of the requestor's receipt of the records. 
Exemptions must be identified promptly. Exceptions are generally found in [F.S.] § 119.071, but there are other exemptions provided in the law. Requests for documents which may contain information which is exempt from disclosure under Florida law may be delayed until the records can be reviewed and redacted as necessary by the custodian of the records. The city attorney's office should be contacted for clarification of exemptions under F.S. ch. 119 that you are unsure of. 
The public records law does not require staff to create or reassemble records in a new format. The law only requires staff to provide access to records that already exist. Also, the public records law does not require staff to answer questions or to conduct analysis. 
Media requests. Requests from the media for public records shall be handled consistently with the procedures outlined above. All staff members receiving a request directly from the media shall immediately inform the communications department of the request. 
b.  Charges for public records. 
1.  General. 
i.  The charge for a duplication of a one-sided letter size (81/2? × 11?), legal size (81/2? × 14?) or oversize (11? × 17?) document, capable of being reproduced on existing city equipment, shall be $0.15 per copy. Duplication of two-sided pages shall be $0.20 per copy. 
ii.  For large, single documents not covered above (i.e., blueprints, maps, plats, etc.), the charge shall be the actual cost to the city for outside reproduction. 
iii.  For books and other multi-page volumes printed by the city (i.e., annual budget, growth management plan, various financial reports), the charge shall be the actual cost for outside reproduction. 
iv.  The charge for a certified copy of a public record shall be $1.00 per certification, plus the applicable copying charges. 
v.  If documents are easily retrieved and readily available, there should be no charge unless there is a substantial amount of copies made, then only charge for the copies. 
2.  Multi-media public requests. 
i.  If a photographic reproduction is requested, the charge shall be the actual cost for outside reproduction. 
ii.  The charge for CDs is $5.00 each. Copies of video tapes or other such media shall be the cost to the city, plus applicable labor charges. 
3.  Labor charges. For extraordinary requests requiring more than 20 minutes of staff time, a labor charge will be imposed. Such charge shall be the result of the employee's hourly rate of pay, and benefits, multiplied by the actual time worked to accommodate the request and measure in tenths of an hour. The benefits to be charged shall include all regular employee benefits that have an hourly dollar value, associated with the personnel performing the work, including health insurance and any pension or retirement contribution. 
4.  Revenue collection and receipts. A receipt for payment of costs associated with public records shall be given to the requestor upon payment of the levied fee. All fees collected shall be forwarded to the finance department for deposit in the city's general fund. 
5.  Access to records. 
i.  For the purpose of this policy, "reasonable" time to provide access to public records is during normal working hours Monday-Friday, 8:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m. At all times records will be inspected, reviewed and copied under supervision by the custodian of the public records requested, or the custodian's designee, pursuant to F.S. § 119.07(4)(d). 
ii.  A reasonable special service charge will be imposed based on the actual labor cost for clerical personnel who may be required due to the nature or volume of a public records request to safeguard such records from loss or destruction during their inspection. 
6.  Uniform application of public records law. The city will comply in a uniform manner to all requests for public records, and the charges authorized by law will be assessed and charged for all requests, including the requirement for a deposit for requests that require extensive clerical or administrative time. However, notwithstanding the requirement the charges will be uniformly applied as allowed by law, the city manager shall have the discretion to waive charges for public records that would be equal to $1.00 or less. 
(5)  Law enforcement records. Copies of law enforcement records shall be subject to fees as outlined in F.S. § 321.23. 
Media inquiries and public records requests received directly by the police department will be processed as outlined in Winter Park Police Department Standard Operating Procedures. 
(6)  Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) patient record package. All requests for patient records related [to] city ambulance transport services are established in the city's fee schedule. The city is not a licensed medical provider as described in F.S. § 458.309, F.A.C. 64B8-10.003 and therefore has established a separate fee for generating these records.

(Code 1960, § 2-10) 
Sec. 2-188. - Purchases, signature authority and contracts. 
(a)  All purchases shall conform to such policies and regulations as the city commission may from time to time prescribe by ordinance or resolution. A Procurement Policy shall be established and amended from time to time by city commission approval to govern the procurement process. 
(b)  Except as provided in subsections (d), (e) and (f) of this section, all contracts to which the City of Winter Park is a party must be approved by the city commission at a public meeting, the approval of the contract duly recorded in the minutes of the meeting and a true and correct copy thereof being available and maintained in the records of the city showing the date and official approval by vote of the city commission of the City of Winter Park. This provision does not prevent the city manager from negotiating, securing and signing a written contract or agreement that is subject to and contingent upon city commission approval before it becomes enforceable against the city. 
(c)  Either the mayor or the city manager shall have the authority to sign contracts and agreements approved by the city commission and related documents and instruments needed to consummate the approval of the city commission. Both the city manager and procurement manager shall each have the authority to issue and sign purchase orders approved by the city commission. For real estate transactions approved by the city commission, the mayor shall execute any deeds, leases and easements conveying real property or an interest in real property owned by the city, however either the mayor or city manager shall have the authority to execute any closing documents on behalf of the city consummating a transaction in which the city is acquiring real property or an interest in real property. For the issuance of debt approved by the city commission or by referendum, the mayor (or the deputy mayor in the absence of the mayor) shall execute bonds or notes issued by the city. 
(d)  The city manager shall have purchase, contract and agreement approval and signature (or execution) authority, without city commission approval, up to a certain threshold set forth in the procedures, policies and regulations the city commission may prescribe by ordinance or resolution from time to time. The city manager's contract approval authority shall be subject to all of the following conditions being present and satisfied by the terms of the contract: 
(1)  The contract will not obligate the city to expend funds in excess of the city manager's purchase order authority then existing at the time the contract is entered. 
(2)  No term of the contract shall require the City of Winter Park to indemnify or hold harmless a private party unless the city's liability is capped at the limits of liability of F.S. § 768.28(5) regardless of the type or basis of the claim. 
(3)  No term of the contract shall waive the sovereign immunity of the City of Winter Park, nor shall any provision in the contract increase the city's limit of liability pursuant to F.S. § 768.28, as that statute may be amended. 
(4)  No term of the contract shall provide for venue of any litigation to occur outside of Orange County, Florida, and no term will apply the law of any state other than Florida. 
(5)  If the contract is one of purchase, then to the extent applicable, all city regulations (including the provisions of the Procurement Policy) shall be followed in selecting the vendor for the contract. 
(6)  No contract that transfers, conveys or grants any interest in real estate owned by the City of Winter Park may be entered except upon a majority vote of the city commission. The types of contracts or interests that are subject to this requirement include contracts selling or leasing city property and easements encumbering city property. However, if the city manager finds that it is in the interest of the city to do so, the city manager shall have the authority to approve and execute agreements authorizing by license the encroachment of a property owner's improvements within a city drainage easement or utility easement with terms and in a form acceptable to the city manager. 
(7)  Notwithstanding the requirement that the mayor or city manager shall not enter a contract that exceeds the city manager's purchase order authority, the city commission finds that an exception is warranted when it is necessary to purchase materials pursuant to the direct purchase sales tax savings program and a delay in purchasing the materials to first obtain commission approval may result in a delay of a public works construction project. Accordingly, as an exception, the city manager or mayor shall have the authority to issue a purchase order for materials that will be incorporated into a public works project of the city, the purchase is pursuant to the owner direct purchase sales tax savings program, and the funds for the project, including the materials to be purchased, are included in the city's budget for the project. The city manager will report all purchase orders to the city commission that are issued pursuant to this exception at the next commission meeting. 
    If these conditions are satisfied, then either the city manager or mayor shall be authorized to enter the contract on behalf of the City of Winter Park if the city manager finds that it is in the interest of the city to do so. Further, the city commission may delegate by way of the adoption of a Procurement Policy certain limited purchasing approval and signature authority to the city's procurement manager who is under the supervision of the city manager. All contracts so entered shall be maintained as part of the city's records and will be available through the office of the city manager or designee thereof. 
(e)  The city manager shall have the authority to approve and execute easement or license agreements that grant an easement or license to the city if the city manager finds such to be in the interest of the city to do so and any city expenditure relating to such, if any, is below the city manager's purchasing authority. Such easements or licenses in favor of the city include those matters relating to, rights-of-entry, temporary construction, sidewalks, bike or pedestrian trails, stormwater drainage, electric utilities, water utilities and sewer utilities. The mayor shall also have the authority to sign easement or license agreements approved by the city manager under this subsection. 
(f)  Without limiting the foregoing authority set forth above, in recognition of the city manager's duties and need to operate the city on a day to day basis, the city manager shall have the authority to execute documents, orders, agreements and contracts on behalf of the city for which the city is not required to expend funds and which are consistent with the role and duties of the city manager as prescribed by the City Charter or by ordinance, resolution or directive of the city commission.

    This article is adopted pursuant to Article VIII of the Constitution of the State of Florida, F.S. ch. 166, section 2.11 of the City Charter, and other applicable provisions of law. 
(Ord. No. 2267, § 3, 7-14-98) 
Sec. 2-191. - Definitions. 
    [The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:]

    Dwelling shall mean any structure or portion thereof intended for residential use, including, but not limited to a house, duplex, apartment or condominium. 
    Dwelling unit shall mean any portion of a multiple-family dwelling consisting of its own sleeping quarters and constituting a separate residence for single-family occupancy.

    New development or newly developed shall mean the construction of a structure to improve or alter real property, either from its natural state or where there exists or once existed another structure, to facilitate a residential, retail, commercial, office, or industrial use. 
    Nonresidential unit shall mean any retail store or single occupancy commercial structure; each individual retail space in a multiple occupancy retail structure; each individual commercial space in a multiple-occupancy commercial structure; any single occupancy industrial structure; each individual space in a multiple occupancy industrial structure; any single occupancy office building; each individual office space in a multiple occupancy office building; and any warehouse or any unit in a warehouse facility subdivided into individual units and used primarily as leased storage space.

    A fee to be known as the interim proprietary and general services fee is hereby established. 
(Ord. No. 2267, § 3, 7-14-98) 
Sec. 2-193. - Purpose. 
    The cost for city services is borne in large part through ad valorem taxation. Between the time that a new structure is completed and occupied and the time the value of the new structure on such real property is reflected on the county's tax roll (usually as of the ensuing January 1st), the city is obligated to provide city services for which part of the cost of said services is not compensated. The interim proprietary and general services fee will defray the cost to the city in providing city services to newly-developed real properties and their occupants prior to the imposition of ad valorem taxes on said property. The fee is not in any manner, directly or indirectly, intended as an ad valorem tax, nor is the amount of the fee established herein related to the valuation of the property receiving and benefitting from said city services. The fee will be equitably distributed and will reasonably cover the cost of making such city services available to newly-developed real properties and their occupants. 
(Ord. No. 2267, § 3, 7-14-98) 
Sec. 2-194. - Fee levied for services to certain properties. 
    There is hereby levied an interim proprietary and general services fee which shall apply to those real properties located within the city limits with structures, either permanent or temporary, for which a certificate of occupancy is required, for full or partial use of the premises, and which shall cover the period from the date of issuance of the certificate of occupancy until and including the ensuing December 31st (i.e. the day normally preceding the date the structure necessitating the certificate of occupancy is assessed by the Orange County property appraiser and extended on the tax roll). 
(Ord. No. 2267, § 3, 7-14-98) 
Sec. 2-195. - Fee; when paid. 
    The interim proprietary and general services fee shall be paid in full by the owner of the real property prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, and the certificate of occupancy shall not be issued until such time as the interim proprietary and general services fee has been paid. 
(Ord. No. 2267, § 3, 7-14-98) 
Sec. 2-195.1. - Rate charged. 
    The interim proprietary and general services fee shall be imposed at the following initial rates, according to land use: 
(1)  For residential units: 
a.  For each single-family dwelling, per year ..... $ 200.00 
b.  For each dwelling unit within a multiple-family dwelling unit or long-term care nursing home, per year ..... 200.00 
(2)  For lodging units: 
a.  For each room or sleeping quarter in a hotel, motel or other lodging establishment, per year ..... $ 238.00 
b.  For nonresidential units (such fee, for convenience, is stated in terms of every 1,000 square feet, but the actual assessment shall be prorated on each square foot): 
1.  For every 1,000 square feet of space in an industrial building or warehouse or in each individual unit of a subdivided warehouse or storage facility, per year ..... 124.00 
2.  For every 1,000 square feet of retail space or commercial space in a retail store or commercial structure, respectively, or for every 1,000 square feet of retail space or commercial space in each unit of a multiple occupancy retail or commercial structure, per year ..... 308.00 
3.  For every 1,000 square feet of office space in a single occupancy office building or in each unit of a multiple occupancy office building, per year ..... 358.00 
Such fees will be imposed, at the applicable rates, from the date the certificate of occupancy is issued through and including the following December 31st, on a prorated daily basis. The building official shall have the authority to determine which one of the above land uses, and its respective rate, best applies to a particular structure not otherwise definitively classified. 
(Ord. No. 2267, § 3, 7-14-98) 
Sec. 2-195.2. - Fee revisions. 
    Upon the recommendation of the city manager, the city commission may, by adoption of a resolution, revise the interim proprietary and general services fee rate by increasing or decreasing the annual rate and rounding to the nearest dollar. Any rate revision to the interim proprietary and general services fee shall take effect on the January 1st that follows the adoption of the rate revision by the city commission. The revised fee shall be calculated based upon a reasonable estimate of the annual net cost of all city services divided by the total number of residential, nonresidential, and lodging units actually existing and those estimated to be built as of April 1st of the year in which the revised fee is to be adopted, then adjusting that cost for each of the respective land uses (based upon population, employment, and customer impact factors and upon the service demand for each such land use). The fee shall be stated in annual dollar rates, but shall be assessed on a prorated daily basis. The fee, however, may only be revised once a year and may not be increased by more than 25 percent from one year to the next. 
(Ord. No. 2267, § 3, 7-14-98)

(3)  Property that would otherwise be totally exempt from ad valorem taxation. (There shall be no partial exemption from the interim proprietary and general services fee for any property partially exempt from ad valorem taxation.); or 
(4)  Property owned and operated by federal, state or local government and used for a governmental or public purpose, or government owned property leased to a person or organization which uses the property exclusively for tax-exempt purposes under state or federal laws. 
(b)  Any claim of exemption under subsections (a)(1) through (4), above, must be made at the time of application for the building permit; any claim made subsequent thereto shall be considered untimely and not entitled to an exemption. The property owner must present to the building official sufficient and satisfactory documentation to verify that the property owner or property owner's land use qualifies for one of the above exemptions. 
(Ord. No. 2267, § 3, 7-14-98) 
Sec. 2-195.4. - Lien provisions. 
(a)  Any form of payment of the interim proprietary and general services fee which, subsequent to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy, is not honored or accepted, for whatever reason, shall remain due and payable and shall constitute, and is hereby imposed as, a special assessment lien against the real property upon which such fee remains due; and until fully paid and discharged, or otherwise barred by law from being assessed, shall remain a lien equal in rank and dignity with the lien of a city or county for ad valorem taxes and senior in dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles, and claims in, to or against the real property containing the structure. Such special assessment lien may be enforced by any of the methods provided for in F.S. ch. 85, or in the alternative, foreclosure proceedings may be instituted under F.S. ch. 173, or the collection and enforcement thereof may be accomplished by other methods allowed by law. 
(b)  The owner shall pay all costs associated with enforcement and collection of an unpaid interim proprietary and general services fee, including reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, abstracting expenses and other related costs incurred.

Sec. 2-196. - Authority; intent. 
    This article is enacted under the home rule power of the city and pursuant to the provisions of F.S. § 286.0115.

All vendors licensed under the state beverage laws desiring to remain open for business for the purposes of selling, offering for sale, delivering, serving or permitting consumption of alcoholic beverages between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m. on any weekday or Saturday, and between 11:00 p.m. and midnight on Sunday, shall make application with the business tax department for an extended hours of operation permit. For the city's fiscal year 2008/2009, vendors shall submit an application within 30 days from the effective date of this ordinance. 
(2)  The application form shall be provided by the city. The vendor shall complete the application by providing the information requested about the vendor, including but not limited to the name and address where notices related to this section are to be mailed. Permit holders are required to amend the license application that is on file with the City of Winter Park within 30 days of any change in the information set forth on the application form. 
(3)  The city manager or designee shall review the application and, if the application is complete, a permit shall be issued to the vendor to remain open between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m. on weekdays and Saturday, or between 11:00 p.m. and midnight on Sunday, unless the applicant or property is at that time subject to a suspension of extended hours of operation permit under this section, in which case the applicant will not be eligible for an extended hours of operation permit until the applicant and property are no longer subject to such a suspension. 
(4)  Such permit must be renewed annually on or before the 30th day of September of each year, unless the permit has been suspended by the City of Winter Park or the vendor's state beverage license has been revoked. The city will provide an appropriate form and allow the extended hours of operation permit to be applied for at the same time as the alcoholic beverages sales permit required by the city. In the event that there has been a change in ownership or a change in location of the establishment, the city must be notified immediately and a new application must be processed. Failure to renew the extended hours of operation permit shall be cause for the immediate suspension of extended hours privileges pursuant to subsection (7) below. 
(5)  No vendor may sell alcoholic beverages after 11:00 p.m. unless it has received an extended hours of operation permit from the city. 
(6)  The provisions of this section shall not impair or impact an establishment's right to remain open prior to midnight. 
(7)  Permit suspension. The ability to sell, offer for sale, deliver or permit to be consumed upon the premises any alcoholic beverage beyond the hour of 11:00 p.m. on any day of the week is hereby declared to be and is a privilege subject to suspension by the city commission, and no person may reasonably rely on a continuation of that privilege. As a condition of the continuation of the privilege, vendors are required to take all necessary steps to minimize the negative impacts that their establishment may cause in nearby residential or commercial neighborhoods. The city commission shall consider the following in deciding whether to suspend or condition the privilege: 
a.  Whether there is adequate off-street parking in relation to the demands created during the extra hours of operation, with special regard to any adverse impact on adjacent areas of any illegal or hazardous parking. For the purposes of this section, sufficient evidence of an adverse impact on adjacent residential areas will exist upon verification by police or parking enforcement officials that more than ten vehicles of patrons of the vendor have parked illegally on public rights-of-way or property, or on private properties, upon receipt of a complaint made by the property owner(s). This provision will only apply if the parking provided by the vendor is determined to be inadequate given the size of the crowds that the vendor draws; 
b.  Law enforcement activities on the vendor's property during the extra hours of operation, both outside and inside the permitted location, with particular emphasis on vandalism, and illegal activity of any kind by employees, or others associated with the establishment, including allowing underage drinking, violation of open container laws and loitering by intoxicated individuals. The city commission shall also consider whether the need for law enforcement involvement was the result of the establishment's failure or inability to maintain proper order and control during the extended business hours; 
c.  Complaints verified by the police, arising from adverse effects extended hours of operation have upon neighboring properties, including complaints concerning the effects of noise, illegal parking, violations of the zoning code or noise ordinance with respect to amplified musical entertainment, vandalism, generation of trash or garbage, loitering by intoxicated persons or exterior lighting on neighboring residential properties. It shall be a defense to the applicability of this section that the vendor has adequate security personnel and has implemented a policy requiring that security personnel patrol the premises and the property adjacent to the vendor, as well as all known parking lots that patrons use, to assure the orderly conduct of patrons as they arrive at the establishment or as they depart. Upon a showing of such security precautions, the vendor shall only be held accountable if the conduct complained of constitutes a violation by the vendor of any provision of the City of Winter Park Code of Ordinances; 
d.  Violations of any provisions of the City of Winter Park Code of Ordinances; 
e.  Failure to obtain an extended hours of operation permit, or failure to renew the permit as required by subsections (4) and (5) above; 
f.  Violations of laws relating to the maximum permissible occupancy of vendor; 
g.  Violation of any provisions of the City of Winter Park Code of Ordinances, state or federal law. 
In order to invoke the enforcement provisions of this section, the activities described hereinabove must be traceable to the particular vendor against whom action is being taken, and also must be verified by police officers on the scene. Although not required, police officers may, at their discretion, issue recorded warnings that shall not be considered a notice of violation, to put the vendor on notice that a particular problem or problems must be addressed and could result in a notice of violation if not corrected. 
(8)  Notice of violation of this section shall be issued to any vendor that meets, or where applicable, fails to meet the criteria established in (7)a., b., c., d., e., f., and g. above. The notice of violation shall be left with the owner, proprietor, or highest ranking employee then on the premises. An additional copy of the notice will also be mailed via U.S. mail, certified, return receipt requested, to the vendor at the street address provided in the application. Proof of delivery by either of these two methods (hand delivery or mail) shall be sufficient to establish receipt by the permit holder. Notices sent by mail that are returned or not accepted for any reason shall be deemed proper notice of the violation, provided that the notice is sent to the person and address named on the application. 
(9)  Should three notices of violation within any three consecutive month period be issued to any vendor, the matter shall be placed on the city commission agenda to consider the vendor's extended hours permit. 
a.  Such agenda item shall be publicly advertised in a newspaper of general circulation at least 14 days prior to any hearing of the agenda item, and written notice of the charges against the vendor shall be provided at least 14 days in advance of the hearing. The notice shall also contain the date, time and place of the hearing. Such notice shall also advise the vendor of the right to be heard, of the right to be represented by counsel, of the right to present sworn testimony on the vendor's behalf, and the right to appeal to circuit court. 
b.  After consideration of the matter and allowing the vendor to be heard, the city commission may take no action, suspend or condition the extended hours privilege, as they deem appropriate. Suspensions shall range from one day in length to a maximum of 90 days. The maximum penalty for a first appearance by a vendor before the city commission shall be 30 days, 60 days for a second appearance and 90 days for all appearances thereafter. The city commission shall base its decision on whether there is substantial, competent evidence presented that supports a finding of noncompliance with the criteria in (7)a., b., c., d., e., f., or g. on three or more occasions during any consecutive three-month period. 
c.  The city commission may require, as a condition of the continuation of the privilege of extra hours of operation, compliance with any reasonable conditions 
d.  The city commission may delegate the responsibility for conducting hearings pursuant to this section to a special magistrate. Any such delegation shall be by resolution. 
(10)  Any vendor that has had an extended hours of operation permit suspended or otherwise conditioned cannot avoid the consequences of the city commission's action by changing its name or corporate status. Upon a showing to the city commission that there has been a legitimate change in ownership at the location affected by the city commission's action(s), the city commission may consider allowing an extended hours of operation permit to issue at the site, subject to applicable conditions, if any, to prevent a recurrence of the harms that caused the earlier action. 
(11)  Vendors who were allowed to serve alcohol under previous ordinance. Those vendors in the city who are as of the effective date of this section allowed to sell or serve alcoholic beverages later than the hours provided in this section ("pre-existing late night vendors") shall be treated as having an extended hours of operation permit through and including September 30, 2009, subject to the same conditions and possibility of suspension as set forth above. As of October 1, 2009, such pre-existing late night vendors shall be required to apply for an extended hours of operation permit in order to continue to serve alcoholic beverages at hours later than those provided in subsection (a) above, and otherwise are subject to the terms of this section. 
(c)  Liquors, beers and wines hours of sale. No vendors licensed under the state beverage law to sell liquor, beer or wine by the package, bottle or original container, for consumption off premises, shall sell or offer for sale or deliver any liquor, beer or wine in the original package bottle or container for consumption off the premises during any hour prohibited by [subsection] (a) above. Businesses covered by this section are also required to obtain an extended hours of operation permit, and are subject to all of the requirements of [sub]section (b). 
(d)  Taking container off premises after hours. It is the intention of this section to prohibit those vendors subject to subsection (c) above from permitting anyone purchasing packing goods in the original container to leave the vendor's premises during the prohibited hours, taking with him in any container any beers, wines, liquors, or alcoholic beverages originally purchased by package, bottle or container, so that the same may be consumed off the premises. It is not the intention of this subsection to conflict with any state laws regarding re-corking of wine bottles by restaurants or bars. 
(e)  Sales by employees during prohibited hours. Any employee of a vendor licensed under the state beverage law shall not sell, or offer for sale, any beers, wines, liquors, or alcoholic beverages of any kind during the prohibited hours. 
(f)  Gifts. It shall be deemed a violation of this section for any person, or any agent, servant or employee of any person licensed under the state beverage law, during the hours prohibited under [subsection] (c) above, to gratuitously give any kind of alcoholic beverage, whether conditioned upon the purchase of any kind of alcoholic beverage or product of any nature, at any inflated price or otherwise, or in the form of a so-called bonus predicated upon another purchase, or as a gift. 
(g)  Notwithstanding the restrictions on hours of sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages within the Westside neighborhood area outlined above in subsection (j), the hours shall be extended for the day starting on December 31st (New Year's Eve) until 1:00 am on the following day, January 1st. 
(h)  When St. Patrick's Day (March 17) falls on a Sunday, the hours shall be extended so that alcoholic beverages may be sold, consumed or served in any licensed premises between the hours of 11:00 a.m. on March 17 and 2:00 a.m. on March 18. 
(i)  The sale, serving or consumption of alcoholic beverages in any establishment licensed to sell alcoholic beverages in accordance with this chapter during hours other than those specified in this section is strictly prohibited. Within the meaning of this section, a sale shall be regarded as being made if the alcoholic beverage is delivered to any person during prohibited hours, regardless of whether payment therefor is made at some other time. If any such licensed vendor is a corporation, the officers of such corporation shall be regarded as the owners thereof for purposes of enforcement of this chapter. 
(j)  The city has established that restaurants, bars, taverns and cocktail lounges in the Westside neighborhood shall be limited in the hours of sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages due to the proximity of churches, residential homes and apartments and the related problems of nighttime activity and noise generated by these establishments. This restriction shall be in effect within the geographic area of the Westside community bounded by Denning Drive, Comstock Avenue, New York Avenue and Webster Avenue. The restriction shall limit the hours of sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages to no later than 11:00 p.m. on Sundays through Thursdays and no later than 12:00 a.m. (midnight) on Fridays and Saturdays.

However, this section shall not apply to vendors either holding or meeting the requirement to hold a class 3 special beverage license, as provided in this chapter.

Such clubs must have a definite fixed method of electing persons to membership in the club, which method must be described by the club's bylaws and must have some relation to the object and purpose of the club.

(c)  Animals employed by any governmental agency and those aiding sight-impaired persons are exempted from this section. 
(d)  Notwithstanding any provision in the Code of Ordinances that generally prohibits dogs in certain parks or areas of parks, the city manager shall have the authority to allow dogs in specified areas in Central Park, with respect to two qualified dog events which apply to the city manager and are approved in accordance with the procedures hereinafter specified. Such written permission shall have the effect of temporarily waiving the application of the provisions in the Code that otherwise would prohibit the presence of dogs. In addition to a maximum of two events in Central Park, the city manager shall have the authority to waive the prohibition against dogs with respect to athletic fields in city parks, but not including Central Park, where dogs would otherwise be prohibited, but these events will be limited to a maximum of five events per year. This authority to waive the prohibition is subject to the following procedures, terms and conditions: 
(1)  A person or group promoting a special event in a "dog prohibited" area of a city park, with respect to a maximum of two events per year allowed in Central Park and a maximum of five events that may take place in athletic fields other than in Central Park where dogs are prohibited, and who wishes to have dogs present, shall request in writing at least 30 calendar days before the scheduled start of the event, a written waiver from the city manager that would allow for dogs to be present during the event. Permission will be granted if all of the requirements set out in this section are met, as determined by the city manager. 
(2)  The applicant must demonstrate that the event requires as a key component of the event the presence of dogs for competition, training or display/performance purposes, and that the event will be in conformance with all requirements of the City Code and other applicable laws. It will not be sufficient that a group or promoter wishes to have dogs present merely for social gathering or dog play activities because the city maintains a dog park for those purposes. 
(3)  The applicant must identify the date or dates of the special event and the times during which the event will be held. The application will also identify the need for allowing dogs to be present during the event and will identify the specific park area(s) in which the event will be held and for which the presence of dogs is requested. 
(4)  The applicant will demonstrate that persons in possession of dogs and the volunteers and staff working for the person or group sponsoring the event will promptly pick up all animal waste using appropriate plastic bags for such purpose, and will properly dispose of the bags containing the animal waste. The applicant must assure the city manager that the premises will be kept and maintained clean and free of dog waste during the event, and the group will clean the park land following the conclusion of the event so that it is left in the condition in which it was received, free of dog waste. 
(5)  The applicant will satisfy the city manager that dogs will be kept on leash at all times while on the premises of any city park unless the applicant specifically requests off-leash dogs, in which case off-leash dogs may be allowed but only during such times when the dogs are engaging in competitions, training or performances which require the dogs to be off leash. If an applicant requests off-leash time, then he, she or it will identify the periods of time during the special events or performances when dogs may be off leash. Permission for off-leash, if granted, will be limited to those specific times and events. 
(6)  If these required conditions are found by the city manager to be satisfied, he shall issue a written waiver specifying the specific areas, dates and times during which dogs may be permitted in areas of the parks, including Central Park, where dogs are otherwise prohibited. The permission to have dogs will be subject to these requirements being adhered to during the event, and the waiver may be revoked immediately upon a finding of a violation. If the applicant has requested, and the city manager has agreed, to grant a waiver that dogs may be off leash, then the written permission shall refer to the events and the approximate times when dogs may temporarily be off leash. 
The city manager may add any other appropriate condition within his discretion that he determines will promote the public interest. 
(7)  Dogs will continue to be prohibited as provided in chapter 18 of the Code of Ordinances except to the extent the city manager has granted a limited waiver in accordance with the requirements of this section. 
(8)  Under no circumstances will there be a waiver of fees for a dog event that is allowed pursuant to this section.

Any suit brought against any officer or employee or member because of such act, event or omission performed by him in the enforcement of any provisions of this code shall be defended by the city until the final termination of the proceedings, unless such person acted in bad faith or with malicious purpose or in a manner exhibiting wanton and willful disregard of human rights or property. 
Section 104.1-104.5 is added to read as follows: 
SECTION 104 POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE BUILDING OFFICIAL 
104.1 General. The building official is hereby authorized and directed to enforce the provisions of this code. The building official shall have the authority to render interpretations of this code and to adopt policies and procedures in order to clarify the application of its provisions. Such interpretations, policies and procedures shall be in compliance with the intent and purpose of this code, and shall not have the effect of waiving requirements specifically provided for in this code. 
104.2 Right of entry. 
104.2.1 Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the provisions of this code, or whenever the building official has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any building or upon any premises any condition or code violation which makes such building, structure, premises, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing systems unsafe, dangerous or hazardous, the building official may enter such building, structure or premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same or to perform any duty imposed upon the building official by this code. If such building or premises are occupied, he shall first present proper credentials and request entry. If such building, structure, or premises are unoccupied, he shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other persons having charge or control of such and request entry. If entry is refused, the building official shall have recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure entry. 
104.2.2 When the building official shall have first obtained a proper inspection warrant or other remedy provided by law to secure entry, no owner or occupant or any other persons having charge, care or control of any building, structure, or premises shall fail or neglect, after proper request is made as herein provided, to promptly permit entry therein by the building official for the purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to this code. 
104.2.3 Determination of substantially improved or substantially damaged existing buildings and structures in flood hazard areas. For applications for reconstruction, rehabilitation, repair, alteration, addition or other improvement of existing buildings or structures located in flood hazard areas, the building official shall determine if the proposed work constitutes substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage. Where the building official determines that the proposed work constitutes substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage, and where required by this code, the building official shall require the building to meet the requirements of Section 1612 Flood Loads. 
104.3 Revocation of permits. The building official is authorized to suspend or revoke a permit issued under the provisions of this code whenever the permit is issued in error or on the basis of incorrect, inaccurate or incomplete information, or for violation of any provision of this building code or the code of ordinances of the city. 
104.4 Misrepresentation of application. The building official may revoke a permit or approval, issued under the provisions of this code, in case there has been any false statement or misrepresentation as to the material fact in the permit application or plans on which the permit or approval was based including unlicensed contracting. 
104.5 Requirements not covered by code. Any requirements necessary for the strength, stability or proper operation of an existing or proposed building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system, or for the public safety, health and general welfare, not specifically covered by this code, shall be determined by the building official. 
Section 105.4 is amended to read as follows: 
105.4 Conditions of permit 
105.4.1 Conditions of permit; permit term and intent. 
105.4.1.1 The building official shall act upon an application for a permit with plans as filed, or as amended, without unreasonable or unnecessary delay. A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and shall not be construed as authority to violate, cancel, alter, or set aside any of the provisions of this code (including the Winter Park Code of Ordinances), nor shall such issuance of a permit prevent the building official from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans or in construction or of violations of this code (including the Winter Park Code of Ordinances). No substantial building site preparation, including but not limited to excavation or placement of fill or foundation construction, shall take place prior to the issuance of a building, foundation or site development permit. Issuance of such permits is limited to meeting all other city site development requirements, and is subject to the approval of the building official. 
105.4.1.2 Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within 6 months after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of 6 months after the time the work is commenced and the building official is authorized to require that any work which has been commenced or completed be removed from the building site unless the permit is extended or renewed as approved by the building official due to extenuating circumstances. 
105.4.1.3 In constructing, renovating or building a new one- or two-family dwelling, additions onto one- or two-family dwellings or accessory buildings work under the permit must be substantially completed within 12 calendar months after the time the work is commenced or else the permit shall become invalid. If such permit becomes invalid, no new permit shall be issued covering the same work or any portion thereof if the effect of such permit would be to allow completion of the work begun under the original permit unless an extension or reinstatement of the original permit is granted by the building official after receiving in writing reasons for the delay in completion of the building for good cause (see Section 105.4.1.7). When extending or reinstating a residential permit the building official may impose additional conditions to limit noise, storage of materials or debris, cleanliness of the building site, work hours, construction worker parking or take other actions that will minimize the negative impact of an active construction project for surrounding properties. Furthermore any structural work partially completed on the property where the permit became invalid shall be removed and the property cleaned to the satisfaction of the building official. If the property owner or holder of the invalidated permit fails to remove the structure and clean the property within 30 days of the invalidation date, then the building official may take the necessary action to have the structure removed and have the property cleaned with all costs assessed against the property owner and if unpaid for 30 days shall be assessed as a lien against the property. Failure to comply with this section may require referring this matter to the Code Compliance Board to assess fines or other corrective actions. 
Standard criteria that may be applied when extending or reinstating an expired permit or when preparing a construction management plan for any building project: 
1.  Limitation of noise: In addition to the specific prohibitions of noise from construction activities in Section 62-97 of Chapter 62, Article II "Noise and Disturbance Control," construction activity noise may be limited to week days between the hours of 8AM and 5PM. 
2.  Limitation of site cleanliness and storage of materials: In addition to the requirements addressing construction debris in Section 105.24, cleanup of debris and discarded construction material may be required every 7 days; and storage of building material not in use may be limited to a storage period of 30 days or less. 
3.  Limitation of work hours to 8AM to 5PM, Monday through Friday, in addition to prohibition of work on holidays. 
4.  Parking of all vehicles, trailer(s) and equipment related to the construction project is limited to onsite parking or parking on a remote non-residentially zoned site. 
105.4.1.4 With respect to commercial or multifamily building projects, construction activity which has commenced under a valid building permit shall proceed without stoppages of work exceeding ninety (90) days or ninety (90) days after the last inspection after which the building permit may be revoked and become void and the project shall be deemed an inactive construction site for the purpose of this Section. The licensed contractor and/or property owner shall maintain all construction sites in a safe condition and shall provide fencing or other protective barriers if needed for security and safety on active or inactive construction sites. All building sites shall be kept clean so as to minimize unsafe or hazardous conditions and unsightly appearance. Active construction sites shall be protected as directed by the Florida Building Code and the building official. When extending or reinstating a non-residential or multifamily residential permit the building official may impose additional conditions to limit noise, storage of materials or debris, cleanliness of the building site, work hours, construction worker parking or take other actions that will minimize the negative impact of an active construction project for surrounding properties. 
For inactive construction sites the licensed contractor or owner shall remove any silt fencing unless deemed necessary to protect adjacent public or private property from soil erosion or adverse drainage. During the first twelve (12) months after a construction project has become an inactive construction site the licensed contractor or owner shall comply with one of the following actions: 
1)  Paint unfinished surfaces of uncompleted structure(s) with muted or approved paint color and remove construction fencing or set back exterior fencing and cover with a black or muted color screen cover at least ten (10) feet (or approved distance) from all property lines abutting public streets. Provide an approved landscape barrier, sod or other approved surface: such as, but not limited to, mulch within the approved set back area. The approved landscape barrier or sod must be irrigated and maintained in good condition until the project can proceed with active construction. All buildings must be secured in an aesthetic manner to prevent entry in accordance with Section 22-177(108.9) where boarding up openings are used. All construction debris must be removed from the site and overgrowth of grass, weeds and vegetative growth must be mowed regularly to comply with Section 22-177 (302.4) of the Winter Park Code; or 
2)  Remove all incomplete structures (exclusive of the principal building(s) under construction); remove unused materials or store inside incomplete building or place out of view from the surrounding lot lines and maintain the property free of debris and overgrowth in accordance with Section 22-177 (302.4) of the Winter Park Code; or 
3)  Provide a written plan and completion time line outlining proposed measures to be taken to maintain the construction site in a safe and aesthetic manner until construction of the project can proceed. The plan must be reviewed and approved by the building official. 
In addition to the above required actions for an inactive construction site, after twelve (12) months, at the discretion of the Building Official based on safety concerns, all temporary or non-permitted fencing must be removed and the property shall be maintained free of overgrowth in accordance with Section 22-177 (302.4) of the Winter Park Code. 
Upon a determination by the building official that the subject project is not in compliance with this section, the licensed contractor or property owner may appeal the building official's decision to the Construction Board of Adjustments and Appeals to affirm or to amend and modify the decision of the building official. Failure to comply with any of these actions will result in the Building Official referring the matter to the Code Compliance Board. If the Code Compliance Board finds a serious threat to public health, safety and welfare, the Code Compliance Board may recommend reasonable repairs to bring the property into compliance and charge the violator with the reasonable cost of the repairs along with a fine, as provided for in Section 162.09, Florida Statutes. 
Active construction sites shall be protected as directed by the Florida Building Code and the building official. 
105.4.1.5 In addition to any stricter provisions listed in 104.3 for revoking or voiding a permit, failure to obtain an approved inspection within 180 days of the previous approved inspection shall constitute suspension or abandonment of the permit. One or more extensions of time, for periods not more than 180 days each, may be allowed by the building official for the permit, provided the extension is requested in writing and justifiable cause is demonstrated prior to the expiration date. The building official shall record the extension of time granted. 
105.4.1.6 For good cause shown, in order to keep the permit valid, the building official may grant one or more extensions of time for periods not exceeding 90 days each. Requests for extensions shall be in writing and addressed to the building official, shall state the basis for the request, and shall be filed prior to the expiration of the permit period or any extension thereof previously granted. Such extensions as may be granted shall be in writing by the building official. 
105.4.1.7 Good cause for an extension shall include, but not be limited to, the following circumstances beyond the control of the permit holder: 
(1)  Acts of God and other natural disasters. 
(2)  Material shortages. 
(3)  Interruptions due to strikes or other employee job actions. 
(4)  Fire, explosion, or some similar catastrophe. 
(5)  Financial reversals of a temporary nature. 
(6)  Other situations beyond the control of the permit holder. 
105.4.1.8 The building official is authorized to reject new permit applications from a contractor who holds expired permits or inactive permits not resolved to comply with the building code or other applicable codes as determined by the building official. For the purposes of this subsection, a closed permit shall mean a permit for which all requirements for completion have been satisfied or a permit that has been administratively closed by the building official. An open permit shall mean a permit that has not satisfied all requirements for completion under conditions of the permit as determined by the building official. The building official is authorized to administratively close expired or inactive trade permits after 6 years based upon expiration when no known safety hazard exists and no code violations have been previously identified. 
Section 105.5 and 105.5.3 is added to read as follows: 
105.5 Construction Site Management Plan (referenced hereafter as "Management Plan"). The building official may require a detailed management plan and completion schedule prior to the approval of a building permit or during the process of completing any active or inactive construction or demolition project. The management plan shall, at a minimum, provide specific information outlining the location of construction worker parking, construction equipment, material storage and temporary structures on the site under construction or on nearby properties, and methods of debris removal including compliance with the city's waste franchise agreement. Additionally, traffic routes to and from the site, pedestrian safety barriers and fencing shall be included on the management plan and shall be identified for approval. The management plan must also reflect where displaced public or private parking is temporarily located during the term of the project to the maximum extent feasible. The plan is subject to review and approval by the building official. Failure to comply with the approved management plan shall result in the placement of a "stop work" order as outlined in Section 115, the issuance of a citation, by referring the violation to be heard by the Code Compliance Board or any other remedy provided at law. The approved management plan must be kept at the construction site and be available at all times during the construction process and be made available to the building official or city inspectors. 
105.5.3 Closing out or resolving open or expired permits shall be the responsibility of the permit applicant and the property owner. Failure to close out or resolve open permits may be reported to the proper authority by the building official. 
Section 105.18 is added to read as follows: 
105.18 Temporary toilet facilities for workers. Suitable temporary toilet facilities as determined by the building official in reliance upon normal industry standards shall be provided and maintained in a sanitary condition for the use of workers during construction. Such facilities shall be regularly cleaned and provided in a well-ventilated location and shall be placed at least 15 feet from the side property line of the lot on which it is located where practical, may not be placed in the public right-of-way and shall be screened from view when required. The location of temporary toilet facilities on the property may be changed by the building official to recognize unique conditions or a less offensive location for neighbors. 
Section 105.19 is added to read as follows: 
105.19 Work commencing before permit issuance. Any person who commences any work on a building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system before obtaining the building official's approval or the necessary permits shall be subject to a penalty of triple the basic permit fee. This provision does not apply if the building official determines that due to emergency work a delay would clearly have placed life or property in imminent danger. The payment of a triple fee shall not preclude or be deemed a substitute for prosecution for commencing work without first obtaining a permit. The building official may grant extensions of time or waive fees when justifiable cause has been demonstrated in writing. 
Sections 105.20 to 105.27 are added to read as follows: 
105.20 Building permit valuations. If, in the opinion of the building official, the valuation of building, alteration, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing systems appears to be underestimated on the application, the permit shall be denied unless the applicant can show detailed estimates to meet the approval of the building official. Permit valuations shall include total cost, such as electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing equipment and other systems, including design costs, materials and labor. The permit valuation may be calculated using the latest Building Valuation Data published by the International Code Council or other current valuation data available at the option of the building official or by using the actual contract amount for the construction improvement with the higher amount used for the permit valuation. 
The following Section 105.21 replaces Section 109: 
105.21.1 Permit fees. On all buildings, structures, electrical, plumbing, mechanical and gas systems or alterations requiring a permit, a plan review fee for each permit shall be paid as required at the time of applying for the permit, and a fee shall be paid as required at the time of obtaining the permit in accordance with the schedule as established by the city commission of the city as set forth in its schedule of fees. The established permit and plan review fee shall include the costs of services for enforcing the land development code and other municipal or regulatory requirements by city departments involved in plan review, inspection, and preliminary consultation for a project and administration of the land development code. The amount of refunds for any building permit, including single-family dwellings, shall be determined by deducting the cost of all city services including but not limited to plan review fees. When one year has elapsed from the time of issuance of a permit, no refunds shall be processed. No new permit shall be issued to a building permit applicant who has outstanding unpaid fees from any previous permit issued to said applicant, including but not limited to re-inspection fees, impact fees, or "stop work order" charges or who has outstanding permits which have not received either final inspection approval or a release on abandoned projects after more than six months of inactivity except for extenuating circumstances such as good cause as delineated under Section 105.4.1.7. 
105.21.2 Electronic filing of permit documents. After all applicable city departments have reviewed and approved submitted permit documents and plans filed as part of an application for a building permit, and after all required corrections are made to the submitted permit documents and plans, prior to final issuance of the approved permit.

302.10 Shrubs, hedges and trees obstructing visibility at intersections. Shrubs, hedges, trees or plantings shall be kept trimmed so that the visibility for motor vehicle drivers is not obstructed at street intersections and points of ingress and egress to the public right-of-way. Where shrubs, hedges, trees or plantings are not kept so trimmed, in addition to any other penalties provided for in this code, the city may, after notice to the property owner responsible for such violation, enter upon the property where such violation is taking place and cut and trim the hedges or plantings, which are causing such violation to be reduced to a height of 21/2 feet above the street curb elevation or cut tree limbs to a height of eight feet above the curb or sidewalk and upon performing such labor may bill the property owner for the actual cost thereof. Shrubs, trees and other vegetation which extend into the public right-of-way, and obstruct visibility at street intersections and points of ingress and egress to the public right-of-way or over hang the sidewalk obstructing pedestrian travel may be cut or trimmed by the city in accordance with the above referenced specifications after providing a 24-hour notice by placing such notice on the door of the abutting dwelling or business or by hand delivery to the occupant of the dwelling or business in order to provide for the public safety.

Sec. 22-226. - Intent and purpose. 
    The purpose of this article shall be to require the clear display of building numbers that shall be visible from public streets for all properties that contain principal buildings within the city in order to assist the general public or the authorities in identifying any property in case of an emergency, as well as for the welfare of the general public in conducting their normal affairs. 
(Code 1960, § 8-11) 
Sec. 22-227. - Applicability. 
    All dwelling houses, stores or other buildings erected within the city shall display at least one set of building numbers which shall be assigned by the building official. 
(Code 1960, § 8-12) 
Sec. 22-228. - Specifications. 
    In order to comply with this article, building numbers shall be Arabic numerals, unless otherwise approved by the building official. Other types of numbers shall be approved unless they are so decorative as to be difficult to read. In addition, numbers shall have a minimum height of three inches and shall be mounted in a secure fashion to the building's front wall or to a porch or other fixed appurtenance in front of the building in the general vicinity of the main entryway or main path of travel which leads to the main entrance from a public street or shall be otherwise separately mounted in an approved manner upon the face of a wall or upon a post in the front yard of the premises. Building numbers shall be mounted at a height between four feet and ten feet above the ground. They shall be sufficiently legible as to contrasting background, arrangement, spacing, size and uniformity of integers so that the numbers may be read with ease during daylight hours by a person possessing at least 20/40 vision viewing the numbers from the centerline of the abutting street opposite those points where regularly used pedestrian or vehicular accessways enter the public roadway. The numbers shall be so placed that trees, shrubs and other obstructions do not block the line of sight of the numbers from the center of the street to any appreciable degree. Where two or more nonresidential buildings back up to any public alley or private accessway, the building number shall also be displayed at the rear of the buildings in the same manner as in the front.

    Installations existing on the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived which essentially meet the requirements or spirit of this article in that the building number is displayed in a manner and location so that it can be read with ease from the street, including numbers presently on or attached to a mailbox, shall be granted approval by the building official without further alteration. 
(Code 1960, § 8-14) 
Sec. 22-230. - Tampering with building number displays prohibited. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person to remove, obliterate, deface or otherwise render useless for the purpose of identification any building number displayed within the city. 
(Code 1960, § 8-15) 
Sec. 22-231. - Enforcement; appeals; violations. 
(a)  Notice of nonconformance. If numbers do not conform to the requirements established by this article, a notice shall be forwarded to the owner and occupant of the building informing the owner of the proper number and directing him to properly post the number in accordance with this article within 60 days. A copy of the notice shall be kept on file in the department of planning and community development. The notice will include the person notified, type of violation and date of notice. 
(b)  New buildings. A certificate of occupancy shall not be issued for any building erected or located in the city until the building official has verified that the building number required is displayed in accordance with this article. 
(c)  Appeals. If any owner or occupant shall feel aggrieved by any determination or demand made under this article, the owner or occupant shall have the right to an administrative review of such determination or demand based upon undue financial difficulty, gross inconvenience or other specific problems related to this article. In order to exercise this right, the owner or occupant, within 30 days following receipt of the notice containing the determination or demand shall send a written notice to the building official requesting that the city manager review such determination or demand. The city manager shall review such determination or demand within 30 days and shall come to a determination. The owner or occupant shall comply with the determination of the city manager unless, within 15 days after such determination, the owner or occupant files a request for review by the city commission. The city commission shall schedule a hearing thereon within 30 days following receipt of such notice and shall notify the building official and the owner or occupant of the date and time of the hearing and shall permit them to present evidence and argument thereat. After such hearing the city commission shall come to a determination on such matter, and such determination shall be the final position of the city. So long as the owner or occupant shall comply with the administrative review procedures in this subsection in a timely fashion, his good faith failure to comply with a notice of violation shall not constitute a violation of this article.

    The city finds that the development of cable television and communications systems has the potential of having great benefit and impact upon the residents of the city. Because of the complex and rapidly changing technology associated with cable television, the city further finds that the public convenience, safety and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers which should be vested in the city or such persons as the city shall designate. It is the intent of this chapter and amendments to provide for and specify the means to attain the best possible public interest and public purpose in these matters and any franchise issued pursuant to this chapter shall be deemed to include this finding as an integral part thereof.

Neither the existence of other remedies identified in this chapter nor the exercise thereof shall be deemed to bar or otherwise limit the right of the city to recover fines, penalties or monetary damages (except where liquidated damages are otherwise prescribed) for such violation by the grantee or judicial enforcement of the grantee's obligations by means of specific performance, injunction relief or mandate or any other administrative remedy or judicial remedy at law or in equity.

(b)  If the grantor shall grant to a grantee a nonexclusive, revocable franchise to construct, operate, maintain and reconstruct a cable communications system within the franchise area or a renewal of an existing franchise, the franchise shall constitute both a right and an obligation to provide the services of a cable communications system as required by this chapter and the franchise agreement. The franchise agreement shall include those provisions of the grantee's application for franchise that are finally negotiated and accepted by the grantor and grantee. Any franchise granted under the terms and conditions contained in this article shall be consistent with federal laws and regulations and state general laws and regulations. If a conflict occurs in the terms and conditions of the franchise and the terms and conditions on which the grantor can grant a franchise, the general law or statutory requirements shall, without exception, control. Any franchise granted is made subject to the general ordinance provisions in effect in the proper exercise of the grantor's police power. Nothing in the franchise shall be deemed to waive the requirements of the other codes and ordinances of the grantor regarding permits, fees to be paid or the manner of construction. 
(c)  Neither this chapter as a whole, nor any of its parts, portions or terms, shall be construed as granting or intending to grant to a grantee a franchise to use the city's public ways or other public places of the city or any portion of the system for communication services not related to cable television, including, but not limited to, telephone and data communication services, or any other uses not specified herein; but nothing herein shall preclude a grantee from entering into a contract for the use of any portion of the system with any person, firm, partnership or corporation; provided that such person, firm, partnership, or corporation first obtains any required franchise from the city and any required certification from the state.

(Code 1960, § 8A-6(4)) 
Sec. 30-34. - Franchise nonexclusive. 
    Any cable communications franchise granted shall be nonexclusive. The grantor specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional franchises for a cable communications system as it deems appropriate; provided, however, that such additional grants shall not operate to materially modify, revoke or terminate any rights previously granted to any grantee, except that in the event any of the material terms and conditions of any cable communications franchise granted to any other party is (are) more favorable (by inclusion, exclusion, or altering of such material provisions) to such other party than the corresponding terms and conditions of an existing franchise, then the existing franchise shall be amended to include such more favorable terms and conditions.

The grantee expressly agrees that upon the grantee's acceptance of the franchise the grantee does so relying upon the grantee's own investigation and understanding of the power and authority of the city to grant the franchise. 
(b)  The grantee, by accepting the franchise, acknowledges that the grantee has not been induced to accept the franchise by any promise, verbal or written, by or on behalf of the city or by any third person regarding the franchise not expressed therein.

(Code 1960, § 8A-35; Ord. No. 2287, § 1, 10-27-98) 
Sec. 30-43. - Amount and payment of fees.

The fee may be subject to adjustment and increase by the city at such time as applicable laws and regulations permit. The city shall not require a franchise fee greater than five percent of gross revenues to the extent that the fee has a substantial detrimental effect upon the economic feasibility of the grantee's cable communications system. The grantee shall be entitled to adjust rates to recover from subscribers and users any increase in the franchise fee adopted by the city pursuant to this section to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations; alternatively, the grantee shall be required to adjust rates to reflect the decrease in costs associated with any reduction in the franchise fee adopted by the city to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations. 
(b)  The fees shall be paid monthly within 30 days of the end of each month during the term of the franchise. Not later than the date of each payment, each grantee shall file with the city clerk a written statement signed under penalty of perjury by an officer of the grantee which identifies in detail the sources and amounts of gross revenues received by a grantee during the month for which payment is made. 
(c)  No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is, in fact, the correct amount nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim which the city may have for further or additional sums payable under the provisions of this section. 
(d)  Any transaction or arrangement which has the effect of circumventing payment of required franchise fees and/or evasion of payment of franchise fees by non-collection, non-reporting of gross revenue, collection of gross revenues by affiliates, bartering, or any other means which evade the actual collection of gross revenues by a grantee for services delivered over the system is prohibited.

No such consent shall be required for a mortgage or other hypothecation as a whole or in part to secure an indebtedness. 
(b)  The proposed assignee must show technical ability, financial capability, legal qualifications and general character qualifications as determined by the city and must agree to comply with all provisions of the franchise and such conditions as may be prescribed by the city commission.

The word "control" as used in this subsection is not limited to major stockholders but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. Every change, transfer or acquisition of control of the grantee shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the city shall have consented thereto. For the purpose of determining whether the city shall consent to such change, transfer or acquisition of control, the city may inquire into the qualifications of the prospective controlling party and the grantee shall assist the city in any such inquiry. 
(d)  A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or accumulation by any person or group of persons of ten percent of the voting interest of the grantee, except where a single person who has been approved to control the grantee retains more than 50 percent of the voting interest of the grantee. 
(e)  The consent or approval of the city commission to any transfer of the franchise shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the city in and to the streets, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subordinate to the terms and conditions of a franchise. 
(f)  In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the city will not approve any transfer or assignment of a franchise prior to substantial completion of construction of the proposed system.

(Ord. 2023, § 1, 11-9-93) 
Sec. 30-122. - Initial review of basic cable rates. 
(a)  Notice. Upon adoption of this article and the certification of the city by the FCC, the city shall immediately notify the grantee, by certified mail, return receipt requested, that the city intends to regulate subscriber rates charged for the basic service tier and associated equipment as authorized by the Cable Act of 1992. 
(b)  Grantee response. Within 30 days of receiving notice from the city, the grantee shall file with the city its current rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment and any supporting material concerning the reasonableness of its rates. 
(c)  Expedited determination and public hearing. 
(1)  If the city commission is able to expeditiously determine that the grantee's rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable benchmark, the city commission shall: 
a.  Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express their views; and 
b.  Act to approve the rates within 30 days from the date of grantee filled its basic cable rates with the city. 
(2)  If the city commission takes no action within 30 days from the date the grantee filed its basic cable rates with the city, the proposed rates will continue in effect. 
(d)  Extended review period. 
(1)  If the city commission is unable to determine whether the rates in issue are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the material before it, or if the grantee submits a cost-of-service showing, the city commission shall, within 30 days from the date the grantee filed its basic cable rates with the city and by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination: 
a.  Ninety days if the city commission needs more time to ensure that a rate is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard; or 
b.  One hundred fifty days if the grantee has submitted a cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate above the applicable benchmark. 
(2)  If the city commission has not made a decision within the 90- or 150-day period, the city commission shall issue a brief written order at the end of the period requesting the grantee to keep accurate account of all amounts received by reason of the proposed rate and on whose behalf the amounts are paid. 
(e)  Public hearing. During the extended review period and before taking action on the proposed rate, the city commission shall hold at least one public hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record objections. 
(f)  Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to the proposed initial basic rate may request the city clerk to record the objection during the public hearing or may submit the objection in writing any time before the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be made part of the record, the objector must provide the city clerk with the objector's name and address. 
(g)  Benchmark analysis. If the grantee submits its current basic cable rate schedule as being in compliance with the FCC's reasonable rate standard, the city commission shall review the rates using the benchmark analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the city commission's findings, the initial basic cable rates shall be established as follows: 
(1)  If the current basic cable rates are below the benchmark, those rates shall become the initial basic cable rates and the grantee's rates will be capped at that level. 
(2)  If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, the rates shall be the greater of the grantee's per channel rate on September 30, 1992, reduced by ten percent, or the applicable benchmark, adjusted for inflation and any change in the number of channels occurring between September 30, 1992, and the initial date of regulation. 
(3)  If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, but the grantee's per channel rate was below the benchmark on September 30, 1992, the initial basic cable rate shall be the benchmark, adjusted for inflation. 
(h)  Cost-in-service showings. If the grantee does not wish to reduce the rates to the permitted level, the grantee shall have the opportunity to submit a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify initial basic cable rates above the FCC's reasonable rate standard. The city commission will review a cost-of-service submission pursuant to FCC standards for cost-of-service review. The city commission may approve initial basic cable rates above the benchmark if the grantee makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting in rates below the benchmark or below the grantee's September 30, 1992, rates minus ten percent, will prescribe the grantee's new rates. 
(i)  Decision. 
(1)  By formal resolution. After completion of its review of the grantee's proposed rates, the city commission shall adopt its decision by formal resolution. The decision shall include one of the following: 
a.  If the proposal is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or is justified by a cost-of-service analysis, the city commission shall approve the initial basic cable rates proposed by the grantee; or 
b.  If the proposal is not within the FCC's reasonable rate standard and the cost-of-service analysis, if any, does not justify the proposed rates, the city commission shall establish initial basic cable rates that are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a cost-of-service analysis. 
(2)  Rollbacks and refunds. If the city commission determines that the initial basic cable rates as submitted exceed the reasonable rate standard or that the grantee's cost-of-service showing justifies lower rates, the city commission may order the rates reduced in accordance with subsection (g) or (h) above, as applicable. In addition, the city commission may order the grantee to pay to subscribers refunds of the excessive portion of the rates with interest (computed at applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue Service for tax refunds and additional tax payments), retroactive to September 1, 1993. The method of paying any refund and the interest rate will be in accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the city commission's decision resolution. 
(3)  Statement of reasons for decision and public notice. If rates proposed by a grantee are disapproved in whole or in part, or if there were objections made by other parties to the proposed rates, the resolution must state the reasons for the decision and the city commission must give public notice of its decision. Public notice will be given by advertisement once in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. 
(j)  Appeal. The city commission's decision concerning rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment, may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with applicable federal regulations.

If the city commission is unable to make a final determination concerning a requested rate increase within the extended time period, the grantee may put the increase into effect, subject to subsequent refund if the city commission later issues a decision disapproving any portion of the increase. 
(g)  Price cap analysis. If a grantee presents its request for a rate increase as being in compliance with the FCC's price cap, the city commission shall review the rate using the price cap analysis in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the city commission's findings, the basic cable rates shall be established as follows: 
(1)  If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the price cap established by the FCC, the proposed rates shall become the new basic cable rates. 
(2)  If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the price cap established by the FCC, the city commission shall disapprove the proposed rate increase and order an increase that is in compliance with the price cap. 
(h)  Cost-of-service showings. If a grantee submits a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify a rate increase above the price cap, the city commission will review the submission pursuant to FCC standards for cost-of-service review. The city commission may approve a rate increase above the price cap if the grantee makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-of-service determination resulting in a rate below the price cap or below the grantee's then current rate will prescribe the grantee's new rate. 
(i)  Decision. The city commission's decision concerning the requested rate increase shall be adopted by formal resolution. If a rate increase proposed by a grantee is disapproved in whole or in part, or if objections were made by other parties to the proposed rate increase, the resolution must state the reasons for the decision. Objections may be made at the public hearing by a person requesting the city clerk to record the objection or may be submitted in writing at any time before the decision resolution is adopted. 
(j)  Refunds. 
(1)  The city commission may order refunds of subscribers' rate payments with interest if: 
a.  The city commission was unable to make a decision within the extended time period as described in subsection (c) above; and 
b.  The grantee implemented the rate increase at the end of the extended review period; and 
c.  The city commission determines that the rate increase as submitted exceeds the applicable price cap or that the grantee failed to justify the rate increase by a cost-of-service showing, and the city commission disapproves any portion of the rate increase. 
(2)  The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the city commission's decision resolution. 
(k)  Appeal. The city commission's decision concerning rates for the basic service tier or associated equipment may be appealed to the FCC in accordance with applicable federal regulations. 
(Ord. 2023, § 1, 11-9-93) 
Sec. 30-124. - Grantee information. 
(a)  City may require. 
(1)  In those cases when the grantee has submitted initial rates or proposed an increase that exceeds the reasonable rate standard, the city commission may require the grantee to produce information in addition to that submitted, including proprietary information, if needed to make a rate determination. In these cases, a grantee may request the information be kept confidential in accordance with this section. 
(2)  In cases where initial or proposed rates comply with the reasonable rate standard, the city commission may request additional information only in order to document that the grantee's rates are in accord with the standard. 
(b)  Request for confidentiality. 
(1)  A grantee submitting information to the city commission may request in writing that the information not be made routinely available for public inspection. A copy of the request shall be attached to and cover all of the information and all copies of the information to which it applies. 
(2)  If feasible, the information to which the request applies shall be physically separated from any information to which the request does not apply. If this is not feasible, the portion of the information to which the request applies shall be identified. 
(3)  Each request shall contain a statement of the reasons for withholding inspection and a statement of the facts upon which those reasons are based. 
(4)  Casual requests which do not comply with the requirements of this subsection shall not be considered. 
(c)  City commission action. Requests which comply with the requirements of subsection (b) will be acted upon by the city commission. The city commission will grant the request if the grantee presents by a preponderance of the evidence, a case for nondisclosure consistent with applicable federal regulations. If the request is granted, the ruling will be placed in a public file in lieu of the information withheld from public inspection. If the request does not present a case for nondisclosure and the city commission denies the request, the city commission shall take one of the following actions: 
(1)  If the information has been submitted voluntarily without any direction from the city, the grantee may request that the city return the information without considering it. Ordinarily, the city will comply with this request. Only in the unusual instance that the public interest so requires, will the information be made available for public inspection. 
(2)  If the information was required to be submitted by the city commission, the information will be made available for public inspection. 
(d)  Appeal. If the city commission denies the request for confidentiality, the grantee may seek review of that decision from the FCC within five working days of the city commission's decision, and the release of the information will be stayed pending review. 
(Ord. 2023, § 1, 11-9-93) 
Sec. 30-125. - Automatic rate adjustments. 
(a)  Annual inflation adjustment. In accordance with FCC regulations, the grantee may adjust its capped base per channel rate for the basic service tier annually by the final GNP-PI index. 
(b)  Other external costs. 
(1)  The FCC regulations also allow the grantee to increase its rate for the basic service tier automatically to reflect certain external cost factors to the extent that the increase in cost of those factors exceeds the GNP-PI. These factors include retransmission consent fees, programming costs, state and local taxes applicable to the provision of cable television service, and costs of complying with franchise requirements. The total cost of an increase in a franchise fee may be automatically added to the base per channel rate, without regard to its relation to the GNP-PI. 
(2)  For all categories of external costs other than retransmission consent and franchise fees, the starting date for measuring changes in external costs for which the basic service per channel rate may be adjusted will be the date on which the basic service tier becomes subject to regulation or February 28, 1994, whichever occurs first. The permitted per channel charge may not be adjusted for costs of retransmission consent fees or changes in those fees incurred before October 6, 1994. 
(c)  Notification and review. The grantee shall notify the city at least 30 days in advance of a rate increase based on automatic adjustment items. The city shall review the increase to determine whether the item or items qualify as automatic adjustments. If the city makes no objection within 30 days of receiving notice of the increase, the increase may go into effect. 
(Ord. 2023, § 1, 11-9-93) 
Sec. 30-126. - Enforcement. 
(a)  Refunds. The city may order the grantee to refund the subscribers a portion of previously paid rates under the following circumstances: 
(1)  A portion of the previously paid rates have been determined to be in excess of the permitted tier charge or above the actual cost of equipment; or 
(2)  The grantee has failed to comply with a valid rate order issued by the city. 
(b)  Fines. If the grantee fails to comply with a rate decision or refund order, the grantee shall be subject to a fine of $500.00 for each day the grantee fails to comply.

Sec. 34-26. - Penalty. 
    Any person who shall violate the provisions of this article or the regulations duly adopted pursuant to this article shall, upon conviction, be punished as provided in section 1-7 of this Code. 
(Code 1960, § 8B-8) 
Sec. 34-27. - Regulations governing operation. 
    The operation of cemeteries shall be pursuant to regulations which, when adopted by the city commission, shall have the force and effect of law. Copies of such regulations shall be at all times kept on file in the office of the city clerk. Regulations may be modified and amended from time to time by the city commission at any regular or special meeting as the city commission shall see fit. 
(Code 1960, § 8B-3) 
Sec. 34-28. - Palm Cemetery and Pineywood Cemetery-Declared public cemeteries of city. 
    Palm Cemetery, as per the plat thereof recorded in plat book Y, page 81, public records of the county, and Pineywood Cemetery, as per the plat thereof recorded in plat book C, page 35, public records of the county, are declared to be the public cemeteries of the city. Official maps of the cemeteries setting forth lots and blocks shall at all times be kept on file at the office of the superintendent of cemeteries. 
(Code 1960, § 8B-1) 
Sec. 34-29. - Same-Perpetual care cemeteries. 
    Palm Cemetery and Pineywood Cemetery are declared perpetual care cemeteries and shall be maintained and cared for as such by the city. 
(Code 1960, § 8B-2) 
Sec. 34-30. - Title and ownership of lots and spaces. 
(a)  Title and ownership of cemetery spaces, lots or blocks shall be evidenced by deeds executed by the mayor or city manager and attested to by the city clerk with the seal of the city affixed. The burial rights conveyed by the city may, depending upon the express language used in an approved form of deed or other document of conveyance, consist only of a right to burial but shall not consist of fee title ownership in the real property comprising a specific plot or burial space. 
(b)  Title shall be subject to the cemetery regulations and to the ordinances of the city as such may from time to time be modified or amended. 
(c)  A record of deeds shall at all times be maintained in the office of the city clerk. 
(d)  Abandonment of burial rights. There is a presumption that burial rights in any cemetery of the City of Winter Park shall be abandoned and that the city shall thereafter regain all title and rights previously conveyed when an owner of unused burial rights has failed to provide the City of Winter Park or its cemetery with a current residence address for a period of 50 consecutive years, the burial rights are unused for such period of time, and the cemetery is therefore unable to communicate by certified letter with said owner regarding the lack of address. However, in all such cases of abandonment the following procedures shall be followed: 
(1)  Before the city retakes ownership of such rights for reason of abandonment, a certified letter shall be sent to any lineal relative of the owner, if the city has knowledge of the lineal descendant and his or her address. Additionally, the city shall send a certified letter to any person who holds the burial rights in common ownership or any lineal descendant, if known, of such person. In the certified letter, if one may be sent to a known address and known lineal descendant, the cemetery shall set forth the fact that the burial rights shall be deemed abandoned unless the person contacts the designated representative of the city and its cemetery with proof of ownership and intent concerning use of the burial rights. 
If a lineal descendant timely contacts in writing the designated representative of the city, then the burial rights shall not be deemed abandoned if such person is able to establish an ownership interest and an intent for a lineal descendant to use the burial rights. 
(2)  The city or its designated representative shall cause to be published one time in a newspaper of general circulation in Orange County the fact that burial rights will be deemed abandoned unless, within 30 days from the date of advertisement, a lineal descendant shall contact the designated city official in writing and establish his or her legal right to the burial rights that will otherwise be abandoned. 
    If no response is timely received or if a response is inadequate to prove the interest, the ownership or burial rights shall be deemed abandoned and available for resale by the City of Winter Park in accordance with the then existing fee schedule. 
    In order to better conserve this precious and limited asset of the City of Winter Park, it shall be necessary for all owners of burial rights to either use the rights within 50 years from the date of acquisition of such rights, or through themselves or a lineal descendant provide notice prior to the expiration of 50 years from date of acquisition of the rights of the then current residence address and identity of the person or persons then entitled to use such burial rights, who may be either the original purchaser or a lineal descendant thereof. 
    The city will honor a person's right other than a lineal descendant if the person who acquired the original burial rights has bequeathed the right to another and the city is provided a certified copy of a court order conferring the transference of such burial rights. 
(Code 1960, § 8B-6; Ord. No. 2471, § 1, 7-9-02; Ord. No. 2940-13, §§ 2, 3, 10-14-13) 
Sec. 34-31. - Perpetual care fund. 
    There is hereby established a cemetery fund into which the proceeds from the sale of cemetery lots and columbarium niches shall be placed to ensure the perpetual care and maintenance of the cemeteries. Funds placed in the cemetery fund prior to October 1, 1992, shall be invested and the income earned therefrom shall be accumulated or used exclusively to offset cemetery operating expenses. On October 1, 1992, and thereafter, all funds placed in the cemetery fund along with income earned therefrom may be used for cemetery related capital improvements approved by the city commission or to offset cemetery operating expenses.

    Franchise means the rights granted under this chapter by the city to a grantee by which the city authorizes such grantee to erect, construct, reconstruct, operate, dismantle, test, use and maintain a communications system in the city. Any franchise awarded by an ordinance in accordance herewith shall be a nonexclusive franchise.

Because of the complex and rapidly changing technology associated with fiber optic telecommunications, the city further finds that the public convenience, safety, and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers which should be vested in the city or such persons as the city shall designate. It is the intent of this chapter and amendments to provide for and specify the means to attain the best possible public interest and public purpose in these matters and any franchise issued pursuant to this chapter shall be deemed to include this finding as an integral part thereof.

In the event the maximum franchise fee authorized by the laws of the state shall be increased beyond the current amount of one percent of the gross receipts on recurring local service revenues as prescribed in F.S. § 337.401, the city shall be authorized to unilaterally amend this chapter and increase the franchise fee provided for herein to the maximum franchise fee authorized by the laws of the state; provided that the city increases the franchise fees for all communications system franchisees by an equal amount. Further, in the event the maximum franchise fee authorized by the laws of the state shall be decreased below the current amount of one percent or eliminated in its entirety, the city shall unilaterally amend this chapter and decrease or eliminate the franchise fee provided for herein to the maximum franchise fee authorized (if any) by the laws of the state, provided that the city decreases or eliminates the franchise fees for all communications system franchisees by an equal amount. 
(b)  The grantee, who provides communications services as defined in F.S. § 203.012(7), in consideration of the privilege granted under the franchise for the operation of such communications system within the public ways of the city and the expense of regulation pursuant to the franchise incurred by the city, shall pay to the city annually a sum equal to $500.00 per linear mile of any cable, fiber optic or other pathway that makes physical use of the city's right-of-way.

Acceptance of any franchise fee payment shall not be deemed a waiver or release of any claims the city may have for additional sums, nor be construed as an accord that the amount paid is correct. 
(d)  Within 30 calendar days after the close of each fiscal year, the grantee shall pay the franchise fee as provided in subsection (b) of this section and file with the city's finance director a statement, signed by an authorized accountant or financial representative of the grantee of the actual linear feet of any cable, fiber optic, or other pathway of the grantee making physical use of the city right-of-way.

In the event the reports are not made available to the city in the City of Winter Park, the grantee shall reimburse the city for the reasonable travel expense of the city's representative resulting from such representative's travel to the location where the reports are maintained and shall permit the city to make and remove copies from the reports, including computer printout or other data. Upon request by the city, or its designated representative, the grantee shall provide a copy of its annual report to the PSC and a copy of all telephone service reports required to be filed with the PSC. The city, or its designated representative, shall have the right during the term of this franchise to examine the reports; provided, however, that the grantee shall be obligated to maintain its billing records only for the period of time required by the PSC and that any examination conducted after such period shall be confined to the billing records then available. No later than 30 days after the request of the city, or its representative, the grantee shall supply to the city a copy of the reports. Such copy shall be in the media requested by the city provided that it is economical and practical for the grantee to do so; however, in no event shall paper copies of requested documentation be deemed uneconomical or impractical. The city agrees to keep all documentation and reports confidential, except as otherwise provided by state law.

The city manager may promulgate additional reasonable rules and regulations concerning the placement or maintenance of a communication facility in public rights-of-way consistent with this article and other applicable law. 
(k)  Requirements for wireless and communications facilities. Wireless and communications facilities may not be placed in the public rights-of-way unless it meets the following requirements: 
(1)  The aesthetic requirements and provisions under section 58-424 of this Code of Ordinances governing antennas and towers shall apply to wireless and communications facilities located within the right-of-way. 
(2)  Wireless and communications facilities must be concealed and utilize stealth design, as defined by section 40-83 of this article. Such stealth design and concealment shall eliminate the need to locate any ground or elevated equipment on the exterior of a pole, tower, or other structure. The city commission by resolution may adopt standards for the types or style of concealment and stealth design that are required within the city or parts thereof in order to preserve and promote the unique aesthetic character of the city. 
(3)  Any application or proposal to locate equipment at ground level on or adjacent to a pole or tower and any application or proposal to locate elevated equipment (other than antennas) on or adjacent to the exterior of a tower or pole that asserts that such cannot be accomplished by undergrounding such, and if not undergrounded then in accordance with the concealment and stealth design requirements of this article, may request an exemption to such requirements, and such application or proposal shall include Florida professional engineering certified documentation demonstrating to the satisfaction of the city engineer that the proposed equipment cannot employ stealth design and cannot be concealed as required by this article, and that the proposed equipment, and location and configuration of such, constitute the minimum equipment necessary and are the least obtrusive as is possible to achieve needed function. In order to avoid the clustering of multiple items of approved ground equipment or elevated equipment in a single area, only one equipment box may be located in any single location. Where a registrant demonstrates that undergrounding and stealth design and concealment cannot be employed under this subsection and the city agrees with such demonstration, the individual approved exterior equipment boxes or containment devices shall not exceed 12 cubic feet in volume and the configuration and dimensions of such shall be the least visually obtrusive as possible. The use of foliage and vegetation or other concealment method around any approved equipment may be required by the city based on conditions of the specific area where the equipment is to be located. 
(4)  Insofar as wireless facilities are constructed underground, the wireless infrastructure provider shall become a member of, and maintain membership in Florida utility notification one call system. Wireless facilities shall have five-foot horizontal clearance from other underground utilities and their appurtenances. 
(5)  Objective design standards. Wireless facilities shall meet the following reasonable location, context, color, stealth, and concealment requirements. Design standards may be waived by city if the city determines that the design standards are not reasonably compatible for the particular location of a wireless facility or that the design standards impose excessive expense in relation to the aesthetic concerns of the city. The waiver shall be granted or denied within 45 days after the date of the request. 
a.  Any above-ground wireless facilities shall meet stealth design requirements. 
b.  Wireless facilities may increase the height of a metal street light pole only if the antenna is top-mounted and not wider than the pole or if the antenna is hidden in a cylinder that appears like an original part of the pole. A cellular antenna shall not extend more than ten feet above the utility pole or structure upon which the wireless facility is to be collocated, and shall be shorter if the height of the utility pole requires a shorter antenna height so that the structure as a whole is proportionate. 
c.  A new utility pole that replaces an existing utility pole shall be of substantially similar design, material, and color as the existing utility pole unless the existing pole is made of wood, which is no longer permitted. 
d.  The antennas and related equipment shall be in a color that will provide the most camouflage, as determined by the building official. Ground-based wireless facilities shall be painted forest green, unless determined otherwise by the building official. When on a black pole, wireless facilities shall be painted black, unless determined otherwise by the building official. 
e.  Antennas must be hidden within the utility pole or appear like an original part of the utility pole. 
f.  All wireless facilities and related equipment, other than antennas, shall be placed underground in order, without limitation, to avoid impeding pedestrian travel, to avoid providing a target for graffiti or a mounting place for unauthorized signs, to minimize danger to the public, and to preserve and enhance the aesthetic qualities of the city. 
g.  Wires serving the wireless facilities must be concealed within or flush mounted to the pole on which the facilities are collocated and insulated in accordance with applicable codes. 
h.  The photographs attached as exhibits to this chapter provide conceptual examples of acceptable, acceptable with modifications, and prohibited wireless facilities. Because of rapid advances in stealth wireless technology and techniques, the city commission is authorized to identify by resolution other forms of acceptable wire facilities that are consistent and compatible with the aesthetic, safety, and other standards set forth in this chapter as well as prohibited wireless facilities. 
i.  Antennas placed upon structures within the rights-of-way must meet the following additional requirements if stealth design, concealment, and this article's requirements regarding such cannot be met: 
1.  Top-mounted antennas and their enclosures must not extend the diameter of the supporting structure at the level of antenna attachment; and 
2.  Side-mounted antennas and their enclosures must be flush mounted to the supporting structure at the level of antenna attachment. Under no circumstances shall antennas be mounted less than 12 feet above ground level. 
j.  Street light fixtures with stealth wireless facilities. 
1.  On street lights, luminaires and bases should be roughly equal in size and volume for a balanced appearance. 
2.  The decorative base of a street light should be between 10 to 25 percent of the pole height. 
3.  The length of arms extending from the base should be between 20 to 25 percent of pole height; 
4.  Arms should extend from the pole at a location within 20 percent of pole height from the top of the pole. 
5.  Street light fixtures must meet AASHTO structural guidelines for roadway application and ANSI requirements for vibrations. 
6.  Pole height shall be measured from the ground to the top of the utility pole, which measurement shall include any antennas built into or appended to the utility pole. 
k.  New or replacement poles that support wireless or communications facilities shall match the style, design, and color of the utility poles in the surrounding area. 
l.  The size and height of new wireless or communications facilities in the rights-of-way shall be no greater than the maximum size and height of any other utility or light poles located in the same portion of the right-of-way within the city other than a utility pole for which a waiver has previously been granted, measured from grade in place within 500 feet of the proposed location of the small wireless facility. If there is no utility pole within 500 feet, the height of the utility pole shall be limited to 50 feet, unless the city determines that a lower height is warranted given the location context for compatibility with existing or planned development within the vicinity of the proposed location or other provision of this article warrants such; provided however, that registrants proposing wireless or communications facilities with antennas to be located on existing poles or other structures may increase the height of the existing pole or other structure up to six feet, if necessary, to avoid adversely affecting existing pole attachments; and provided further that the overall height above ground of any wireless or communications facility shall not exceed 40 feet or exceed the existing height of other utility or light poles located in the same portion of the right-of-way, whichever height is less. 
(5)  Wireless and communications facilities shall be located at least ten feet from a driveway, at least ten feet from the edge of existing trees 12 inches or greater in diameter, at least 25 feet from a traffic signal pole unless mounted upon such traffic signal pole, and at least 15 feet from any pedestrian ramp and eight feet from the street curb. The city may require greater setbacks from these and other fixtures in the right-of-way to ensure proper sight lines for public safety purposes and in other cases as deemed necessary to advance the purposes of this article. 
(6)  If the right-of-way is within or abuts a residential zoning district, wireless communication facilities must be located where the shared property line between two residential parcels intersects the right-of-way, whenever possible unless an unsafe condition, cluttered appearance, or other violation of this article would result. 
(7)  If the right-of-way is within or abuts a nonresidential district, wireless facilities must be located between tenant spaces or adjoining properties where their shared property lines intersect the right-of-way, whenever possible, unless an unsafe condition, cluttered appearance, or other violation of this article would result. 
(8)  The city, in consultation with the city engineer where appropriate, may waive any requirement under this section if the city determines that such requirement is not reasonably compatible for the particular location of a small wireless facility or that such requirement imposes an excessive expense, or where the waiver serves the intent or purposes of this article. The waiver shall be granted or denied within 45 days after the date of the request. 
(l)  New structures; availability of alternatives. No new utility pole, pole-type structure, or other freestanding structure shall be allowed in the rights-of-way unless the applicant demonstrates and staff and the city commission determines that no existing structure or alternative technology that does not require the placement of a new structure in a right-of-way can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna or other communications facility. Such a demonstration by the applicant shall not give rise to a right to locate the proposed facility within the rights-of-way or in any way guarantee city approval of such. An applicant shall submit information requested by the city commission related to the availability of suitable existing structures or alternative technology. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing structure or alternative technology can accommodate the applicant's proposed communications facility may consist of, but is not limited to, the following factors to be considered by the city commission: 
(1)  No existing structures are located within the geographic area which would meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
(2)  Existing structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering requirements, which shall be demonstrated by, at minimum, propagation and coverage maps. 
(3)  Existing structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna or other communications facility and related equipment. 
(4)  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing structures, or the antenna on the existing structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
(5)  The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing structure or to adapt an existing structure for sharing are unreasonable. 
(6)  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing structures unsuitable. 
(7)  The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that does not require the use of new structures, such as cable microcell network using multiple low-powered transmitters/receivers attached to wireline system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new structure or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology unsuitable. 
(m)  Waivers and exemptions. The city commission may waive or reduce the burden of any requirement of this section where doing so serves the intent or purposes of this article. 
(n)  Limitations; no property right. A permit from the city constitutes authorization to undertake only certain activities in public rights-of-way in accordance with this article, and does not create a property right or grant authority to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way. 
(o)  Construction; maintenance; safety; inspection; and restoration. 
(1)  A registrant shall maintain its communication facility in public rights-of-way in a manner consistent with accepted industry practice and applicable law. 
(2)  All safety practices required by applicable law or accepted industry practices and standards shall be used during the construction, installation, or maintenance of communications facilities. 
(3)  After the completion of any placement or maintenance of a communication facility in public rights-of-way or each phase thereof, a registrant shall, at its own expense, restore the public rights-of-way to its original condition before such work. If the registrant fails to make such restoration within 30 days, or such longer period of time as may be reasonably required under the circumstances, following the completion of such placement or maintenance, the city may perform restoration and charge the costs of the restoration against the registrant in accordance with F.S. § 337.402, as it may be amended. For 12 months following the original completion of the work, the registrant shall guarantee its restoration work and shall correct any restoration work that does not satisfy the requirements of this article at its own expense. 
(4)  In connection with excavation in the public rights-of-way, a registrant shall, where applicable, comply with the Underground Facility Damage Prevention and Safety Act set forth in F.S. ch. 556, as it may be amended. 
(5)  Registrant shall use and exercise due caution, care and skill in performing work in the public rights-of-way and shall take all reasonable steps to safeguard work site areas. The person constructing, installing, and maintaining wireless facilities must be a licensed electrician, certified to work as a lineworker, or successfully complete an accredited lineworker apprenticeship program. 
(6)  A registrant shall not place or maintain its communications facilities so as to interfere with, displace, damage or destroy any utilities, including, but not limited to, sewers, gas or water mains, storm drains, pipes, cables or conduits of the city or any other person's facilities lawfully occupying the public rights-of-way of the city. 
(7)  The city shall have the right to make such inspections of communications facilities placed or maintained in public rights-of-way as it finds necessary to ensure compliance with this article. 
(p)  Modifications; antenna co-locations; removal and relocation. 
(1)  An application to modify a tower or base station that does not involve substantial change to the physical dimensions of such tower or base station, as provided in subsection 58-426(b)(1)a. of this Code of Ordinances, shall be governed by such subsection 58-426(b)(1)a. An application to co-locate an additional antenna(s) upon a tower or other structure involving minimal changes in physical dimensions, all as described in subsection 58-426(b)(1)b. of this City Code, shall be governed by such subsection 58-426(b)(1)b. An application to modify any communications facility or co-locate an antenna upon any structure within the rights-of-way not falling within subsection 58-426(b)(1)a. or 58-426(b)(1)b. shall be treated as an application for a new communications facility under this article, as appropriate. This subsection (k)(1) shall not govern applications to modify or co-locate antennas upon any structure or facility owned by the city. 
(2)  The grant of a permit under this article shall not limit the authority and discretion of the city to regulate and control the public rights-of-way, and the city may at any time require the removal or relocation of a communications facility within the rights-of-way in the interests of the public welfare, health, or safety, aesthetics or as otherwise authorized by law. The wireless facilities provider must remove its wireless facilities within 30 days notice that the city will remove a utility pole, including to replace a cobra street light with a decorative street light fixture. 
(3)  Removal or relocation at the direction of the city of a registrant's communications facility in public rights-of-way shall be governed by applicable requirements of F.S. §§ 337.403 and 337.404, as they may be amended, in addition to any other applicable city regulations or provisions of law. Unless otherwise provided by law, this City Code, or agreement, a registrant shall bear all costs of any removal or relocation of its facilities. 
(4)  Removal due to technology advances. The city may require removal of wireless facilities and utility poles no longer required or necessary to provide coverage or which provide redundant coverage due to advances in technology, including, without limitation, technological advances allowing larger distances between wireless facilities, or due to enhanced coverage provided under current technology. 
(q)  Coordination of work; work schedule. Upon request of the city, and as notified by the city of the other work, construction, installation or repairs referenced below, a registrant may be required to coordinate placement or maintenance activities under a permit with any other work, construction, installation or repairs that may be occurring or scheduled to occur within a reasonable time frame in the subject public rights-of-way, and registrant may be required to reasonably alter its placement or maintenance schedule as necessary so as to minimize disruptions and disturbance in the public rights-of-way. 
(r)  No warranties; vacation of rights-of-way. The city makes no warranties or representations regarding the fitness, suitability, or availability of the city's public rights-of-way, city-owned structures, and city-owned real property for the registrant's communications facilities and any performance of work, costs incurred or services provided by registrant shall be at registrant's sole risk. Nothing in this article shall affect the city's authority to add to, vacate or abandon public rights-of-way, or add vehicular travel lanes, and the city makes no warranties or representations regarding the availability of any added, vacated or abandoned public rights-of-way for communications facilities. 
(s)  Alteration of rights-of-way; other work and facilities in rights-of-way. 
(1)  The city reserves the right to place and maintain, and permit to be placed or maintained, sewer, gas, water, electric, storm drainage, communications, and other types of facilities, cables or conduit, and to do, and to permit to be done, any underground and overhead installation or improvement that may be deemed necessary or proper by the city in public rights-of-way occupied by the registrant. The city further reserves without limitation the right to alter, change, or cause to be changed, the grading, installation, relocation, or width of the public rights-of-way within the limits of the city and within said limits as same may from time to time be altered. 
(2)  A registrant shall, on the request of any person holding a permit issued by the city, temporarily raise or lower its wireless or other communications facilities to permit the work authorized by the permit. The expense of temporarily raising or lowering facilities shall be paid by the person requesting the same, and the registrant shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. The registrant shall be given not less than 30 days advance written notice to arrange for such temporary relocation. 
(3)  Replacement and maintenance of wireless facilities. The city shall not require approval or require fees or other charges for: 
a.  Routine maintenance; 
b.  Replacement of existing wireless facilities with wireless facilities that are substantially similar or of the same or smaller size; or 
c.  A communications service provider authorized to occupy the rights-of-way and who is remitting taxes under chapter 202. 
Notwithstanding this paragraph, for public safety, the wireless provider must give reasonable notice to the city's public works department before undertaking these activities and a right-of-way permit shall be required for work that involves excavation, closure of a sidewalk, or closure of a vehicular lane. 
(4)  The city may charge a pole connection fee for connecting to a city utility pole in a reasonable amount to be determined by Winter Park utilities. 
(t)  Additional authority; permit conditions. To the extent not otherwise prohibited by state or federal law and this chapter, the city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional communications facilities within all or parts of the public rights-of-way. The city may impose reasonable conditions upon the grant of a permit, in addition to the specific requirements of this Code, as deemed appropriate to advance the intent or purposes of this article. 
(u)  The approval of the installation, placement, maintenance, or operation of a small wireless facility or other wireless facility pursuant to this article does not authorize the installation, placement, maintenance, or operation of any communications facilities other than small wireless facilities in the right-of-way. 
(v)  Make-ready for collocation. 
(1)  For a city utility pole that does not support an aerial facility used to provide communications services or electric service, the applicant seeking to collocate a small wireless facility shall provide a make-ready estimate at the applicant's expense for the work necessary to support the small wireless facility, including pole replacement, and perform the make-ready work. If pole replacement is required, the scope of the make-ready estimate is limited to the design, fabrication, and installation of a utility pole that is substantially similar in color and composition. The city shall not condition or restrict the manner in which the applicant obtains, develops, or provides the estimate or conducts the make-ready work subject to usual construction restoration standards for work in the right-of-way. The replaced or altered utility pole shall remain the property of the city. 
(2)  The city shall not require more make-ready work than is required to meet applicable codes or industry standards. 
(3)  Fees for make-ready work shall not include costs related to preexisting damage or prior noncompliance. Fees for make-ready work, including any pole replacement, shall not exceed actual costs or the amount charged to communications service providers other than wireless services providers for similar work and shall not include any consultant fee or expense. 
(4)  Fees for make-ready work must be paid to the city, even if they exceed the applicant's estimate, before the wireless facilities may be operational.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city may in its sound discretion accept a corporate guarantee of the registrant's parent company, if it has sufficient financial strength and reserves, in lieu of the security fund.

(b)  In addition, violation of this article may be punishable as provided in F.S. § 162.22, as it may be amended. 
(c)  Before imposing a fine pursuant to this section, the city manager or the city manager's designee shall give written notice of the violation and its intention to assess such penalties, which notice shall contain a description of the alleged violation. Following receipt of such notice, the registrant shall have 30 days to either: (a) cure the violation to the city's satisfaction and the city shall make good faith reasonable efforts to assist in resolving the violation; or (b) file an appeal with the city to contest the alleged violation. Section 40-88 shall govern such appeal. If no appeal is filed and if the violation is not cured within the 30-day period, the city may collect all fines owed, beginning with the first day of the violation, through any means allowed by law. 
(d)  In determining which remedy is appropriate, the city shall take into consideration the nature of the violation, the person bearing the impact of the violation, the nature of the remedy required in order to prevent further violations, and such other matters as the city determines are appropriate to the public interest. In any proceeding before the city where there exists an issue with respect to a registrant's performance of its obligations pursuant to this article, the registrant shall be given the opportunity to provide such information as it may have concerning its compliance with the terms and conditions of this article.

(b)  The amounts charged pursuant to this section shall be based on the linear miles of rights-of-way where a wireless communications facility is placed, not based on a summation of the lengths of individual cables, conduits, strands or fibers. Multiple cables, conduits, strands, or fibers located within the same conduit shall be considered one communications facility for purposes of this subsection.

Fees not paid shall bear interest at the rate of one percent per month from the date due until the wireless equipment is removed. The acceptance of any payment required hereunder by the city shall not be construed as an acknowledgement that the amount paid is the correct amount due, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim which the city may have for additional sums due and payable. All fee payments shall be subject to audit by the city, and assessment or refund if any payment is found to be in error. If such audit results in an assessment by and an additional payment to the city, such additional payment shall be subject to interest at the rate of one percent per month until the date payment is made.

Sec. 40-100. - Notice of transfer, sale or assignment of assets in public rights-of-way. 
    If a registrant transfers, sells or assigns its assets located in public rights-of-way incident to a transfer, sale or assignment of the registrant's assets, the transferee, buyer or assignee shall be obligated to comply with the terms of this article. Written notice of any such transfer, sale or assignment shall be provided by such registrant to the city within 20 days after the effective date of the transfer, sale or assignment. If the transferee, buyer or assignee is a current registrant, then the transferee, buyer or assignee is not required to re-register. If the transferee, buyer or assignee is not a current registrant, then the transferee, buyer or assignee shall register as provided in section 40-84 above, within 60 days of the transfer, sale or assignment. If permit applications are pending in the registrant's name, the transferee, buyer or assignee shall notify the public works department that the transferee, buyer or assignee is the new applicant. 
(Ord. No. 3075-17 , § 7, 4-24-17) 

Exhibit 1. Simulated fluted pole to be manufactured by Nepsa with capacity for two internal, collocated wireless antennas. Decorative mast arm and down lighting luminaire by Sternberg Lighting, the manufacturer of the City's decorative lights. This would be an acceptable design with an arm that matched the design of the city's existing decorative lights; however, the pole's location, mere inches from the curb, would violate the eight-foot clear space requirement from the curb or edge of pavement. The light pole design may also be acceptable on certain streets with double mast arms matching the design of the city's existing decorative lights and down lighting luminaires by Sternberg mirroring one other. 

Exhibit 2. The antenna is narrower than, and in scale with the pole. This may be an acceptable design for a cobra-style light fixture; however, the city is transitioning from cobra lights to decorative lights. The applicant would need to remove its wireless facility within 30 days upon notice that the city will replace the light pole and fixture. 

Exhibit 3. An antenna incorporated into, and hidden in the pole of top mounted, pedestrian scaled light may be acceptable if painted black, featured an acorn luminaire, and otherwise substantially resembled the acorn light fixtures already existing in the city. The photo depicts a Philips pole with internal Ericsson antennas. 

Exhibit 4. The antenna, by Valmont, is painted black to blend-in with the pole and is in scale with the pole base. The arm is within the top 15-20 percent of the pole height, appearing in balance. This may be an acceptable design if the pole otherwise resembled the city's decorative pole features. 

Exhibit 5. The base is out-of-scale to the arms and luninaires. In addition, while symmetrical, the pole and antenna extend far above the luminaires, making the design appear vertically out of proportion. Arms and luminaries should be within the top 2 percent of the pole height. This design is prohibited; however, a similar design may be acceptable with appropriate modifications. 

Exhibit 6. Wireless facilities over, or within 20 feet of energized wires are prohibited. 

Exhibit 7. The antenna enclosure has a larger diameter than the pole, rendering it insufficiently cloaked. This design is prohibited. 

Exhibit 8. The antenna is wider than, and out-of-scale to the pole. This design is prohibited. 

Exhibit 9. The antenna extends horizontally from the pole. This design is prohibited. 

Exhibit 10. Wooden poles are prohibited. The city is transitioning away from wooden poles. In addition, the top-mounted antennas extend on arms away from the pole. This design is prohibited. 

Exhibit 11. Antennas on arms are prohibited. 

Exhibit 12. The pole lacks a base in scale to the volume of the antenna, which is larger than the diameter of the pole and does not appear to be an original part of the pole. This design would be prohibited. 

Exhibit 13. The base is out-of-scale to the size of the luminaire. In addition, the antenna is larger than the pole diameter and does not look like an original part of the pole. This design would be prohibited. 

Exhibit 14. The location context for this small cell monopole is not reasonable because it creates a cluttered appearance. In addition, the antenna is larger than the diameter of the pole, lacks of pole base of comparable volume, and is vertically out-of-scale to the existing streetlights.

(Ord. No. 2715-07, § B, 6-11-07) 
Sec. 46-53. - Applicability. 
    This article and the city commission's authority to impose assessments and fees pursuant to this article shall be applicable throughout the incorporated areas of the city, as may be amended from time to time. 
(Ord. No. 2715-07, § C, 6-11-07) 
Sec. 46-54. - Alternative method. 
(a)  This article shall be deemed to provide an additional and alternative method for the doing of the things authorized hereby and shall be regarded as supplemental and additional to powers conferred by other laws, and shall not be regarded as in derogation of any powers now existing or which may hereafter come into existence. This article, being necessary for the welfare of the inhabitants of the city, shall be liberally construed to effect the purposes hereof. 
(b)  Nothing in this article shall preclude the city commission from directing and authorizing, by resolution, the combination with each other of:

(Ord. No. 2715-07, § D, 6-11-07) 
Sec. 46-55. - Fire rescue fee on government property. 
(a)  Legislative declarations as to fire rescue fee on government property. It is hereby ascertained and declared that the fire rescue fee as authorized in this article is reasonably related to the cost of providing fire rescue services, facilities and programs to government property. The fire rescue fee is not a special assessment; it is a fee for services available and rendered to government property. 
(b)  General authority. 
(1)  The city commission is hereby authorized to impose a fire rescue fee on all government property that is improved by the existence or construction of a building to fund all or any portion of the fire rescue cost for government property at a fair, just, reasonable and equitable rate based upon such property's historical demand and reasonable cost of providing fire rescue and first response emergency medical services to such property. 
(2)  The rate of the fire rescue fee for each classification of government property shall be determined by a subsequently adopted fire rescue fee rate resolution. The fire rescue fee rate resolution shall determine the fire rescue cost for government property and allocate such cost in a fair, reasonable, just and equitable manner among all government property.

Sec. 46-56. - Fire rescue assessments on non-government property. 
(a)  Legislative declarations as to the existence of special benefit. It is further hereby ascertained and declared that the fire rescue services, facilities, and programs provide a special benefit to non-government property that is improved by the existence or construction of a building based upon the following legislative determinations: 
(1)  Fire rescue services possess a logical relationship to the use and enjoyment of improved property by: 
a.  Protecting the value of the improvements and structures through the provision of available fire rescue services; 
b.  Protecting the life and safety of intended occupants in the use and enjoyment of improvements and structures within improved parcels; 
c.  Lowering the cost of fire insurance by the presence of a professional and comprehensive fire rescue program within the city; and 
d.  Containing the spread of fire incidents occurring on vacant property with the potential to spread and endanger the structures and occupants of improved property. 
(2)  The combined fire control and first response emergency medical services of the city under its existing consolidated fire rescue program enhances and strengthens the relationship of such services to the use and enjoyment of buildings within improved parcels of property within the areas served by the city. 
(3)  Within the areas served by the city, the combined fire control and first response emergency medical services of the city under its existing consolidated fire rescue program enhance the value of business and commercial property that is improved by the existence or construction of a building, which enhanced value can be anticipated to be reflected in the rental charge or value of such business or commercial property. 
(b)  General authority. 
(1)  The city commission is hereby authorized to impose a fire rescue assessment to fund all or any portion of the fire rescue cost for assessed property upon benefitted non-government property at a rate of assessment based on the special benefit accruing to such property from the city's provision of fire rescue services, facilities, or programs. 
(2)  All fire rescue assessments shall be imposed in a subsequently adopted fire rescue assessment rate resolution. Such fire rescue assessment rate resolution shall determine the amount of the fire rescue assessment against assessed property pursuant to an apportionment methodology based upon a classification of property designed to provide a fair and reasonable apportionment of the fire rescue cost for assessed property among properties on a basis reasonably related to the special benefit provided by fire rescue services, facilities, or programs funded with assessment proceeds. 
(Ord. No. 2715-07, § F, 6-11-07) 
Sec. 46-57. - Collection. 
(a)  Collection of fire rescue charges on the utility bill. 
(1)  The fire rescue charge may be billed to and collected on a monthly basis along with the city's utility in the regular utility billing cycle, appearing as a separate line item. 
(2)  The utility customer of record and the owner of such property subject to a fire rescue charge are responsible for payment of the fire rescue charge as the charge is either a fire rescue fee on government property which is in exchange for services and facilities furnished to such property to manage and control the fire rescue burden generated by the use and development of such property, or alternatively, the charge is a fire rescue assessment on non-government property for which the property receives a special benefit from the provision of fire rescue services, facilities and programs by the city. 
(3)  Bills for the fire rescue charge shall be payable at the same time, in the same manner, and subject to the same penalties as have been heretofore established for other utility fees charged and administered by the city. The owner and utility customer of record shall be notified of any deficiency in the payment of the fire rescue charge in the same manner as other delinquent utility bills. The failure to pay such a fire rescue charge shall subject the property to the discontinuance of other utility services and all other penalties and charges available under law relative to the discontinuance of such utility services. The administrative appeal and hearing procedure applicable to the discontinuance of other utility services in the city shall be applicable to the discontinuance of such services for any delinquencies resulting under this article. 
(4)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the city may make alternative collection arrangements with property owners or tenants or both for the payment of the fire rescue charge. 
(b)  Alternative method of collection of fire rescue assessments. In lieu of utilizing the utility bill, the city commission may elect to collect fire rescue assessments by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act or any other method which is authorized by law or under the alternative collection method provided by this section. 
(1)  The city shall provide fire rescue assessment bills by first class mail to the owner of each affected parcel of property, other than government property. The bill or accompanying explanatory material shall include: 
a.  A brief explanation of the fire rescue assessment; 
b.  A description of the unit of measurement used to determine the amount of the fire rescue assessment; 
c.  The number of units contained within the parcel; 
d.  The total amount of the fire rescue assessment imposed against the parcel for the appropriate period; 
e.  The location at which payment will be accepted; 
f.  The date on which the fire rescue assessment is due; and 
g.  A statement that the fire rescue assessment constitutes a lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and other non-ad valorem assessments. 
(2)  A general notice of the lien resulting from imposition of the fire rescue assessments shall be recorded in the official records of the county. Nothing in this article shall be construed to require that individual liens or releases be filed in the official records. 
(3)  The city shall have the right to collect all delinquent fire rescue assessments in the manner provided for the delinquent utility bills or in any manner provided by law for the foreclosure of mortgages on real property or appoint or retain an agent to institute such foreclosure and collection proceedings. 
(4)  A fire rescue assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within 60 days from the date any installment is due. The city or its agent shall notify any property owner who is delinquent in payment of his fire rescue assessment within 90 days from the date such assessment was due. Such notice shall state in effect that the city or its agent will either: 
a.  Initiate a foreclosure action or suit in equity and cause the foreclosure of such property subject to a delinquent fire rescue assessment in a method now or hereafter provided by law for foreclosure of mortgages on real property; or 
b.  Cause an amount equivalent to the delinquent fire rescue assessment, not previously subject to collection using the uniform method under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, to be collected on the tax bill for a subsequent year. 
(5)  All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related to any foreclosure action as described in this article shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein. At the sale pursuant to decree in any such action, the city may be the purchaser to the same extent as any person. The city or its agent may join in one foreclosure action for the collection of fire rescue assessments against any or all property assessed in accordance with the provisions of this article. All delinquent owners whose property is foreclosed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city and its agents, including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent fire rescue assessments and any other costs incurred by the city as a result of such delinquent fire rescue assessments and the costs shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, the costs of the action. 
(6)  In lieu of foreclosure, any delinquent fire rescue assessment and the costs, fees and expenses attributable thereto, may be collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; provided however, that (i) notice is provided to the owner in the manner required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act and this article, and (ii) any existing lien of record on the affected parcel for the delinquent fire rescue assessment is supplanted by the lien resulting from certification of the assessment roll, as applicable, to the tax collector. 
(7)  Notwithstanding the city's use of an alternative method of collection, the city manager shall have the same power and authority to correct errors and omissions as provided to him or other city officials in subsection (3) above. 
(8)  Any city commission action required in the collection of fire rescue assessments may be by resolution. 
(c)  Correction of errors and omissions. 
(1)  No act of error or omission on the part of the city manager, city commission, or their deputies or employees, shall operate to release or discharge any obligation for payment of a fire rescue charge imposed by the city commission under the provision of this article. 
(2)  When it shall appear that any fire rescue charge should have been imposed under this article against property specially benefitted by the provision of fire rescue services, facilities, or programs, but that such property was omitted from the bill, the city may impose the applicable fire rescue charge against the property for which such error is discovered, in addition to the applicable fire rescue charge due for the prior 24 months. Such delinquent fire rescue charge may be collected as provided for the collection of other charges on the utility bill, or may be collected as provided in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, or may be collected as a lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district, or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles, and claims in and to or against the real property involved, and shall be deemed perfected on the date of adoption of the resolution imposing the omitted or delinquent assessments.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2874-12, § 2, adopted April 23, 2012, amended the Code by the addition of §§ 54-2-54-10, however, said provisions have been redesignated as §§ 54-21-54-29, at the editor's discretion, for purposes of allowing future expansion of the Code. 

Sec. 54-21. - Findings of fact; intent and purpose. 
(a)  The City of Winter Park Board of City Commissioners are advised and informed that a pattern of illegal drug use and distribution of certain dangerous drugs has been linked in large part to certain pain management clinics operating in and around the Central Florida area and the City of Winter Park and distributing or prescribing dangerous drugs; and 
(b)  Certain opiate analgesic dangerous drugs, that may be safe when used moderately or properly, have been shown to be particularly dangerous when overprescribed by doctors in specialized businesses that are primarily focused on treating large numbers of persons who complain of any pain with very high doses of opiate drugs; and have been shown to be particularly dangerous when overconsumed by citizens and visitors who may obtain a large number of such opiate drugs by engaging in doctor shopping to obtain multiple prescriptions, close in time, from multiple doctors, by failing to disclose prior recent prescriptions to subsequent doctors, and then obtaining the prescriptions from multiple dispending pharmacies, often by using multiple and false identities at both medical clinics and pharmacies; and 
(c)  The dangerous overprescribing and excessive consumption of high amounts of those dangerous opiate prescription drugs has resulted in increased addiction of persons, increased crime associated with such activity, and resulted in a high number of deaths in Central Florida related to prescription drug abuse and has created an urgent situation requiring immediate action to reduce the threat to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City of Winter Park; and 
(d)  The State of Florida has implemented a prescription drug monitoring program which could be an effective tool in the City of Winter Park to reduce successful doctor shopping, or multiple prescriptions, or multiple pharmacy filling of prescriptions and dispensing of potentially dangerous opiate drugs, if local physicians are careful to check the database before prescribing potentially dangerous opiate drugs; and if reports are made to the database immediately when potentially dangerous opiate drugs are prescribed by local physicians or dispensed by local pharmacies so that other physicians and pharmacies can know that information; and 
(e)  Certain opiate analgesic drugs have been shown to be particularly dangerous when overprescribed by doctors or overconsumed by citizens and visitors; and 
(f)  The illegal distribution of these dangerous prescription drugs, increased crime associated with such activity, and the high number of deaths in Central Florida relating to prescription drug abuse has created an urgent situation requiring immediate action to reduce the threat to the health, safety and welfare of the City of Winter Park citizens; and 
(g)  On July 19, 2011, Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs' prescription drug task force (task force) began a series of meetings to address the serious issue of prescription drug abuse in Orange County through law enforcement, healthcare and pharmacies, prevention education, and public policy; and 
(h)  The Florida Legislature has identified concerns regarding the increased use and abuse of substances controlled by federal and/or state law and the frequency of injury and death occurring as a result of the increased availability of controlled substances and certain dangerous prescription drugs via medical practitioners operating in pain management clinics or facilities; and 
(i)  Florida Statutes require physicians and other persons dispensing prescription drugs through pain management clinics, facilities or offices, to register with the state department of health in order to conduct such business; and 
(j)  The negative adverse secondary impacts associated with certain pain management clinics includes the congregation of drug users and drug addicted persons outside of pain management clinics in a manner that has a negative effect on the willingness of residents to patronize nearby business and which disturbs nearby residents all hours of the day but particularly in the early morning and late evening hours thus disrupting other businesses and disturbing the peace and quiet of affected parts of the community; and 
(k)  It is not the intent of this article to interfere with the legal and safe prescription, dispensation, or use of controlled substances. It is the excessive distribution of a narrow class of opiate analgesic prescription drugs that are schedule II and III controlled substances (except Buprenorphine (Subutex&reg;) and Buprenorphine-naloxone (Suboxone&reg;), which are used for treating addiction) that this article seeks to regulate; and 
(l)  Under its home rule authority, the City of Winter Park can pass additional legislation to further regulate pain management clinics and pharmacies as long as these additional regulations are not preempted in the law and are not inconsistent with the statutory provisions. 
(Ord. No. 2874-12, § 2, 4-23-12) 
Sec. 54-22. - Definitions. 
    For purposes of this article, the following terms, whether appearing in the singular or plural form, shall have the following meanings. All other terms used in this article shall have the meaning provided in Chapter 2011-141, Laws of Florida, as it may be amended from time to time. 
    Acute pain means the normal, predicted, physiological response to an adverse chemical, thermal, or mechanical stimulus and is associated with surgery, trauma, or illness. It is generally short-lived. Acute pain responses may vary between patients and between pain episodes within an individual patient. Acute pain episodes may be present in patients with chronic pain. 
    Chronic pain means pain which includes one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the pain persists beyond the usual course of a disease that is the cause of the pain; (b) the pain persists beyond the expected time for healing from an injury or trauma that is the cause of the pain; or (c) the pain is associated with a long-term incurable or intractable medical illness or disease and is not amenable to routine pain control methods. 
    Controlled substance means any substance named or described in Schedules I-V of F.S. § 893.03. 
    Dangerous drugs means a controlled substance, specifically an opiate analgesic, listed in Schedule II and Schedule III, in F.S. § 893.03, but not including Buprenorphine (Subutex&reg;) and Buprenorphinenaloxone (Suboxone&reg;). 
    Health care physician or physician means any practitioner who is subject to licensure or regulation by the Florida Department of Health under F.S. ch. 458 (physician) or 459 (osteopathic physician). 
    Pain means an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage. Categories of pain include acute pain or chronic pain. 
    Pain management means the use of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to control a patient's identified pain. Pain management often extends beyond pain relief, encompassing the patient's quality of life, ability to work productively, to enjoy recreation, and to function normally in family and society. 
    Pain management clinic means any privately-owned clinic, facility or office, whatever its title, including, but not limited to, a "wellness center", "urgent care facility", or "detox center," which has at least one of the following characteristics: 
(1)  Where a physician practices who issues prescriptions for a dangerous drug to more than 20 patients in a single day; 
(2)  It holds itself out through a sign or advertising in any medium as being in business to prescribe or dispense pain medication, whether for acute pain or chronic pain; 
(3)  It holds itself out through a sign or advertising in any medium as being in business to provide services for the treatment or management of pain and where the services are also accompanied with the prescription or dispensing of a dangerous drug for the treatment of pain, whether acute pain or chronic pain; or 
(4)  It meets the definition of pain management clinic in F.S. § 458.3265, as may be amended from time to time, or is registered as a pain management clinic with the state. 
Exceptions. There is an affirmative defense that a business is not a pain management clinic if it has at least one of the following characteristics: 
(1)  Licensed as a hospital or other licensed facility pursuant to F.S. ch. 395, as may be amended; 
(2)  The majority of the physicians who provide services in the clinic primarily provide surgical services; 
(3)  Affiliated with an accredited medical school at which training is provided for medical students, residents, or fellows; 
(4)  Does not prescribe or dispense controlled substance for the treatment of pain; or 
(5)  Operated for the sole purpose of service [to] a governmental entity. 
    Pharmacist means any person licensed pursuant to F.S. ch. 465, to practice the profession of pharmacy. 
    Pharmacy means the same as that term is defined in F.S. § 465.003, as may be amended from time to time, and includes community pharmacy, internet pharmacy, and special pharmacy, but does not include institutional pharmacy or nuclear pharmacy, as each of those terms are used in that section. 
    Physician primarily engaged in the treatment of pain means a physician who prescribes or dispenses dangerous drugs when a substantial portion of the patients seen are prescribed or dispensed dangerous drugs for the treatment of chronic pain. For purposes of this definition, the term "substantial portion" means more than insignificant or incidental portion. The term "substantial portion" does not necessarily mean a majority or predominant amount.

(Ord. No. 2264, § 1, 6-23-98; Ord. No. 2762-09, § 3, 2-23-09) 
Sec. 58-6. - Amendments to the comprehensive plan. 
(a)  Amendments to the comprehensive plan shall, at a minimum, conform to the requirements as specified within F.S. ch. 163, pt. II. 
(1)  A comprehensive plan text or map amendment may be proposed by the city commission or the planning and zoning board or may be proposed by any individual, corporation, partnership or other entity having a bona fide interest in property either by ownership or by standing under a contract to purchase such land. All comprehensive plan text or map amendments must be made by ordinance. Applications shall be submitted on a standard application form accompanied by all pertinent information which may be required for proper consideration of the matter, along with payment of fees and charges as established by the city commission. Applicants shall include prospective plans indicating the desired development scenario proposed as a result of an approval per the plan submission requirements established for conditional uses. 
(2)  All proposed comprehensive plan text or map amendments shall be submitted to the planning and zoning board for study and recommendation. The planning and zoning board shall study such proposals to determine: 
a.  The need and justification for the change; 
b.  When pertaining to the future land use designation of land, the effect of the change, if any, on the particular property and the surrounding properties; 
c.  When pertaining to the future land use designation of land, the amount of undeveloped land in the general area and in the city having the same classification as that requested; and 
d.  The relationship of the proposed amendment to the goals, objectives and policies text of the city's comprehensive plan, with appropriate consideration as to whether the proposed change will further, or at least not be contrary to the comprehensive plan. 
(3)  No recommendation for transmittal or adoption of any amendment to the comprehensive plan shall be made by the planning and zoning board until and unless a public hearing has been held. In addition to the public notice requirements of F.S. ch. 163, pt. II, the city shall also conform to the following notice requirements. Notice shall be provided based upon the type and size of the request as detailed below. In cases where requests are not specifically indicated in this section, the planning director shall determine the most appropriate level of public notice. 
a.  For any proposed map amendment to the comprehensive plan involving land of less than 80,000 square feet, notice of the public hearings for transmittal in the case of large-scale amendments or for adoption in the case of small-scale amendments shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the city at least 15 days in advance of the public hearing; written notice of the time and place of such meeting and the proposed action to be taken shall be posted upon the property and mailed to all owners of record of property within 1,500 feet of the property requested for map amendment at least 15 days prior to the public hearing. The public notice posted on the property shall be erected to be in full view of the general public on each street side of said land and shall be erected by the applicant. 
b.  For any proposed map amendment to the comprehensive plan involving land of 80,000 square feet or more or for any comprehensive plan text amendment to the goals, objectives and policies of the comprehensive plan affecting more than 80,000 square feet of land shall require notice of the public hearings for transmittal in the case of large-scale amendments or for adoption in the case of small-scale amendments, to be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the city at least 30 days in advance of the public hearings; written notice of the time and place of such meeting and the proposed action to be taken shall be posted upon the property affected by the map amendment and mailed to all owners of record of property within 1,500 feet of the property requested for map amendment as well as mailed to all households as determined from the listing of utility billing addresses within the entire city limits at least 30 days prior to the public hearing. The public notice posted on the property shall be erected to be in full view of the general public on each street side of said land and shall be erected by the applicant. Any public notice required after the initial public hearing for which a city-wide notice has already been mailed by the planning and zoning board or city commission due to tabling, continuance, postponement or any other action by the planning board shall revert to the 15-day notice so as to allow for requests to be heard at the next regular or special meeting of the planning and zoning board or city commission. This city-wide notice mailing requirement shall not apply to any comprehensive plan text amendment that changes the city's five-year capital improvements plan or narrative thereto or other portions of the capital improvements element required to be adopted annually in order to coincide with the annual adoption of the city's budget and capital improvements program and shall also not apply to any comprehensive plan map amendment related to annexations that have been previously approved pursuant to F.S. ch. 171, as may be necessary to update the city boundaries or to establish existing or future land use designations for annexed properties as long as there is no change to the existing and future land use designations in the Orange County Comprehensive Plan. 
(4)  The planning and zoning commission following their public hearing may recommend approval, approval with conditions, denial or submit such request with no recommendation to the city commission in the case of a tie vote. However, if the planning and zoning commission makes no recommendation following two additional advertised public hearings from the date of the initial public hearing, it shall be considered submitted to the city commission with a recommendation for denial on the proposed comprehensive plan text or map amendment. This provision shall not include any public hearing during which the applicant requests that their application be tabled, postponed or continued or any public hearing where the planning commission deems that the plans or other materials submitted do not meet the application submission requirements, notice is deemed insufficient or any other procedural deficiency. 
(5)  Upon the filing of the recommendations report by the planning and zoning board, or upon failure to do so with respect to any proposed comprehensive plan text or map amendment, the city commission shall hold the first public hearing on the ordinance to transmit and adopt the comprehensive plan amendment, and in a timely fashion in accordance with Florida law, the city commission will hold a second public hearing on the ordinance to adopt such comprehensive plan amendment, with such notice and hearings to be conducted in the manner prescribed by law. With respect to small-scale amendments that do not require transmittal to the State of Florida, there shall be two public hearings on the ordinance for adoption of such small-scale amendments, giving at least 15 days' notice of time and place of such hearings, which notice shall first be published in a newspaper having a general circulation in the City of Winter Park, Florida. 
(6)  In case of a recommendation for denial, either to transmit or adopt, by the planning and zoning commission, such amendments shall not proceed or become effective except by the majority vote of the city commission. In cases when the planning and zoning commission recommends approval of a comprehensive plan future land use map amendment or text amendment on a lesser portion of the property than originally requested, or imposes conditions upon or limitations upon a recommendation for approval reducing the intensity or density of use of said property or text amendment, it shall require the majority vote of the city commission to transmit or adopt such comprehensive plan future land use map or text amendment for a greater portion of the property or to increase the density or intensity of use above that recommended by the planning and zoning commission. 
(7)  Whenever the city commission has, by amendment, changed the comprehensive plan future land use designation of a property, the planning and zoning commission shall not consider any petition for the further amendment of any part or all of the same property for a period of one year from the effective date of the amendatory ordinance. Whenever the planning and zoning commission has taken action to recommend the denial of a petition for the change in the comprehensive plan land use designation of a property and that recommendation for denial has been approved by the city commission, or when the planning and zoning commission has recommended granting a petition for the change in the comprehensive plan future land use designation of a property and the city commission has reversed that recommendation and denied the petition, the city shall not: 
a.  Consider any further petition for the same future land use designation of any part or all of the same property for a period of one year from date of such action by the city commission, or 
b.  Consider a petition for any other kind of future land use designation on any part or all of the same property of a period of one year from the date of such action by the city commission. 
The time limits of these subsections may be waived by the affirmative vote of four members of the city commission, when such action is deemed necessary to prevent injustice or to facilitate the proper development of the city. 
(8)  The decision of the city commission on any comprehensive plan amendment shall be by ordinance. That decision may be made to affirm or deny the original request of the applicant or it may modify the request to approve a portion of the request or alternative version of comprehensive plan text or map amendment. The city commission may impose conditions upon the approval of a comprehensive plan amendment. Such conditions may restrict the range of permitted uses within a comprehensive plan designation and such conditions may also restrict or impose requirements upon the development or use of such land such as limitations on building size, height, setbacks or other site design or building design or use features. 
(9)  Whenever the secretary to the planning and zoning commission or city clerk has received a written request for a continuation, delay or postponement of a public hearing from an applicant after such public hearing has been duly advertised, the planning and zoning commission or city commission may grant the applicant's request. The commission shall reschedule the public hearing to any future scheduled meeting within the following six months. Such rescheduling shall meet with the approval of the applicant. The applicant shall pay a second filing fee to cover necessary administration, public notice and other expenses. If, after the second public hearing has been duly advertised and the applicant again requests a delay, postponement or continuation, or if the applicant does not agree with the rescheduling of the public hearing within the six-month period, the planning and zoning commission or city commission shall duly act to deny the request of the applicant, and a new request for this property will not be accepted for a period of one year from the date of the second scheduled public hearing. 
(10)  Whenever an applicant submits plans as required by this section, only the plans submitted to the planning and zoning commission members prior to the public hearing for their review together with a staff report analysis and other pertinent information shall be the basis for action by the planning and zoning commission. If those plans are substantially modified, then such application shall be postponed and re-advertised for a subsequent meeting. Similarly, when the planning and zoning commission makes a recommendation on an application pursuant to specific plans, and those plans are substantially modified for submission to the city commission public hearing, then the modified plans shall first be reviewed by the planning and zoning commission for recommendation before they are considered by the city commission for approval. The city commission shall not act on any application containing modified plans but shall refer the modified plans back to the planning and zoning commission, for subsequent review and recommendation unless such changes are in response to specific conditions of approval made by the planning and zoning commission.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2909-13, § 5, adopted April 22, 2013, repealed § 58-7 in its entirety, which pertained to development agreements and derived from Ord. No. 2267, § 1, adopted July 14, 1998. 
ARTICLE II. - CONCURRENCY MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS 

Sec. 58-31. - Introduction; summary. 
    This article implements the concurrency management regulations mandated by F.S. ch. 163 as well as serving as an implementation mechanism for the city's comprehensive plan. 
(Ord. No. 2788-09, § 1, 11-23-09; Ord. No. 3097-17 , § 1(Exh. A), 12-11-17) 
Sec. 58-32. - Purpose. 
(a)  The purpose of this article is to enable growth and development to proceed in the city in compliance with the city's comprehensive plan. As such, this article implements the concurrency provisions of the comprehensive plan that are mandated by F.S. ch. 163 and to provide for the implementation of the city's comprehensive plan. 
(b)  The city commission has determined and recognized that new growth and development may necessitate expansions and improvements of infrastructure. In order to assure capacity in infrastructure systems for new growth, all new development will be reviewed to determine the effect of such development on the infrastructure systems within the city. No new development or redevelopment will be permitted which would have the effect of degrading the level of service of any infrastructure system below that level established in the comprehensive plan. 
(c)  The City of Winter Park sponsors or experiences several special events each year such as the Winter Park Arts Festival. Such events generate temporary peak demands on the infrastructure. It would be an unnecessary and unreasonable expense to the public to develop public infrastructure to support completely such temporary periods of usage. It is not the purpose of this article to require the complete infrastructure for these occasional special events. 
(Ord. No. 2788-09, § 1, 11-23-09; Ord. No. 3097-17 , § 1(Exh. A), 12-11-17) 
Sec. 58-33. - Concurrency requirements.

(1)  Building permit; 
(2)  Permitted use approval; 
(3)  Conditional use approval; 
(4)  Site plan approval; 
(5)  Preliminary or final plat; 
(6)  Planned unit development; 
(7)  Development agreement. 
(b)  A concurrency approval shall be required prior to commencement of construction of any new public facilities, or expansion thereof, whether or not a final development order or building permit is issued by the city. 
(c)  A concurrency approval shall be required prior to the commencement of construction within the city of any new public facilities by any other government, school board or quasi-governmental agency. 
(d)  A concurrency approval shall not be required to be granted by the city and the following development orders are exempted from the requirements of this article: 
(1)  Development orders or building permits for single family homes or duplexes within existing platted subdivisions of record recorded prior to the effective date of the article where all infrastructure required within the subdivision to support the property has been provided and accepted by the city; 
(2)  Development orders or building permits for other residential or non-residential development where the following standards are not exceeded: 
Water: Residential projects of ten units or less or 10,000 square feet or less for non-residential projects. 
Sewer: Residential projects of ten units or less or 10,000 square feet or less for non-residential projects. 
(3)  Reserved. 
(4)  Development orders or building permits for residential development identified as exempt residential uses pursuant to the public schools facilities element (Comprehensive Plan Policy 9-1.3.6 standards.) 
(Ord. No. 2788-09, § 1, 11-23-09; Ord. No. 3097-17 , § 1(Exh. A), 12-11-17) 
Sec. 58-34. - Change of use. 
(a)  Increased impact on public facilities or services. If a proposed change of use shall have a greater impact on public facilities and/or services than the previous use, a capacity approval shall be required for the net increase only. 
(b)  Decreased impact on public facilities and services. If the proposed change of use shall have an impact on public facilities and/or services which is equal to or less than the previous use, then the proposed change, redevelopment or modification of use may proceed without the encumbrance of additional capacity in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(c)  Definition of "previous use." For purposes of this section, the term "previous use" shall mean either: (1) the use existing on the site when a concurrency evaluation is sought; or (2) if no active use exists on the site at the time when a concurrency evaluation is sought, then the most recent use on the site within the ten-year period immediately prior to the date of application. The applicant shall provide reasonably sufficient evidence to the satisfaction of the city which establishes the existence of such use. Such evidence may include, but shall not be limited to, utility records, phone bills, income tax returns, tax bills, occupational licenses, etc. 
Sec. 58-35. - Concurrency approval application and review procedures. 
(a)  Development projects shall be reviewed to determine the effect of the project on the capacity of the following infrastructure systems: 
(1)  Potable water production capacity; 
(2)  Sanitary sewer treatment capacity; 
(3)  Park and conservation land capacity; 
(4)  Drainage/stormwater management; and 
(5)  Solid waste collection and disposal capacity. 
(6)  Public school capacity. 
(b)  Review shall be initiated by the owner, developer or authorized agent by submitting a site plan drawn from or based on a survey of the site, legal description of the property and all other information requested so that a determination of the size, scale and nature of the infrastructure impacts can be determined. Incomplete submittals will be returned to the applicant. Applications shall be reviewed in the order of acceptance as complete. 
(Ord. No. 2788-09, § 1, 11-23-09; Ord. No. 3097-17 , § 1(Exh. A), 12-11-17) 
Sec. 58-36. - Concurrency determination and issuance of concurrency approval. 
(a)  Upon completion of a review by city staff, a concurrency determination shall be made by city staff whether infrastructure capacity is available to accommodate the proposed project. For any project needing an approval by the city commission, the staff report shall indicate if inadequate infrastructure capacity exists and in the absence of such indication, adequate capacity shall be deemed to be available. For any project needing only a building permit approval the staff review comments shall indicate if inadequate infrastructure capacity exists and in the absence of such indication, adequate capacity shall be deemed to be available. 
(b)  If the necessary capacity is not available, the concurrency determination shall identify each infrastructure system where capacity is not available and the extent of the deficiency. 
(Ord. No. 3097-17 , § 1(Exh. A), 12-11-17) 
Sec. 58-37. - Expiration of concurrency approvals. 
(a)  The concurrency approval shall expire upon the expiration of the building permit or development order for which the certificate was issued including any extensions, renewals, or subsequent development orders for the same project. 
(b)  Where not otherwise provided a concurrency approval shall expire after one year. 
(Ord. No. 3097-17 , § 1(Exh. A), 12-11-17) 
Sec. 58-38. - Standards utilized for the review of concurrency approvals. 
    The standards utilized for review of available capacity for the issuance of concurrency approvals shall be the level of service standards established in the city's comprehensive plan. 
Sec. 58-39. - Concurrency evaluations. 
(a)  The city shall conduct a concurrency evaluation prior to the issuance or denial of a concurrency approval. The city shall utilize evaluation methodologies as may be approved by the city commission and the city may also consider, utilize and rely upon in whole or in part, other appropriate methodologies, evaluations, studies, documents, or other information submitted by the applicant that are deemed to provide accuracy in the quantification of infrastructure capacity impacts. 
(b)  Concurrency evaluations shall be conducted prior to the issuance of all development orders specified in this article as requiring a concurrency approval. In addition, a concurrency evaluation shall be prepared for review in conjunction with all preliminary plats in excess of four lots. For any project needing an approval by the city commission, the staff report shall indicate if inadequate infrastructure capacity exists and in the absence of such indication, adequate capacity shall be deemed to be available. For any project needing only a building permit approval the staff review comments shall indicate if inadequate infrastructure capacity exists and in the absence of such indication, adequate capacity shall be deemed to be available. 
(c)  Concurrency evaluations shall also be prepared for review in conjunction with applications for comprehensive plan text and map amendments and re-zonings. For any project needing an approval by the city commission, the staff report shall indicate if inadequate infrastructure capacity exists and in the absence of such indication, adequate capacity shall be deemed to be available. 
(Ord. No. 3097-17 , § 1(Exh. A), 12-11-17) 
Sec. 58-40. - Methods of capacity evaluation. 
(a)  In performing concurrency evaluations, the city staff shall determine the amount of infrastructure capacity necessary to serve the proposed development. If such amount of infrastructure capacity that will be generated can be provided, then the development shall be deemed to be concurrent and, accordingly, the requested capacity approval may be issued. If the amount of infrastructure capacity that will be generated can not be provided, then the development shall be deemed not to be concurrent and, accordingly, the requested capacity approval shall not be issued. 
(b)  In order to measure the demands for infrastructure capacity from development, the following methods shall be utilized: 
Infrastructure System Method Sanitary sewer Capacity-Established by Florida Department of Environmental Regulation. Demand-Customer demand based on past usage by similar users. Potable water Capacity-Established by Florida Department of Environmental Regulation. Demand-Customer demand based on records of past usage by similar users. Solid waste Capacity-As determined by Orange County. Demand-Average customer demand based on records of past usage. Parks Capacity-Total existing park and conservation land acreage. Demand-Number of permanent residential housing units × 2.2 persons. Drainage Established in the stormwater management provisions of article VI of this chapter. Public school facilities Capacity-Established by Orange County Public Schools (OCPS) using the adjusted FISH (Florida Inventory of School Houses) capacity for each school and capacity service area. Demand-The number of students generated by residential development shall be calculated by multiplying the number of housing units by the student generation rates by school type as set forth in Table 12 of the OCPS Facilities Data, Inventory and Analysis.  
(c)  In performing capacity evaluations for potable water and sanitary sewer capacity, the evaluation is limited to an assessment of the infrastructure capacity available at the applicable water production plant or sanitary sewage treatment facility. The concurrency evaluation does address the adequacy of capacity in water distribution pipes or sewer collection pipes necessary to serve the proposed development. The city may require the developer to fund or for the developer to cost share with the city, upgrades to the water distribution or sanitary sewer collection system in the general area of the project to address capacity sufficiency. It is the responsibility of applicants to ascertain whether the water distribution system or sewer collection system is adequately sized or in place as is necessary for that development. The performance of concurrency evaluations and the issuance of concurrency approvals does not relieve applicants of the responsibility to obtain permits from applicable state or federal agencies requiring such approvals. 
(d)  In performing concurrency evaluations for drainage, the evaluation is not limited to an assessment of the conformance to the city's storm water management ordinance as contained in this Land Development Code. The city may require the developer to fund or for the developer to cost share with the city, upgrades to the storm water conveyance system in the general area of the project to address capacity sufficiency. The performance of concurrency evaluations and the issuance of concurrency approvals also does not relieve applicants of the responsibility to obtain permits from applicable state or federal agencies requiring such approvals. 
(Ord. No. 2788-09, § 1, 11-23-09; Ord. No. 3097-17 , § 1(Exh. A), 12-11-17) 
Sec. 58-41. - Infrastructure capacity reporting and monitoring. 
    Periodically, the city staff shall complete and submit to the city commission a capacity availability report. This report shall evaluate development permitting activity and determine existing conditions with regard to available capacity for the infrastructure facilities subject to concurrency. The report shall specify the capacity used and shall evaluate and project the capacity available and the time remaining until available infrastructure capacity is exhausted. The report shall also include any vested capacity as well as that for which development orders have been issued. The report shall include survey data available from published sources and data specifically compiled by the city in order to monitor and maintain an accurate assessment of available infrastructure capacity and the use of existing infrastructure capacity.

The primary goals of the city, upon which the comprehensive plan was developed, are to preserve the natural beauty, pleasant environment and unique character of the city; to retain the quality of our existing residential neighborhoods by encouraging the residents to maintain and improve their property and protect these areas from the encroachment of detrimental and noncompatible land uses; and to insure that future residential areas are well planned and provided with full and adequate urban services. The intent of this zoning article is to insure that these goals are pursued and to insure that other necessary and desired land uses are located and regulated to encourage the development of the city toward the city's adopted goals. 
(3)  This article is also adopted for the following purposes: 
a.  To promote and protect the public health, safety, comfort, morals, and general welfare; 
b.  To secure adequate light, pure air, privacy, and convenience of access to property; 
c.  To regulate and limit the heights and size of buildings, to regulate and limit the intensity of use of lot areas, to regulate and determine the areas of open spaces between buildings, to classify, regulate and restrict the location of trades and industries and the location of buildings designed for specified industrial, business, residential and other uses; 
d.  To protect against fire, panic, explosion, noxious fumes and other dangers; 
e.  To secure clean waterways and other public bodies of water and to protect public land and conservation areas; 
f.  To promote a wholesome, serviceable and attractive city, increase the safety and security of home life, and preserve and create a more favorable living environment; 
g.  Encourage the redevelopment and renewal of blighted areas; 
h.  Encourage the elimination or reduction of uses inconsistent with the city's character and future land uses; 
i.  Discourage the proliferation of urban sprawl; 
j.  Ensure the availability of suitable land for utilities necessary to support proposed development; 
k.  Ensure the protection of natural resources, the natural environment and designated historically significant resources, structures and properties; and 
l.  Relate future growth and future land uses appropriately with topography, soil conditions and the availability of facilities and services; 
m.  Ensure smooth and orderly land use transition; 
n.  Ensure infill development is compatible with surrounding properties. 
(4)  This general statement of the goals, intent and purpose of this article includes, among others, the specific purposes set forth in the preamble to the respective districts and groups of districts. 
(5)  The city has developed over the years as a city with a unique character and environment. Since a primary goal of the city is to retain this environment as much as possible, this article must impose certain extraordinary restrictions on the use of land within the corporate limits of the city to insure that future development is in keeping with the existing development. 
(6)  The regulations and requirements herein set forth have been made in accordance with the city's comprehensive plan, adopted pursuant to F.S. ch. 163 and applicable rules of the state department of community affairs. In the preparation of the comprehensive plan, reasonable consideration has been given to, among other things, the prevailing land uses, growth characteristics and the character of respective districts and their peculiar suitability for particular uses, and the encouragement of the most appropriate use of land throughout the city. 
(b)  Official zoning map. 
(1)  The city is hereby divided into zones or districts as shown on the official zoning map, which together with all explanatory matter thereon, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this article. 
(2)  The official zoning map shall be identified by the signature of the mayor, attested by the city clerk and bearing the seal of the city under the following words: "This is to certify that this is the Official Zoning Map of the City of Winter Park, Florida." 
(3)  If in accordance with the provisions of these zoning regulations changes are made in district boundaries or other matter portrayed on the official zoning map, such changes shall be entered on the official zoning map promptly after the amendment has been approved by the city commission. 
(4)  No changes of any nature shall be made in the official zoning map or matter shown thereon except in conformity with the procedures set forth in this article. Any unauthorized change of whatever kind by any person or persons shall be considered a violation of this article. 
(5)  Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the official zoning map which may from time to time be made or published, the official zoning map which shall be located in city hall shall be the final authority as to the correct zoning status of land and water areas, buildings and other structures in the city. 
(c)  Replacement and updating of official zoning map. 
(1)  The city commission may by ordinance adopt a new official zoning map or amendments there to which shall supersede the prior official zoning map. 
(2)  The official zoning map may be updated from time to time to approved amendments or to include any updates, correct drafting or other errors or omissions in the prior official zoning map, but no such correction shall have the effect of amending the original official zoning map.

Sec. 58-62. - Rules for interpretation of district boundaries. 
    Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
(1)  Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center line of streets, highways or alleys shall be construed to follow such center lines. 
(2)  Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines shall be construed to follow such lot lines. 
(3)  Boundaries indicated as approximately following city limits shall be construed as following such city limits. 
(4)  Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed to be midway between the main tracks. 
(5)  Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed to follow such shorelines and in the event of change in the shoreline, shall be construed as moving with the actual shoreline; boundaries indicated as approximately following center lines of streams, canals, lakes or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such center lines. 
(6)  Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features indicated in subsections (1) through (5) above shall be so construed. Distances not specifically indicated on the official zoning map shall be determined by the scale of the map. 
(7)  Where physical features existing on the ground are at variance with those shown on the official zoning map or in other circumstances not covered by subsections (1) through (6) above, the city commission shall interpret the district boundaries. 
(8)  Where any street or alley is hereafter officially vacated or abandoned, the regulations applicable to each parcel of abutting property shall apply to that portion of such street of alley added thereto by virtue of such vacation or abandonment. 
Sec. 58-63. - Application of district regulations. 
    The regulations set by this article within each district shall be minimum regulations and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of structure of land. Except as otherwise provided in this article: 
(1)  No building, structure or land shall hereafter be used or occupied, and no building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in conformity with all the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is located. 
(2)  No building or other structure shall hereafter be erected or altered: 
a.  To exceed the height or bulk limitations; 
b.  To accommodate or house a greater number of families; 
c.  To occupy a greater percentage of lot area; 
d.  To have narrower or smaller rear yards, front yards, side yards or other open spaces; 
than herein required, or in any other manner contrary to the provisions of this article. 
(3)  No part of a yard or other open space or off-street parking or loading space required about or in connection with any building for the purpose of complying with this article shall be included as part of a yard, open space or off-street parking or loading space similarly required for any other building. 
(4)  No yard or lot existing at the time of passage of this article shall be reduced in dimension or area below the minimum requirements set forth herein. Yards or lots created after the effective date of this article shall meet at least the minimum requirements established by this article. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article to the contrary, no existing yard, lot, building site or parcel (or contiguous combination thereof) shall, without prior variance or subdivision approval, be sold, conveyed or subdivided, in whole or in part, in such a manner as to cause a residential or an accessory structure to be located in whole or in part within any setbacks required by the provisions of this article applicable to the zoning district in which that structure is located. No sale, conveyance or subdivision in violation of the above shall be recognized as valid for the purpose of issuance of building permits. 
(5)  All territory which may hereafter be annexed to the city shall be considered to continue to retain the zoning requirements of its prior governmental jurisdiction until an appropriate zoning district for the city can be established in accordance with the procedures outlined in this article. 
Sec. 58-64. - Nonconforming lots, nonconforming uses and nonconforming structures. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. 
(1)  Within the zoning districts established by this article or amendments that may later be adopted here exist: (a) lots; (b) structures, and (c) uses of land and structures which were lawful before this article was passed or amended but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this article or future amendment. It is the intent of this article that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or to allow uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
(2)  Nonconforming uses are incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. A nonconforming use of land or of a structure or in combination shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this article by attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district involved. 
(3)  To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this article shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption of amendment of this article and upon which actual building construction has been carried on diligently. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction provided that work shall be carried on diligently. 
(b)  Nonconforming lots of record. 
(1)  Notwithstanding any limitations as to frontage and total area imposed by any other provision of this article, any residential lots which were of record upon any recorded plat upon August 25, 1971, may be used to construct thereon a dwelling in conformity with the district provided (a) that such dwelling does not exceed a two-family residence as defined in this article, (b) that such lots shall have a minimum width throughout their length of at least 50 feet, (c) that any such dwelling shall conform to the requirements for the district in which it is located, (d) that wherever there may exist a residence which by itself or with accessory structures exists on a building site containing more than one platted lot of record, such building site shall not henceforth be reduced or diminished in dimension or area below the minimum requirements set forth in this article for the district in which it is located (regardless of whether the residence or accessory structures have been demolished, destroyed or removed from there, in whole or in part). 
(2)  If two or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage are under single ownership at any time after April 12, 1994, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements for lot width or area imposed by any other provision of this article, the lots involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this article, and no portion of such lot shall be used or sold which does not meet lot width and area requirements established by this article, nor shall any division of the parcel be made which leaves remaining any lot or parcel with width or area below the requirements stated in this article. 
(c)  Nonconforming structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this article that could not be built under the terms of this article by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, floor area ratio, its location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  No nonconforming structure or portion thereof may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, including enlargement of a structure or building into a required setback at any floor level (irrespective of the gross building area), but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity. 
(2)  If a nonconforming structure or portion thereof be demolished or destroyed through repair, remodeling, reconstruction or any other means to an extent of more than 50 percent of its replacement cost at the time of demolition or destruction, it shall not be reconstructed or restored except in conformity with the provisions of these zoning regulations. Removal and replacement of a nonconforming portion of a building with a new structure (such as new walls or roof) is not to be permitted. When 90 percent or more of the roof structure of a nonconforming building is removed, and interior floor areas are remodeled including the substantial removal of existing plumbing, electrical and mechanical systems, then that building shall be deemed to have exceeded the 50 percent destruction threshold referenced in this paragraph. 
(3)  If a nonconforming structure is to be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
(4)  Should such nonconforming structure be demolished, destroyed, or damaged by fire, wind storm, hurricane, tornado, flood, explosion, or other such calamity, such structure may be rebuilt or restored to its original dimensions and building setback as long as the nonconformities are not increased beyond the pre-existing condition and the building is rebuilt at same setback but not less than least five feet from the closest property line for those portions of the building which had nonconforming setbacks. 
(d)  Nonconforming uses of land, nonconforming structures or structures and land in combination. If lawful use involving land or individual structures or involving structures and land in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this article that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this article, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this article. 
(2)  No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this article. 
(3)  No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this article in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered, except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in its zoning district. 
(4)  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this article, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building. 
(5)  If any structure, or part of a structure, or a structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use exists, is then superseded by a permitted use, the structure, structure and land in combination or any part of the structure or land shall then thereafter conform to the regulations of its zoning district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. 
(6)  When a nonconforming use of land or a structure or land and structure in combination is discontinued for three consecutive months (except when governmental action impedes access to the premises), the land or structure or land and structure in combination shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. If a nonconforming use is discontinued or abandoned on a portion of the land or structure for three consecutive months, that portion of the land or structure shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. Land or structures shall not be deemed to be active and in continued nonconforming usage solely from the existence of a state license or local business tax receipt permitting such a use or business, but such use or business must be actively undertaken, staffed and in operation, unless other facts show legally sufficient activity, for such use or business to be deemed in active continued nonconforming usage. 
(7)  When the nonconforming use of a structure involves an accessory garage apartment or other accessory living unit, if such accessory use is not occupied by a tenant for six consecutive months, then the structure must be used in conformity with the regulations of its zoning district, unless such unit has been actively advertised for lease or purchase during the six-month period. 
(8)  Where nonconforming uses status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. Destruction for the purposes of this subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than 50 percent of the replacement cost at the time of destruction. 
(e)  Repairs and maintenance. 
(1)  On any nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs or repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing to an extent not exceeding ten percent of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of the structure, provided that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased. 
(2)  If a nonconforming structure becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to the lack of repairs and maintenance and is declared by any duly authorized official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
(3)  Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official. 
(f)  Special permit. 
(1)  The intent and purpose of this section is to recognize that there are limited and special circumstances where overall community and public policy objectives of the city encourage, and shall be served by, the continuation of some nonconforming uses and structures, provided said uses and structures are not detrimental to the surrounding neighborhood and to the community values established in the city's comprehensive plan and city codes. The city commission desires to establish specific standards for this category of special permit in order to allow the continuation of some nonconforming uses and structures notwithstanding any contrary provisions of this article or City Code. 
(2)  The city commission at a duly held public hearing may grant a special permit to allow the continuation of a nonconforming use or structure provided the following terms and conditions are strictly satisfied: 
a.  The owner of the property on which the nonconforming use or structure exists files a special permit application provided by the city; and 
b.  The applicant demonstrates that the continuation of the nonconforming use or structure: 
1.  Is capable of contributing in a positive way to the character and serves the need of the community, or reuse of buildings with architectural or historic value; and reuse of buildings that generate a significant necessary economic benefit to the community; and 
2.  Is compatible with, and not detrimental to, the surrounding neighborhood in terms of traffic, noise, parking, odor, light, intensity and land uses, hours of operation, landscaping, aesthetics, structural design, and density; and 
3.  Is consistent with the community values, objectives, and policies established in the city's comprehensive plan and City Code. 
(3)  The city commission may impose conditions and safeguards as a condition of approval of any special permit granted under this section and may also provide time limits and expiration of such special event. 
(Ord. No. 2796-10, § 1(Exh. A), 2-22-10; Ord. No. 3098-17 , § 9, 12-11-17) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2796-10, § 1(Exh. A), adopted Feb. 22, 2010, amended § 58-64 in its entirety as set out herein. The former § 58-64 pertained to similar subject matter. 
Sec. 58-65. - R-1AAA lakefront district. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. This district is established within the city to provide areas for single-family dwellings and necessary accessory buildings that minimize impacts on the lakes, which are among the city's greatest assets. The regulations enumerated for this district are designed to promote the construction of and continued use of land for a single-family dwelling and to provide as conditional uses certain structures and uses required to serve the residents, such as churches and noncommercial recreational area. Prohibited are uses of the land that would overburden public facilities or create impacts to adjacent lakes; thus, diminishing their water quality and aesthetic appeal. Areas zoned R-1AAA shall be those existing low-density residential areas adjacent to lakes or other water bodies, plus certain undeveloped areas whose development in a manner prescribed by this district would fulfill the intent of the comprehensive plan. 
(b)  Permitted uses. Detached single-family dwellings. 
(c)  Accessory uses permitted. Accessory buildings, including private garages to serve the residences, accessory living quarters which contain no cooking facilities, a recreation room, guesthouse, greenhouse, dock, boathouse, swimming pools, spas are permitted. Stormwater retention facilities servicing exclusively uses permitted in this district are permitted. In addition for properties which contain a residence that is 5,000 square feet in gross floor area or larger, a second kitchen may be included in a dwelling or cabana subject to not having a separate utility meter and not allowing this portion of the dwelling to be rented, let or hired out for occupancy whether compensations be paid directly or indirectly and subject to executing a deed restriction which outlines the above restrictions. That deed restriction shall be recorded prior to the issuance of the building permit and shall be removed only with the consent of the city. 
(d)  Conditional uses. The following uses may be permitted within this district only after review by the planning and zoning commission and approval by the city commission in accordance with provisions of this article: 
(1)  Churches or similar places of worship with necessary accessory structures, but not including mission or revival tents. Churches may not operate day nurseries, kindergartens or schools (grades 1-12) without first receiving conditional use approval for this use. 
(2)  Public parks, playgrounds, playing fields and neighborhood municipal recreation buildings and uses in keeping with the character and requirements of the district. 
(3)  Libraries, community centers and other public buildings. 
(4)  Tennis courts. 
(e)  Minimum building site. 
(1)  The minimum lot area for the R-1AAA lakefront district shall be 25,000 square feet with a minimum width at the building line, which is the front setback line of the main residence of 150 feet and a minimum frontage at the street and at the lake of 150 feet. 
(2)  The creation of new lakefront "flag" lots within this district shall be prohibited. Flag lots are any lot with dimensions at the street less than would exist at the building line front setback for the main residence. 
(f)  Site and building improvement regulations. 
(1)  Floor area ratio. 
a.  Limitations on allowable floor area are established for the following purposes: 
1.  To provide adequate living space for single-family dwellings; 
2.  To assure that the overall bulk and mass of all buildings on each site will be harmoniously related to the size of the building sites on which they are constructed; 
3.  To prevent out-of-scale developments that are inconsistent with the preservation of neighborhood character and open space. 
b.  Buildings and accessory structures constructed in the single-family zoning districts shall not exceed a gross floor area based on lot size as follows: 
1.  Properties with an area of 11,600 square feet or less shall use a maximum floor area ratio of 38 percent. 
2.  Properties with an area between 11,600 square feet to 13,600 square feet shall have a maximum gross floor area of 4,500 square feet. 
3.  Properties with an area larger than 13,600 square feet shall use a maximum floor area ratio of 33 percent. 
4.  Additional allowance for greater gross floor area may be permitted in accordance with the side setback standards in subsection 58-65(f)(6). 
c.  For one-story homes or homes with the second floor located within a sloping roof that has a roof slope of 12:12 or less, the allowable floor area ratio may be increased by up to five percent for properties less than 11,600 square feet in area or properties over 13,600 square feet in area. For homes utilizing this special allowance with lot areas between 11,600 to 13,600 square feet, a gross floor area of up to 5,200 square feet is permitted. Homes qualified to receive this additional special floor area allowance may provide roof dormers with a maximum width of eight feet, occupying up to 45 percent of the roof area within the same roof plane and the dormer(s) must be placed at least 2.5 feet back from the required setback of the home. In addition, one-story homes may utilize a maximum allowable impervious coverage of 60 percent. 
d.  Gross floor area shall be defined as the sum of the gross horizontal areas of the several floors of a building or buildings measured from the exterior surface of the walls or columns of open-roofed structures. Basement areas or other below-grade floor areas are excluded when more than one-half of that basement or floor height is below the established existing grade or curb level or edge of street when no curb is present. The area of stairways, elevators and multistory rooms or atriums shall be counted on each floor level. The area within carports, screened or roofed porches and balconies shall be counted, except those areas permitted to be excluded in this article and except as provided in the definitions for "gross floor area". 
e.  The area of screen pool enclosures shall not be counted in the floor area ratio. However, the area within screen pool enclosures shall not exceed eight percent of the lot area unless approved by the planning and zoning commission. Properties may exceed the eight percent limitation for screen pool enclosures without planning and zoning commission approval provided the total area of all structures, including screen pool enclosures, does not exceed the combination of the permitted floor area ratio and the eight percent of lot area. This approval shall insure that the screen enclosure and pool equipment is adequately set back, adequately buffered by landscaping, sufficiently designed to accommodate onsite retention, and appropriate in size and scale so as to negate any detriment to adjacent properties. 
f.  Floor area ratio on lakefront lots shall only be computed using the site area used for the building. Land area located across a street and separated from the building site shall not be included in the available land area calculation. 
g.  The gross floor area of a single-family building shall include the area of stairways, elevators, atriums, and volume ceiling spaces on each floor level, when such height would permit a floor level to exist with seven-and-one-half feet clearance. This is deemed to occur when the interior floor to ceiling height exceeds 171/2 feet. 
h.  The area within an open street front porch and entry may be excluded from the "gross floor area," subject to the limitations in this paragraph. This exclusion shall be limited to a maximum area of 400 square feet. The area on the first floor within an open or screened rear or open side porch, lanai, porte cochere or other covered area shall not be included within the "gross floor area." This exclusion shall be limited to a maximum area of 500 square feet. On the second floor, rear or side porches must have exterior sides that are 75 percent open in order to utilize up to 300 square feet of the total allowable 500 square feet of excludable gross floor area. An open front porch, entry area or porte cochere utilizing this exemption shall also comply with the provisions in subsection 58-65(f)(5)c. 
(2)  Impervious lot or site coverage. 
a.  Limitations on allowable impervious lot or site coverage are established for the following purposes: 
1.  To provide sufficient area on each building site for landscaping and open space; 
2.  To protect existing vegetation including trees; 
3.  To assure adequate percolation of rainfall into the soil thereby avoiding excessive erosion or runoff of water onto neighboring properties and promoting aquifer recharge. 
b.  Buildings, accessory structures, patios, decks, drives and other impervious surfaces shall not cover more than 50 percent of the total land area of the lot and at least 50 percent of the front yard area must consist of pervious surfaces with landscaping material. In any area of the front yard hard surfaces such as concrete, asphalt, brick, pavers or similar materials and driveways with stone or gravel may cover a maximum of 50 percent of the front yard area. Mulch drives are prohibited. The front yard area includes that area between the front lot line and the front wall(s) or front porch of the home. One-story homes may utilize a maximum impervious coverage of 60 percent. 

c.  Impervious lot or site coverage shall be defined as the percentage of the lot land area that is covered with impervious materials such as buildings, swimming pools, decks, patios, driveways, etc. Standard engineering coefficients of permeability may be utilized for mixed surfaces. 
d.  On lakefront lots, land located across a street and separated from the building site shall not be included in the available land area calculation. 
(3)  Building height. 
a.  Limitations on the maximum allowable height of structures are established for the following purposes: 
1.  To protect the value and enjoyment of neighboring properties by avoiding excessively massive buildings or buildings which dominate over neighborhood structures; 
2.  To preserve reasonable access to light, air and privacy for all properties; 
3.  To prevent the inequitable loss of private views or the unreasonable interference with significant public views resulting from excessively tall or poorly planned structures. 
b.  Height limits. The following limits shall apply to all height determinations in residential districts: 
1.  No building shall have more than two stories except as permitted in this section. Attic area above the second floor within a sloping roof with a maximum slope of 12:12 and within the allowed building height may be air conditioned and finished space and may be excluded from the gross floor area to be used in calculating the allowable floor area ratio. Homes with a mansard- or gambrel-roof types may not utilize this exception. This area shall also comply with the building code. 
2.  No building or portion thereof shall exceed 30 feet in height. Exception: homes with a roof slope of 8:12 or greater may be permitted to have two feet of additional building height. 

c.  Building height shall be defined as the vertical distance measured from the average elevation of the existing lot grade measured directly adjacent to the front of the building or proposed building. 
d.  Properties or lots with at least 80 feet of width at the building line are permitted building heights of 35 feet if the side setbacks are increased to 20 feet. Exception: homes with a roof slope of 8:12 or greater are permitted two feet of additional building height. 
e.  Properties or lots exceeding 50,000 square feet in size with at least 100 feet width at the building line may be permitted building heights of 40 feet if side setbacks are increased to 35 feet. 
f.  The special side setbacks referenced above shall be measured to the two-story roof component of the building over 30 feet in height. 
(4)  Setbacks. 
a.  Minimum setback standards are established for the following purposes: 
1.  To provide open space on each building site; 
2.  To assure a harmonious relationship of buildings on each site to the public right-of-way; 
3.  To protect access within building sites for emergency existing and fire protection access. 
4.  To protect trees by providing greater area for them. 
b.  Effect of setback standards. Setback standards define a yard area on the building site that is parallel and adjacent to the property line from which the setback is measured. Setbacks shall be maintained at not less than the minimum width specified by the setback standard. This minimum yard area shall be maintained as unoccupied space and shall be kept open and unobstructed from the ground upward along its full length and width. Required yard dimensions shall be measured between the property line of the building and that part of any structure or improvement nearest to the property line. 
c.  Second-story setbacks. For the purposes of determining required setbacks, a building wall that exceeds 12 feet in height above the natural grade to the wall plate shall be located on a lot so as to be in compliance with the setback requirements for the two-story portion of the building. In the case of a gable end or similar walls, the height shall be measured from the grade to the top plate at the bottom of the gable. Framed or trussed knee walls that add to the height of the wall shall be included when determining the allowable height of the wall. 
(5)  Front yard setbacks. 
a.  The front setback shall be the average of the adjacent two homes on each side of the subject property located on the same side of street. If one of the four homes is set back 50 percent greater or 50 percent less than the other three homes, then that larger or smaller setback number shall be removed from the average, and the front setback of the three remaining homes shall be used to determine the average. If the adjacent lot is vacant, then the next adjacent home shall be used for the front setback comparison. If the subject lot is a corner lot or one lot away from a corner, then the adjacent three homes shall be used to compute the setback. The front setback shall be measured to the front vertical wall of the home, however, when the adjacent homes have an open front porch qualifying as an open front porch under subsection 58-65(f)(5)c., the front setback measurement shall be made to a point five feet behind the porch column line, and the new home or addition utilizing this front setback average may not include a two-story structure or structural component in front of the main house wall of the existing adjacent homes. 

b.  The front setback shall be 25 feet when an average front setback has not been established as described above. 
c.  For an open front or street-side yard porch or entry, the front setbacks established above and the street-side yard setback on corner lots may be reduced by up to five feet in order to permit the addition of an open front porch or entry. Properties utilizing this exemption shall record a deed covenant outlining the restrictions precluding the screening or enclosing of such porch or entry. Open front porches or entry areas utilizing this setback exception shall have a maximum height of 12 feet from grade to the wall plate or to the top of the beam above the columns. The gable end walls on these porches may extend an additional maximum height of six feet. In order to exclude open front porches or entry areas from the floor area ratio, the exterior sides of these building elements must be approximately 75 percent open when measured from the floor to the underside of the opening with a maximum enclosed area of three feet above the opening to the wall plate or top of the support beam. 
d.  Notwithstanding the required or established front setback for a residence, no garage or carport shall be located so as to provide a front setback or street-side yard setback of less than 20 feet to the garage or carport opening. 
e.  See subsection 58-71(i)(3) for provisions on garages and carports. 
(6)  Side yard setbacks. 
a.  The side setback for one-story homes or the first floor of two-story homes is equal to 25 percent of the lot width in feet equally divided on each side of the home, except the side setback is 7.5 feet for lots which are 60 feet wide or less. 
b.  The side setback for two-story homes measured to the second story wall shall be 35 percent of the lot width in feet equally divided on each side of the home, except the second floor side setback is ten feet for lots which are 60 feet wide or less. 
c.  Special setbacks to allow increased floor area. In order to allow additional floor area for two-story homes, the required side setback on both floors must increase in feet by one percent of the lot width for each one percent increase in the allowable floor area up to a maximum allowable increase of five percent for properties less than 11,600 square feet in area or for properties over 13,600 square feet in area. 
For homes utilizing this special setback allowance with lot areas between 11,600 to 13,600 square feet, use 4,500 square feet of gross floor area as the allowable base area. This base area may be increased to a maximum of 5,200 square feet by increasing the side setback in increments of 140 square feet for each one-percent increase in the side setbacks until reaching the maximum of 5,200 square feet. For example, to allow a gross floor area of 4,640 square feet (4,500 + 140), the required side setbacks must be increased by one percent on both floors which is 26 percent of the lot width on the first floor and 36 percent on the second floor. 
Exception to allow five-percent increase in the floor area ratio for narrow lots: Lots which are 60 feet wide or less shall use a second floor setback of 12.5 feet or greater. 
d.  General side setback rules. The lot width is measured at the building line across the front of the existing or proposed home. The required setback must be rounded up to the next whole number when the required setback number is one-half foot or greater, and rounded down to the next whole number when the required setback is less than one-half foot. Lots over 200 feet in width shall use the required setback for lots which are 200 feet in width. 
e.  One- or two-story homes on lots over 60 feet and up to 110 feet in width which have a first floor side wall height of 11 feet or less measured from the natural grade to the top of the roof sheathing may utilize a side setback of ten feet to the first floor wall. To utilize this setback allowance, homes with a gable end side wall must limit the gable end width to 24 feet and the roof height to 24 feet. The side wall height of a gable end wall is measured from pre-construction existing grade to plate height or to a point 12 feet below the gable roof ridge, whichever is lower in elevation. One-story homes with a flat roof may utilize a side setback of ten feet when the maximum height of the roof is 13 feet. 
f.  The table below provides examples of the required side setbacks for various lot widths in accordance with paragraphs "a," "b," "c" and "d" above: 
Setbacks Based on % of lot width at 1st and 2nd floors using 25%-35%

g.  Special side setback option for narrow lots (65 feet wide or less) with rear parking areas or garages: Provide a side setback of 11 feet on one side to allow driveway access and provide a minimum setback of six feet on the other side with a side wall height limit of 11 feet measured from existing grade to the top of the roof sheathing and provide a second floor setback of ten feet; or as an alternate for lots 60 feet wide or less provide a minimum setback of eight feet to both floor walls on one side and a minimum setback of ten feet to both floor walls on the other (driveway) side. The driveway may utilize a side setback of one foot subject to not diverting drainage onto the neighboring property. The maximum allowed floor area ratio is permitted when using this option. 
h.  For lots with a front to rear sloping topography, an average side wall height of 12 feet measured from the natural or pre-existing site grade to the wall plate may be utilized at the required side setback. Walls averaging higher than 12 feet must be located at the required second floor setback. 
i.  Lot width is measured at the front building line across the lot. The building line is located at the required front setback for vacant home sites or properties being redeveloped and at the front building wall closest to the street of the existing homes. If an existing home has an open front porch or carport encroaching into the established front setback as determined above in paragraph (5), then the building line shall be determined to be located five feet behind the front support columns of the porch or carport. For unusual shaped lots such as pie-shaped lots that have a reducing or increasing width toward the rear of the lot, an average lot width may be utilized as measured between the front setback line and the required rear setback line. In addition, the lot width shall be determined by the building director for other unusual lot configurations. 
(7)  Rear yard setbacks. The rear setback shall be 25 feet to a one-story structure and 35 feet to the two-story portion of any building. The rear setback may be reduced to 25 feet from 35 feet for two-story components when those consist of a second-story loft or mezzanine that is within the normal scale and height (not to exceed 18 feet) of a typical one-story structure. 
The rear setback may be reduced to ten feet when the rear yard of the residential property abuts non-residentially zoned property or property zoned R-3 or R-4, State of Florida railroad property or a permanent stormwater retention area over 25 feet in width. 
(8)  Side wall articulation. Each side wall shall provide architectural articulation by stepping the wall plane in or out by at least two feet when the side wall plane and side roof line extend more than 36 feet along the side lot line. The articulation must be provided on one-story walls, on both floors for two-story-high walls, and on the first floor of two-story homes where the second floor is set back from the first floor by at least two feet and includes roof articulation unless the omission of roof line articulation is critical to maintain the architectural style of the home. The inset or projection must extend a distance of at least six feet along the side property line and may continue for another 36 feet of wall length before repeating the articulation. Projections designed to accomplish this articulation requirement must meet the required side setback. The minimum inset or projection is two feet. Bay windows, chimneys or imitation chimneys up to eight feet wide may be utilized to accomplish articulation and may extend up to two feet into the required side setback except where the permitted side setback is six feet or greater. See subsection 58-71(g) for additional chimney setback allowance. 
Alternate allowances for articulation: 
a.  For existing homes without articulation which have a side wall length of 48 feet or less, extending the existing side wall without articulation is permitted for a maximum additional distance of 12 feet for one-story homes. 
b.  A one-story side entry garage set back at least 24 feet from the side lot line with entry door(s) recessed at least eight inches from the plane of the garage wall that faces the side lot line. 
c.  Glazed openings covering over 25 percent of the side wall that provide relief in the mass of the wall area by recessing the plane of the glazed surface by at least two inches from the wall plane and with a maximum side wall length of 48 feet. 
d.  An open or screened porch having one side in line with the side wall plane or within two feet of the side wall plane at the rear of a one-story home with roof line articulation when the wall plane changes. 
e.  Articulation breaks of 12 inches in lieu of two feet including the roof line, combined with the use of contrasting materials with a minimum three-inch depth, such as brick, stone, siding or similar materials that provide relief in the mass of the wall. 

(9)  Special setback situations. 
a.  Special setbacks exist for corner lots and through lots that may impose more restrictive setbacks for principal and accessory structures, garages, swimming pools and other improvements. See subsection 58-71(h). 
b.  Flag lots shall observe a 20-foot setback from the property side parallel to the street on the side closest to the street. 
c.  Any residential construction on lots within 200 feet of the lake's edge or with canal frontage shall have the approval of the planning and zoning commission. The setback from the lake's edge for structures other than boathouses, docks, gazebos, or retaining walls shall be the average established by the adjacent lakefront properties within 200 feet of the subject property, or 50 feet, whichever is greater. The planning and zoning commission shall have the authority to approve lakefront and canal front setbacks less than the average to a minimum of 50 feet in accordance with their lakefront review authority. 
(g)  Nonconforming lots. Lots of record that have widths at the building line or frontages at the street or lake, or that have lot areas less than that required by this R-1AAA district shall also observe the following provision, in addition to those defined elsewhere in this article. 
(1)  When two or more adjoining lots of record with continuous frontage are in a single ownership on or any time after January 23, 1979, and such adjoining lots have a width at the building line or frontage at the street or lot areas less than is required by this R-1AAA district in which they are located, such lots shall be considered as one tract so as to create one or more lots which conform to, or more closely conform to the building line, frontage and area requirements of this district. 
(2)  Any single lot of record on January 23, 1979, may be used for a single-family dwelling, provided it has a minimum width at the building line of at least 50 feet. However, such a lot must not have been of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership on or at any time after January 23, 1979.

Sec. 58-66. - R-1AA and R-1A districts. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. These districts are established within the city to provide areas for single-family dwellings and necessary accessory buildings. The regulations enumerated for this district are designed to encourage and promote the construction of and the continued use of the land for single-family dwellings, to promote and encourage a suitable environment for family life, to prohibit uses of the land which would substantially interfere with development or continuation of single-family dwellings in the districts, and to prevent use of the land for purposes which would overburden the public facilities. Permitted as conditional uses within these districts will be certain structures and uses required to serve the residents such as public schools, churches and noncommercial recreational uses. Areas zoned for R-1AA and R-1A districts shall be those existing low-density residential areas plus certain undeveloped areas which should develop in a similar manner according to the comprehensive plan. 
(b)  Permitted uses. Detached single-family dwellings. 
(c)  Accessory uses permitted. Accessory buildings including private garages to serve the residences, accessory living quarters which contain no cooking facilities, a recreation room, guest house, greenhouse, dock boathouse, swimming pools, spas are permitted. Stormwater retention facilities servicing exclusively uses permitted in this district are permitted. In addition, for properties which contain a residence that is 5,000 square feet in gross floor area or larger, a second kitchen may be included in a dwelling or cabana subject to not having a separate utility meter and not allowing this portion of the dwelling to be rented, let or hired out for occupancy whether compensations be paid directly or indirectly and subject to executing a deed restriction which outlines the above restrictions. That deed restriction shall be recorded prior to the issuance of the building permit and shall be removed only with the consent of the city. 
(d)  Conditional uses. The following uses may be permitted within this district only after review by the planning and zoning commission and approval by the city commission in accordance with provisions of this article. 
(1)  Churches or similar places of worship with necessary accessory structures, but not including mission or revival tents. Churches may not operate day nurseries, kindergartens or schools (grades 1-12) without first receiving conditional use approval for this use; 
(2)  Public playgrounds, parks, playing fields and neighborhood municipal recreation buildings and uses in keeping with the character and requirements of the district; 
(3)  Libraries, community centers and other public buildings; 
(4)  Tennis courts; 
(5)  Affordable or workforce housing developments within a designated community redevelopment area (CRA). 
(e)  Minimum building site. 
(1)  The minimum lot area for the R-1AA district shall be 10,000 square feet with a minimum frontage at the building line of 100 feet. Corners lots shall have an extra ten feet of lot width required. 
(2)  The minimum lot area for the R-1A district shall be 8,500 square feet with a minimum frontage at the building line of 75 feet. Corners lots shall have an extra ten feet of lot width required. 
(3)  The minimum lot width for lakefront property located across a street from the principal lot with the main residence shall be the same lot width as is required for main residence. 
(f)  Site and building improvement regulations. 
(1)  Floor area ratio. 
a.  Limitations on allowable floor area are established for the following purposes: 
1.  To provide adequate living space for single-family dwellings; 
2.  To assure that the overall bulk and mass of all buildings on each site will be harmoniously related to the size of the building sites on which they are constructed; 
3.  To prevent out-of-scale developments that are inconsistent with the preservation of neighborhood character and open space. 
b.  Buildings and accessory structures constructed in the single-family zoning districts shall not exceed a gross floor area based on lot size as follows: 
1.  Properties with an area of 11,600 square feet or less shall use a maximum floor area ratio of 38 percent. 
2.  Properties with an area between 11,600 square feet to 13,600 square feet shall have a maximum gross floor area of 4,500 square feet. 
3.  Properties with an area larger than 13,600 square feet shall use a maximum floor area ratio of 33 percent. 
4.  Additional allowance for greater gross floor area may be permitted in accordance with the side setback standards in subsection 58-66(f)(6). 
c.  For one-story homes or homes with the second floor located within a sloping roof that has a roof slope of 12:12 or less, the allowable floor area ratio may be increased by up to five percent for properties less than 11,600 square feet in area or properties over 13,600 square feet in area. For homes utilizing this special allowance with lot areas between 11,600 to 13,600 square feet, a gross floor area of up to 5,200 square feet is permitted. Homes qualified to receive this additional special floor area allowance may provide roof dormers with a maximum width of eight feet, occupying up to 45 percent of the roof area within the same roof plane and the dormer(s) must be placed at least 2.5 feet back from the required setback of the home. In addition, one-story homes may utilize a maximum allowable impervious coverage of 60 percent. 
d.  Gross floor area shall be defined as the sum of the gross horizontal areas of the several floors of a building or buildings measured from the exterior surface of the walls or columns of open-roofed structures. Basement areas or other below-grade floor areas are excluded when more than one-half of that basement or floor height is below the established existing grade or curb level or edge of street when no curb is present. The area of stairways, elevators and multistory rooms or atriums shall be counted on each floor level. The area within carports, screened or roofed porches and balconies shall be counted, except those areas permitted to be excluded in this article and except as provided in the definitions for "gross floor area". 
e.  The area of screen pool enclosures shall not be counted in the floor area ratio. However, the area within screen pool enclosures shall not exceed eight percent of the lot area unless approved by the planning and zoning commission. Properties may exceed the eight percent limitation for screen pool enclosures without planning and zoning commission approval provided the total area of all structures, including screen pool enclosures, does not exceed the combination of the permitted floor area ratio and the eight percent of lot area. This approval shall insure that the screen enclosure and pool equipment is adequately set back, adequately buffered by landscaping, sufficiently designed to accommodate onsite retention, and appropriate in size and scale so as to negate any detriment to adjacent properties. 
f.  Floor area ratio on lakefront lots shall only be computed using the site area used for the building. Land area located across a street and separated from the building site shall not be included in the available land area calculation. 
g.  The gross floor area of a single-family building shall include the area of stairways, elevators, atriums, and volume ceiling spaces on each floor level, when such height would permit a floor level to exist with seven-and-one-half feet clearance. This is deemed to occur when the interior floor to ceiling height exceeds 171/2 feet. 
h.  The area within an open street front porch and entry may be excluded from the "gross floor area," subject to the limitations in this paragraph. This exclusion shall be limited to a maximum area of 400 square feet. The area on the first floor within an open or screened rear or open side porch, lanai, porte cochere or other covered area shall not be included within the "gross floor area." This exclusion shall be limited to a maximum area of 500 square feet. On the second floor, rear or side porches must have exterior sides that are 75 percent open in order to utilize up to 300 square feet of the total allowable 500 square feet of excludable gross floor area. An open front porch, entry area or porte cochere utilizing this exemption shall also comply with the provisions in subsection 58-65(f)(5)c. 
(2)  Impervious lot or site coverage. 
a.  Limitations on allowable impervious lot or site coverage are established for the following purposes: 
1.  To provide sufficient area on each building site for landscaping and open space; 
2.  To protect existing vegetation including trees; 
3.  To assure adequate percolation of rainfall into the soil thereby avoiding excessive erosion or runoff of water onto neighboring properties and promoting aquifer recharge. 
b.  Buildings, accessory structures, patios, decks, drives and other impervious surfaces shall not cover more than 50 percent of the total land area of the lot and at least 50 percent of the front yard area must consist of pervious surfaces with landscaping material. In any area of the front yard hard surfaces such as concrete, asphalt, brick, pavers or similar materials and driveways with stone or gravel may cover a maximum of 50 percent of the front yard area. Mulch drives are prohibited. The front yard area includes that area between the front lot line and the front wall(s) or front porch of the home. One-story homes may utilize a maximum impervious coverage of 60 percent. 

c.  Impervious lot or site coverage shall be defined as the percentage of the lot land area that is covered with impervious materials such as buildings, swimming pools, decks, patios, driveways, etc. Standard engineering coefficients of permeability may be utilized for mixed surfaces. 
d.  On lakefront lots, land located across a street and separated from the building site shall not be included in the available land area calculation. 
(3)  Building height. 
a.  Limitations on the maximum allowable height of structures are established for the following purposes: 
1.  To protect the value and enjoyment of neighboring properties by avoiding excessively massive buildings or buildings which dominate over neighborhood structures; 
2.  To preserve reasonable access to light, air and privacy for all properties; 
3.  To prevent the inequitable loss of private views or the unreasonable interference with significant public views resulting from excessively tall or poorly planned structures. 
b.  Height limits. The following limits shall apply to all height determinations in residential districts: 
1.  No building shall have more than two stories except as permitted in this section. Attic area above the second floor within a sloping roof with a maximum slope of 12:12 and within the allowed building height may be air conditioned and finished space and may be excluded from the gross floor area to be used in calculating the allowable floor area ratio. Homes with a mansard- or gambrel-roof types may not utilize this exception. This area shall also comply with the building code. 
2.  No building or portion thereof shall exceed 30 feet in height. Exception: homes with a roof slope of 8:12 or greater may be permitted to have two feet of additional building height. 

c.  Building height shall be defined as the vertical distance measured from the average elevation of the existing lot grade measured directly adjacent to the front of the building or proposed building. 
d.  Properties or lots with at least 80 feet of width at the building line are permitted building heights of 35 feet if the side setbacks are increased to 20 feet. Exception: homes with a roof slope of 8:12 or greater are permitted two feet of additional building height. 
e.  Properties or lots exceeding 50,000 square feet in size with at least 100 feet width at the building line may be permitted building heights of 40 feet if side setbacks are increased to 35 feet. 
f.  The special side setbacks referenced above shall be measured to the two-story roof component of the building over 30 feet in height. 
(4)  Setbacks. 
a.  Minimum setback standards are established for the following purposes: 
1.  To provide open space on each building site; 
2.  To assure a harmonious relationship of buildings on each site to the public right-of-way; 
3.  To protect access within building sites for emergency existing and fire protection access. 
4.  To protect trees by providing greater area for them. 
b.  Effect of setback standards. Setback standards define a yard area on the building site that is parallel and adjacent to the property line from which the setback is measured. Setbacks shall be maintained at not less than the minimum width specified by the setback standard. This minimum yard area shall be maintained as unoccupied space and shall be kept open and unobstructed from the ground upward along its full length and width. Required yard dimensions shall be measured between the property line of the building and that part of any structure or improvement nearest to the property line. 
c.  Second-story setbacks. For the purposes of determining required setbacks, a building wall that exceeds 12 feet in height above the natural grade to the wall plate shall be located on a lot so as to be in compliance with the setback requirements for the two-story portion of the building. In the case of a gable end or similar walls, the height shall be measured from the grade to the top plate at the bottom of the gable. Framed or trussed knee walls that add to the height of the wall shall be included when determining the allowable height of the wall. 
(5)  Front yard setbacks. 
a.  The front setback shall be the average of the adjacent two homes on each side of the subject property located on the same side of street. If one of the four homes is set back 50 percent greater or 50 percent less than the other three homes, then that larger or smaller setback number shall be removed from the average, and the front setback of the three remaining homes shall be used to determine the average. If the adjacent lot is vacant, then the next adjacent home shall be used for the front setback comparison. If the subject lot is a corner lot or one lot away from a corner, then the adjacent three homes shall be used to compute the setback. The front setback shall be measured to the front vertical wall of the home, however, when the adjacent homes have an open front porch qualifying as an open front porch under subsection 58-66(f)(5)c., the front setback measurement shall be made to a point five feet behind the porch column line, and the new home or addition utilizing this front setback average may not include a two-story structure or structural component in front of the main house wall of the existing adjacent homes. 

b.  The front setback shall be 25 feet when an average front setback has not been established as described above. 
c.  For an open front or street-side yard porch or entry, the front setbacks established above and the street-side yard setback on corner lots may be reduced by up to five feet in order to permit the addition of an open front porch or entry. Properties utilizing this exemption shall record a deed covenant outlining the restrictions precluding the screening or enclosing of such porch or entry. Open front porches or entry areas utilizing this setback exception shall have a maximum height of 12 feet from grade to the wall plate or to the top of the beam above the columns. The gable end walls on these porches may extend an additional maximum height of six feet. In order to exclude open front porches or entry areas from the floor area ratio, the exterior sides of these building elements must be approximately 75 percent open when measured from the floor to the underside of the opening with a maximum enclosed area of three feet above the opening to the wall plate or top of the support beam. 
d.  Notwithstanding the required or established front setback for a residence, no garage or carport shall be located so as to provide a front setback or street-side yard setback of less than 20 feet to the garage or carport opening. 
e.  See subsection 58-71(i)(3) for provisions on garages and carports. 
(6)  Side yard setbacks. 
a.  The side setback for one-story homes or the first floor of two-story homes is equal to 25 percent of the lot width in feet equally divided on each side of the home, except the side setback is 7.5 feet for lots which are 60 feet wide or less. 
b.  The side setback for two-story homes measured to the second story wall shall be 35 percent of the lot width in feet equally divided on each side of the home, except the second floor side setback is ten feet for lots which are 60 feet wide or less. 
c.  Special setbacks to allow increased floor area. In order to allow additional floor area for two-story homes, the required side setback on both floors must increase in feet by one percent of the lot width for each one percent increase in the allowable floor area up to a maximum allowable increase of five percent for properties less than 11,600 square feet in area or for properties over 13,600 square feet in area. 
For homes utilizing this special setback allowance with lot areas between 11,600 to 13,600 square feet, use 4,500 square feet of gross floor area as the allowable base area. This base area may be increased to a maximum of 5,200 square feet by increasing the side setback in increments of 140 square feet for each one-percent increase in the side setbacks until reaching the maximum of 5,200 square feet. For example, to allow a gross floor area of 4,640 square feet (4,500 + 140), the required side setbacks must be increased by one percent on both floors which is 26 percent of the lot width on the first floor and 36 percent on the second floor. 
Exception to allow five-percent increase in the floor area ratio for narrow lots: Lots which are 60 feet wide or less shall use a second floor setback of 12.5 feet or greater. 
d.  General side setback rules. The lot width is measured at the building line across the front of the existing or proposed home. The required setback must be rounded up to the next whole number when the required setback number is one-half foot or greater, and rounded down to the next whole number when the required setback is less than one-half foot. Lots over 200 feet in width shall use the required setback for lots which are 200 feet in width. 
e.  One- or two-story homes on lots over 60 feet and up to 110 feet in width which have a first floor side wall height of 11 feet or less measured from the natural grade to the top of the roof sheathing may utilize a side setback of ten feet to the first floor wall. To utilize this setback allowance homes with a gable end side wall must limit the gable end width to 24 feet and the roof height to 24 feet. The side wall height of a gable end wall is measured from pre-construction existing grade to plate height or to a point 12 feet below the gable roof ridge, whichever is a lower in elevation. One-story homes with a flat roof may utilize a side setback of ten feet when the maximum height of the roof is 13 feet. 
f.  The table below provides examples of the required side setbacks for various lot widths in accordance with paragraphs "a," "b," "c" and "d" above:

g.  Special side setback option for narrow lots (65 feet wide or less) with rear parking areas or garages: Provide a side setback of 11 feet on one side to allow driveway access and provide a minimum setback of six feet on the other side with a side wall height limit of 11 feet measured from existing grade to the top of the roof sheathing and provide a second floor setback of ten feet or as an alternate for lots 60 feet wide or less, provide a minimum setback of eight feet to both floor walls on one side and a minimum setback of ten feet to both floor walls on the other (driveway) side. The driveway may utilize a side setback of one foot subject to not diverting drainage onto the neighboring property. The maximum allowed floor area ratio is permitted when using this option. 
h.  For lots with a front to rear sloping topography, an average side wall height of 12 feet measured from the natural or pre-existing site grade to the wall plate may be utilized at the required side setback. Walls averaging higher than 12 feet must be located at the required second floor setback. 
i.  Lot width is measured at the front building line across the lot. The building line is located at the required front setback for vacant home sites or properties being redeveloped and at the front building wall closest to the street of the existing homes. If an existing home has an open front porch or carport encroaching into the established front setback as determined above in paragraph (5), then the building line shall be determined to be located five feet behind the front support columns of the porch or carport. For unusual shaped lots such as pie-shaped lots that have a reducing or increasing width toward the rear of the lot, an average lot width may be utilized as measured between the front setback line and the required rear setback line. In addition, the lot width shall be determined by the building director for other unusual lot configurations. 
(7)  Rear yard setbacks. The rear setback shall be 25 feet to a one-story structure and 35 feet to the two-story portion of any building. The rear setback may be reduced to 25 feet from 35 feet for two-story components when those consist of a second-story loft or mezzanine that is within the normal scale and height (not to exceed 18 feet) of a typical one-story structure. 
The rear setback may be reduced to ten feet when the rear yard of the residential property abuts non-residentially zoned property or property zoned R-3 or R-4, State of Florida railroad property or a permanent stormwater retention area over 25 feet in width. [See subsection 58-66(f)(9) for special reduced rear and front setbacks on certain lots with shallow depths of 105 feet or less.] 
(8)  Side wall articulation. Each side wall shall provide architectural articulation by stepping the wall plane in or out by at least two feet when the side wall plane and side roof line extend more than 36 feet along the side lot line. The articulation must be provided on one-story walls, on both floors for two-story-high walls, and on the first floor of two-story homes where the second floor is set back from the first floor by at least two feet and includes roof articulation unless the omission of roof line articulation is critical to maintain the architectural style of the home. The inset or projection must extend a distance of at least six feet along the side property line and may continue for another 36 feet of wall length before repeating the articulation. Projections designed to accomplish this articulation requirement must meet the required side setback. The minimum inset or projection is two feet. Bay windows, chimneys or imitation chimneys up to eight feet wide may be utilized to accomplish articulation and may extend up to two feet into the required side setback except where the permitted side setback is six feet or greater. See subsection 58-71(g) for additional chimney setback allowance. 
Alternate allowances for articulation: 
a.  For existing homes without articulation which have a side wall length of 48 feet or less, extending the existing side wall without articulation is permitted for a maximum additional distance of 12 feet for one-story homes. 
b.  A one-story side entry garage set back at least 24 feet from the side lot line with entry door(s) recessed at least eight inches from the plane of the garage wall that faces the side lot line. 
c.  Glazed openings covering over 25 percent of the side wall that provide relief in the mass of the wall area by recessing the plane of the glazed surface by at least two inches from the wall plane and with a maximum side wall length of 48 feet. 
d.  An open or screened porch having one side in line with the side wall plane or within two feet of the side wall plane at the rear of a one-story home with roof line articulation when the wall plane changes. 
e.  Articulation breaks of 12 inches in lieu of two feet including the roof line, combined with the use of contrasting materials with a minimum three-inch depth, such as brick, stone, siding or similar materials that provide relief in the mass of the wall. 

(9)  Special setback situations. 
a.  Lots with short lot depth. Lots with an average depth of 75 feet or less may utilize a ten-foot rear setback to a one-story structure and a 25-foot rear setback to the two-story portion of any building. Properties with an average lot depth of 105 feet or less may utilize a 15-foot rear setback to a one-story structure and a 30-foot rear setback to the two-story portion of any building. Any front facing garage opening must be set back at least 20 feet. 
b.  Special setbacks exist for corner lots and through lots that may impose more restrictive setbacks for principal and accessory structures, garages, swimming pools and other improvements. See subsection 58-71(h). 
c.  Flag lots shall observe a 20-foot setback from the property side parallel to the street on the side closest to the street. 
d.  Any residential construction on lots within 200 feet of the lake's edge or with canal frontage shall have the approval of the planning and zoning commission. The setback from the lake's edge for structures other than boathouses, docks, gazebos, or retaining walls shall be the average established by the adjacent lakefront properties within 200 feet of the subject property, or 50 feet, whichever is greater. The planning and zoning commission shall have the authority to approve lakefront and canal front setbacks less than the average to a minimum of 50 feet in accordance with their lakefront review authority. 
(g)  Affordable or workforce housing developments. 
(1)  The city may permit, within any designated community redevelopment area (CRA), as a conditional use, the use of land and buildings in this district as affordable or workforce housing developments. These developments shall be restricted to the use as independent households or living units including kitchens and all other normal amenities. This shall not include any use of these households or living units as an adult congregate living facility or any other type of assisted living facility where services are provided for food shopping, meal preparation, cleaning, laundry, nursing care, etc. The city commission may place conditions upon such conditional use approvals including conformance to operational, maintenance and management regulations. 
(2)  Each affordable or workforce housing unit shall have no less than 750 square feet and no more than 1,000 square feet of living area. Such units may be developed as independent detached buildings or as attached units of no more than three units in any building. No building shall be more than one story in height. 
(3)  The collective size or square footage of buildings developed as affordable or workforce housing shall not exceed the applicable floor area ratio for such property. Buildings developed as affordable or workforce housing shall meet all other applicable single-family zoning requirements, except that the city commission may approve buildings with only one parking space per unit and/or utilizing a ten-foot rear building setback. 
(4)  Prior to the issuance of a building permit for the development of affordable or workforce housing, as approved via conditional use, the property owner shall record a deed restriction and covenant running with title to the land, the text of which shall be approved by the city attorney, restricting the use of the property as follows: 
a.  Affordable housing shall be restricted such that with regard to a unit for sale, it must be sold for less than 80 percent of the median price of the single-family homes sold the previous year in the Orlando metropolitan area, and with regard to units for rent, the unit must rent monthly for less than 80 percent of the median monthly cost of similar sized one-bedroom units for the previous year in the Orlando metropolitan area. 
b.  Affordable housing shall be restricted such that the tenants or purchasers shall not have annual incomes in excess of 80 percent of the median annual family income for the Orlando metropolitan area. 
c.  Workforce housing shall be restricted such that with regard to a unit for sale, it must be sold for less than 120 percent of the median price of the single-family homes sold the previous year in the Orlando metropolitan area, and with regard to units for rent, the unit must rent monthly for less than 120 percent of the median monthly cost of similar-sized one-bedroom units for the previous year in the Orlando metropolitan area. 
d.  Workforce housing shall be restricted as affordable housing such that the tenants or purchasers shall not have annual incomes in excess of 120 percent of the median annual family income for the Orlando metropolitan area. 
e.  These deed restrictions and covenants shall run with the land to successors in title to the property and may only be removed with the consent of the city. 
f.  These restrictions and covenants shall also require the property owner to provide to the city any information including copies of leases, contracts and other data to ascertain compliance with these conditions regarding the use of the property as elderly housing sold or rented as affordable housing. 
g.  These restrictions and covenants shall also require that the property owner of an elderly affordable housing development provide to the city an annual report outlining compliance with city codes regarding the maintenance and upkeep of the grounds, landscaping, buildings and parking lot. 
h.  These restrictions and covenants shall also require that the property owner convert such property to a single-family use (notwithstanding any nonconforming setbacks) in conformance with the R-1A or R-1AA zoning if such project fails to comply with these requirements for affordable housing.

Sec. 58-67. - Low density residential (R-2) district. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. 
(1)  Certain areas within the city are suitable for low-density residential development, but are not suitable for multiple-family development. These areas possess at least one of the following characteristics: 
a.  Areas of the city in which a mix of housing types is compatible with existing development; 
b.  Areas in which low density residential development presently exists; 
c.  Areas in which imposition of R-1A, or R-1AA, or R-1AA standards would impose a hardship upon persons desiring to build a single family residence; and 
d.  Areas in which a small tract of land would lend itself to clustering of units in such a way that a unified development is accomplished which would not adversely affect adjacent residential properties. 
(b)  Permitted uses. 
(1)  Single-family residences. 
(2)  Duplexes. 
(3)  Principal dwellings and cottage dwellings. 
(c)  Accessory uses permitted. Accessory buildings including private garages to serve the residences, a recreation room, and guesthouse only when a single-family dwelling exists on the property, greenhouse, dock, boathouse, swimming pools, and spas. Stormwater retention facilities serving exclusively uses that are permitted in this district. 
(d)  Redevelopment of existing buildings. Properties which have existing single family residences, duplexes and/or existing detached garages may be modified or enlarged in accordance with the following standards: 
(1)  An existing single family dwelling being enlarged or an existing duplex being converted to a single family dwelling may be enlarged along existing nonconforming setbacks for one-story or two-story additions subject to obtaining a letter of approval from all property owners abutting the side of the subject property with the nonconforming setback where the addition(s) are planned and subject to a minimum setback of five feet from the side or rear lot lines. 
(2)  An existing garage or accessory building may be enlarged along existing nonconforming setbacks for the purpose of adding a one-story or two-story cottage dwelling addition or garage subject to obtaining a letter of approval from all property owners abutting the side or the rear of the subject property with the nonconforming setback where the addition(s) are planned and subject to a minimum setback of five feet from the side or rear lot lines. 
(3)  Except where utilizing the setback redevelopment standards in subsections (1) and (2) above, all other development standards for these redeveloping properties shall conform to the standards in subsection (f), General development standards. 
(4)  The letter of approval referenced in subsections (1) and (2) above must include information describing the use, height, size and setbacks of the proposed building addition, and this procedure for an administrative variance shall not preclude the property owner from applying for a variance through the board of adjustment. 
(e)  Conditional uses. The following uses may be permitted as conditional uses only after review by the planning and zoning commission and approval by the city commission in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(1)  Any conditional use as listed in the R-1AA and R-1A Districts. 
(2)  Cluster housing, but not including garden apartments or density in a single building greater than defined for this use. Cluster housing on property, which is abutting or across the street from single family zoned property shall utilize a maximum floor area ratio of 45 percent. Cluster housing on property which is abutting single family zoned property shall provide the same rear yard setback as required in the abutting single family zoned property, except where the abutting single family zoned property is not used for residential purposes, such as churches, parks, community centers, etc. 
Appearance review shall be conducted during the cluster housing application process to ensure compatibility with surrounding neighborhoods and to encourage the development of traditional building elevations with low density single family residential appearance while allowing flexibility of building design and site layout. The intent of the appearance review is to apply the basic design considerations described below in a manner, which meets the criteria while allowing a variety of architectural styles. Specific architectural types shall not be mandated, but rather many housing styles are encouraged while minimizing any negative impacts, such as large building mass next to smaller buildings on surrounding properties. Extremely unusual styles, not prevalent in the city, shall be prohibited. They shall include but are not limited to: dome houses, homes constructed of cast in place concrete with exposed unfinished walls, pyramid homes, and similar unusual styles unless approved as part of the conditional use. 
The following parameters shall provide objective guidelines for preparing building plans for approval under the appearance review process: 
Building(s) layout: Each site must provide a layout, which maintains the scale of a single family dwelling with attention to yards and open space. 
Location and adequacy of parking: Parking must located to the side and rear of the main dwellings with access from the rear through a private driveway or alley where possible. 
Exterior building finish: All finishes must be traditional siding, clapboard, stucco (or similar coating material), brick, cedar shakes (or similar alternate), finished block, board and battens, stone or combinations of these finishes. 
Roof shape: Roof patterns must be traditional standard shapes such as gable, hip, shed, gambrel, or flat with parapet walls. 
Fenestration: Window and door openings must blend with and be in balance with architecture of the building and not undersized or oversized for any street front elevation, such as a small, out of scale window next to a larger window. 
Porch/Balcony: Open porches or covered entry ways must be located on the street front side of the building with a minimum porch depth of seven feet for those cluster dwellings with street front locations. Balconies may project into a required setback by 3.5 feet. 
Building elevations: All street fronting elevations must provide approximately 15 percent window openings and provide a main entry for dwelling units with a street front location. 
Height of building: The relationship of the height of buildings to that of nearby structures shall be taken into consideration through designs which utilize stepped down roof areas if the new buildings are located among homes with one-story or lower building heights. However, the design may utilize the height allowed under the development standards. 
Use of impervious coverage: In achieving the 65 percent allowable impervious coverage, use of pervious paving materials may be utilized to enhance stormwater retention to the extent permitted by the city stormwater engineer. However, use of these materials shall not reduce the provision of landscaping on at least 25 percent of the property. 
Landscaping: All sides of property along street frontages shall be landscaped. The landscape plan shall be prepared by a licensed design professional and shall be submitted to the city for review and approval. 
Tree canopy and protection: Unless additional restrictions are imposed by the planning and zoning commission or city commission during the public review process, arbor control shall be regulated by the tree ordinance in section 58-281 et seq. 
Waste containers: Use of individual waste disposal containers shall be required, except that large solid waste containers may only be used for developments utilizing four units per building or larger. When large solid waste containers are provided, a decorative enclosure shall be provided so as to blend in with the architecture of the buildings. 
Alternative materials or designs may be considered during the appearance review process. 
(3)  Adult congregate living facilities. 
(4)  Tennis courts. 
(5)  Non-profit educational facilities, deemed non-profit pursuant to IRS standards, limited to locations within the central business district, provided that the proposed use enables an appropriate adaptive reuse of a historic landmark building such that the historic character of the building is preserved for the duration of its new function. Buildings eligible for consideration include those buildings listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places as shown on the most recent Winter Park Architectural Survey and National Register Evaluation, or that represent a designated historic landmark of exceptional local significance as determined by the Winter Park Historic Preservation Commission. A use that would require modifications to the building or site shall be locally designated and receive a certificate of review under sections 58-457 through 58-478. In addition any such approval must meet the general conditional use requirements and the standards for consideration contained in subsection 58-86(i). 
(6)  Child care centers which are operated by a non-profit educational institution. The location of such use may not have ingress and egress onto a street which serves primarily residential traffic. The proposed CUP must specifically address traffic impacts, parking, playground noise and hours of operation.

All such visitor parking spaces shall be clearly marked on the pavement or have signage provided, indicating their use for visitor parking. In cases where there is restricted access security or gates for resident parking, then such restricted access security or gates, etc., shall not prohibit access to the required number of visitor parking spaces. Parking necessary for on-site management or other on-site employees shall be provided in parking spaces in excess of the number required as visitor parking. The city's code enforcement board may enforce these provisions when it is witnessed by city staff that on any four consecutive occasions within any two consecutive day period, the same resident vehicle or management employee vehicle is utilizing any designated visitor parking spaces. Two car garages utilized to meet the parking requirements shall be a minimum size of 22 × 22 feet. 
(8)  Except within the central business district geographical area, multi-family residential development within areas designated R-3, shall not exceed two stories in height unless approved via conditional use by the city commission.

Sec. 58-70. - Planned unit residential development (PURD) district. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. 
(1)  The planned unit residential development (PURD) district is established to encourage the development of large tracts of land as planned residential areas which provide a more varied and interesting urban pattern and are capable of incorporating new demands in the housing market and changes in design and technology in the building industry. 
(2)  Further, the objectives of the PURD district include: 
a.  To provide a more desirable living environment than would be possible through the strict application of article requirements; 
b.  To encourage developers to use a more creative approach in the development of land; 
c.  To encourage a more efficient allocation and maintenance by private initiative of common open spaces within new residential areas; 
d.  To encourage variety in the physical development pattern of the city; 
e.  To provide for more efficient use of those public facilities and utilities required in connection with the new residential development; 
f.  To encourage a variety of dwelling and building types within a neighborhood area; and 
g.  To place emphasis on the density of dwelling units per acre rather than on minimum lot sizes, thereby permitting and encouraging a developer to preserve scenic and natural amenities. 
(b)  Permitted uses. The uses permitted within this district shall be primarily residential in character, and may include the following: 
(1)  Single family detached dwellings; 
(2)  Duplex townhouses or cluster housing but excluding garden apartments or density in a single building beyond that defined in this article; 
(3)  Multiple-family dwellings provided, however, in no case shall the building height as defined in this article exceed 35 feet. Parapet walls or mechanical equipment and related structures may be added to the building height but in no case shall extend more than five feet above the height limitation established in this section; 
(4)  Parks and recreational areas; 
(5)  Churches. 
(c)  Development requirements and standards for approval. 
(1)  The parcel for which a PURD is proposed must be compact in shape and be in a single ownership or control. The parcel must be a minimum of two acres in size, unless provided an exception by the city commission. 
(2)  The overall density of development permitted on this tract shall not exceed five units per acre for properties designated as single-family in the comprehensive plan except in the approved PURD areas where the density of single-family, zero lot line or townhouse development may be increased to eight units per acre or ten units per acre for properties designated as low density or multi-family in the comprehensive plan. This calculation shall not include the land areas to be dedicated to the city as road rights-of-way or storm water retention areas necessary for those road rights-of-way. The residential units permitted in this district may be provided by a mixture of housing types provided that the number of multi-family units does not exceed 50 percent of the total residential units; the remaining units shall include cluster housing, attached and detached single family residences. 
(3)  Minimum land area per residential unit: 
Single family detached ..... 5,000 sq. ft. 
Cluster housing/townhouse ..... 2,500 sq. ft. 
Multiple-family unit ..... 1,500 sq. ft. 
(4)  Minimum land area per residential unit reserved in common open space: 
Single family detached ..... 1,000 sq. ft. 
Townhouse/cluster housing ..... 2,000 sq. ft. 
Multiple-family unit ..... 2,500 sq. ft. 
(Required stormwater retention areas shall not be counted toward meeting this requirement.) 
(5)  Minimum living area per residential unit: 
Single family detached ..... 1,500 sq. ft. 
Cluster house ..... 1,200 sq. ft. 
Townhouse ..... 1,000 sq. ft. 
Multiple-family unit ..... 750 sq. ft. 
(6)  There shall be no minimum setbacks, no minimum percentage of lot coverage and no minimum lot widths unless otherwise stated in this section. However, the location of proposed structures shall be shown on the development plan and the development of the PURD shall be subject to the minimum lot size, setback lines, lot coverage or floor area, specified in the approved plan. The proposed location arrangement of structures shall not be detrimental to existing or proposed adjacent dwellings or to the development of the neighborhood. 
(7)  When development standards are not proposed and adopted that are different than the applicable single family or low density building and accessory structure requirements, the regulations of this article shall apply. 
(8)  A minimum of two off-street parking spaces shall be provided for each residential unit in the planned unit residential development. For single family attached and detached houses, these spaces shall be provided on each residential lot; for the multiple-family units, parking may be provided in small parking areas adjacent to the units served. 
(9)  All streets within the PURD shall meet all the requirements outlined in the city's subdivision regulations. 
(10)  The common open space and recreational areas may be deeded to the city for general public use. If the city does not accept this land or the developer elects not to offer the areas for general public use, the developer of the PURD shall provide a legally constituted homeowners association which owns and maintains this common open space property. The legal instruments of this association shall be reviewed and shall be acceptable to the city commission. If the property is owned by such an association, this property shall be subject to the city ad valorem taxes. The legal instrument creating this association shall be approved by the city commission. 
(11)  The perimeter of the planned unit residential development shall contain a buffer or setback strip of 50 feet to any adjacent private property, if the development includes any building over 30 feet in height. Otherwise a buffer or setback strip of 20 feet shall be provided. When a development contains buildings of differing heights, the buffer or setback strip shall be determined by the height of the building closest to the adjacent private property. No buildings, parking lots or other structures may be located within this area. However, swimming pools and pool decks may be permitted in these buffer areas subject to the normal residential setback requirements. The planning and zoning commission may recommend and the city commission may approve the erection of a fence or wall or the location of other buildings or structures within this buffer area if it is located adjacent to a public street and if those buildings or structures are consistent with the character of the surrounding area or as deemed appropriate to protect the privacy and amenities of the adjacent existing uses. This buffer area may be included in the required open space, but is not required to be, if this land is open to common use and not fenced for the private use of the adjacent residential unit. 
(12)  After the completion of a planned unit residential development, the use of the land and the construction, modification or alteration of any buildings or structures within the area covered by the plan shall be regulated by the approved development plan which shall be retained in the office of the building and zoning department of the city. 
(13)  No changes may be made in the approved development plan except as provided below: 
a.  Minor extensions, alterations or modifications of existing buildings or structures may be permitted after review and approval by the building official provided they are substantially consistent with the purposes and intent of the development plan. 
b.  Substantial change in permitted uses, location of buildings or other specifications of the development plan may be permitted, but only after public hearing and approval by the city commission upon receipt of the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission. 
(d)  Review and approval procedure. An application for a PURD shall be considered administratively as a petition for rezoning and will be subject to those procedures established in this article. Because of the nature of this district, additional procedures and requirements must be required; these are outlined in the following paragraphs. The application and additional supportive data shall be submitted to the building official. 
(1)  Pre-application conference. The applicant for a PURD is encouraged to confer with the city's administrative staff prior to submitting a formal application to discuss the general concept of the plan and to obtain information regarding projected programs and other matters of the city which might affect the development.

3.  The adequacy of existing and proposed streets, utilities, and other public services to serve the development; 
4.  The character, design and appropriateness of the proposed land uses and their adequacy to encourage desirable living conditions, to provide separation and screening between uses where desirable to preserve the natural amenities of the land; and 
5.  The adequacy of open space areas and recreation facilities within the PURD. If a PURD district is approved, the building official shall change the zoning map to designate the appropriate PURD district and the date of approval. Planned unit residential developments shall also be subject to approval by the city commission receiving upon the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission of a comprehensive development plan (which shall substantially comply with the approved concept plan) prior to issuance of permits or authorization of development. 
(3)  Comprehensive development plan. The application shall be supported by a development plan and a written summary of intent, and shall show the relation between the proposed development and the surrounding area, both existing and proposed. The following information shall also be presented for review: 
a.  A general location map; 
b.  Existing topographic conditions, including contour intervals of one foot based on field surveys or photogrammetric methods; 
c.  The existing and proposed land uses and the proposed location of all buildings or structures in the PURD;

i.  Perspective drawings of representative building types except for detached single-family dwellings and their accessory buildings. These drawings should indicate general architectural type and appearance; and 
j.  If a proposed development creates special problems or involves unusual circumstances or if the planning and zoning commission desires additional information to more adequately evaluate the proposal, such data may be required. Examples include an off-street parking and loading plan, an economic feasibility report or market analysis, a traffic study and circulation plan for the area or any other information needed. 
(4)  Development report. The applicant shall submit a written statement with the plan that shall include the following information: 
a.  A state of the present ownership of all land within the proposed development; 
b.  An explanation of the character of the PURD, including a summary of acres for each use, the number of dwelling units and the gross density by type of land use. The statement shall include standards for floor area ratio, lot size, yard and spacing requirements for each type of dwelling unit. In the event any standards are not included in the development report, the applicable zoning standards for the single family, cluster housing or multi-family housing shall be utilized. This shall apply to the principal structure as well as any accessory structures such as swimming pools, fences, walls, etc. 
c.  A general statement of the proposed development schedule and progression of unit division or staging; 
d.  Statement giving the proposed ownership of the multiple-family units; and 
e.  Agreements, provisions and covenants which govern the use, maintenance, and protection of the development of common or open areas where public dedication is not contemplated. 
(5)  Staff review. After all required information has been received, the administrative staff of the city will have 30 days to review it. During this time, the staff may require the applicant to provide additional information which it deems necessary to adequately consider the comprehensive development plan. 
(6)  Public hearings. After this review period, the planning and zoning commission and city commission will hold public hearings. The administrative staff will present its recommendations to the commissions at these hearings. Approval of the comprehensive development plan will be contingent upon its conformance to the approved preliminary concept plan. 
(7)  Subdivision plan. The applicant may file a preliminary subdivision plan with the development plan in order that tentative approval of the subdivision may be granted by the planning and zoning commission. In no case, however, shall subdivision approval precede approval of the development plan. The building official shall issue building permits for structures in the area covered by the approved comprehensive development plan if they are in substantial conformity with the approved preliminary concept plan, the development schedule, and with all other applicable regulations. If the developer questions the building official, the matter will be resolved by the planning and zoning commission. 
(8)  Revision of comprehensive development plan. Any major or substantial changes in the approved comprehensive development plan which affects the intent and character of the development, the land use pattern and density, the location or dimensions of streets or structures, or similar substantial changes shall be reviewed and approved by the city commission subsequent to the receipt of the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission. A request for a revision of the comprehensive development plan shall be supported by a written statement of why the revisions are necessary or desirable. The planning and zoning commission or city commission may require any additional supportive data they deem necessary. 
(9)  Duration of approval. Approval by the city commission shall be for one year or the submitted development schedule. If no construction has begun within one year after approval of the development plan, or if the applicant fails to maintain the approved development schedule, the approval of the comprehensive development plan shall lapse and be of no further effect. If the approval of the comprehensive development plan lapses under this provision the comprehensive development plan shall automatically be removed from the official zoning map and the area shall automatically revert back to the zoning district which applied to the area prior to the approval of the comprehensive development plan. The city clerk shall also file a notice of revocation with the recorded comprehensive development plan. 
(e)  Approved development plan standards for approved PURDs.

Sec. 58-71. - General provisions for residential zoning districts. 
(a)  Suitability of buildings. Any proposed building shall be considered as to its suitability of design and type of construction in relation to the district and to the immediate neighborhood site, and if such design or construction is markedly incongruous with the character of such neighborhood as to be detrimental to the value of adjacent or nearby properties, then the code enforcement director shall deny the application for a building permit. 
(b)  Grading of building site. 
(1)  Every lot which is used for a building site shall be so graded that it will be dry and free from standing water and the grade around the walls of every new building at the point where the sill meets these walls shall not be less than 12 inches above the crown line established or to be established for the street on which such a building faces, unless the lot has drainage away from the street to the lake or canal or has other adequate means of drainage as may be checked and approved by the city engineer at the request of the city building director. If the street on which the lot faces has a slope between lot lines, an elevation half-way between the high and low points is to be used for determining the height of crown line. 
(2)  No lot owner shall grade his lot in such a way as to interfere with the natural drainage of adjoining lots or divert the drainage of his lot onto adjoining lots nor to interfere with the natural drainage of any lot so that the drainage of such lot is diverted upon any public street or thoroughfare in such a manner or in such amounts as to flood such public street or thoroughfare. 
(c)  Architectural towers, spires, chimneys, or other architectural appendages, etc. 
(1)  Any architectural tower, spire, chimney, flag pole or other architectural appendage to a building shall conform to that districts height limit. However, when necessary to meet the building code requirements, chimneys may exceed the height by that minimum required distance. One flag pole may be placed on a residential lot or parcel subject to a height limit of five feet less than the permitted building height and located in front of the home encroaching up to ten feet into the front setback and not within the required side and rear yard setbacks established for the subject property. 
(2)  Architectural appendages, embellishments and other architectural features may be permitted to exceed the roof heights specified in that section, except on one- or two-family buildings on a limited basis encompassing no more than 30 feet of the building roof length and area, up to eight feet of additional height upon approval of the city commission, based on a finding that said features are compatible with adjacent projects. For any such approval not part of a conditional use request the planning and zoning commission will review the plans at a public hearing after notification of such request is mailed to all owners of property within 500 feet. The planning and zoning commission will make a recommendation to the city commission for their final decision. 
(d)  Parking of commercial vehicles in residential districts. 
(1)  The regular or constant parking of commercial vehicles or vehicles used primarily for commercial purposes, or vehicles having outside lettering larger than three square feet in area per side displaying information identifying a business, product or service, including trucks (with a rated capacity over one ton), semi-trailers, truck tractors or any combination thereof or any other truck or special mobile equipment or heavy equipment, building materials and other similar materials is not permitted within the residential zoning districts. (R-1AAA, R-1AA, R-1A, R-2, R-3, R-4 or PURD). 
(2)  Exceptions. The provision of this section shall not apply to: 
a.  Property where construction is underway for which a current and valid building permit has been issued by the city, as to those vehicles and equipment actively engaged in such construction; 
b.  Those vehicles and equipment being used to perform lawful work upon the premises where the vehicle is parked, including immediate pick-up or delivery service; 
c.  Any vehicle, with a capacity rating under 10,000 pounds that is parked entirely inside a garage and not visible from the street or from surrounding properties; 
d.  Political signage on vehicles as otherwise permitted by the sign regulations. 
(e)  Buses and mobile homes. No mobile homes, as defined in the state statutes, shall be parked within a residential district. In residential districts, buses shall be parked only in designated bus parking areas approved pursuant to the notification and procedures outlined for conditional uses. 
(f)  Boats, trailers, and recreational vehicles. 
(1)  Boats, trailers of any type, recreational vehicles, as defined in state statutes (including campers, travel trailers and motor homes) and similar vehicles shall not be parked or stored within any residential district including public rights-of-way, except as hereinafter specifically permitted. Under no circumstances shall any boat, trailer or recreational vehicle be slept in or otherwise used for lodging or habitation while parked or stored within a residential district. 
(2)  Boats and boat trailers may be parked if stored entirely within a carport, garage or enclosed structure. Recreational vehicles (including campers, travel trailers, and motor homes) and trailers (other than boat trailers) may be parked if stored entirely within a garage or other enclosed structure. As used herein, a garage or other enclosed structure shall mean a structure having at least 75 percent opaqueness. 
(3)  Boats, trailers and recreational vehicles having an overall length of 32 feet or less may be parked in a private driveway within a residential district for an aggregate of not more than 24 hours during any one calendar week. 
(4)  Boats, trailers and recreational vehicles may be parked or stored within side or rear lot areas of properties in residential districts provided no portion thereof shall be visible from the public right-of-way. 
(5)  The parking of boats, trailers and recreational vehicles in side and rear lot areas is permitted only if fences, walls and landscape screening, including hedges, trees, etc., of heights necessary to substantially screen the view of the boat, trailer or recreational vehicle shall be constructed and planted so as to buffer adjacent residential properties. 
(6)  Residents may allow their guests to park a boat, trailer or recreational vehicle having a length of 32 feet or less for up to seven days in the driveway or behind the main structure of the lot on which it is parked, provided that the building official shall be notified no later than 24 hours after such vehicle is so parked. After seven days have passed, at least 30 days shall elapse before the same vehicle shall be permitted to park on the same lot for another seven days. 
(g)  Projections into setbacks. Eaves, roof overhangs, open fire escapes, balconies, canopies, and awnings may project into the minimum yard or setback areas up to three and one-half feet. Chimneys and flues may project into the minimum yard or setback area up to three feet.

Second floor open porches, two-story high columns or similar features shall not project into the required front setback or street side setback. 
(h)  Corner lot and other residential setbacks. 
(1)  Front of lot. For corner lots, the side having the least street frontage shall be considered the front for setback purposes; however, the building director may waive this requirement and determine the front yard to be on the street front which is in line with the prevailing pattern of front yards on the street in order to be consistent with the established pattern of the street. For lots with front lot lines that are not generally perpendicular to the side lot lines and create a projection out on one side of the lot, the front setback shall be applied at the nonprojecting side of the lot and shall be extended across the lot perpendicular to the side lot line. 
(2)  Corner lot. In case of corner lots, the side yard setback toward the street shall be 15 feet on lots where the front of the lot has a width at the building line of 65 feet or less. On corner lots where the front of the lot has a width at the building line of more than 65 feet to 75 feet, a setback of 20 feet to the first floor and 22.5 feet to the second floor shall be provided on the street side yard. A setback of 25 feet shall be provided on corner lots over 75 feet in width, and the rear yard setback may be reduced by five feet on each floor. As an alternative, corner lots over 75 feet in width may utilize a side yard setback toward the street of 20 feet when the rear setbacks of 25 feet and 35 feet are provided to the first and second floors' walls. These special corner lot setbacks are applicable within the R-1AAA, R-1AA and R-1A districts and within single-family areas of planned unit residential districts (PURD). The street-side yard setback for lots over 65 feet in width for lots in the R-2 district shall be 20 feet. Accessory buildings (structures), swimming pools, spas and tennis courts shall also be set back according to these setbacks. The 22.5- and 25-foot side yard setbacks shall not apply to properties in the R-3, and R-4 districts. 
(3)  Through-lots. In case of through-lots, front yards shall be provided on all street frontages. Where one of the front yards that would normally be required on a through-lot is not in keeping with the prevailing yard pattern, the building director may waive the requirement which shall not exceed the average of the yards provided on adjacent lots. 
(4)  Lots of unusual shape. For any lots of unusual shape, not forming part of a general rectangular lot pattern, the building director shall prescribe front and side yard setbacks subject to the following limitations: 
a.  No front yard shall be required to have a greater depth than is required generally within the district. 
b.  No side yard shall be required to have a greater width than the depth required generally for front yards within the district. 
(5)  Garage and carport setbacks. All lots shall maintain a setback to a garage or carport door(s)/entry of at least 20 feet from any street front lot line so as to preclude the parking of vehicles over a sidewalk or in the right-of-way.

The setback to a lake, canal or stream shall not be construed as a side or rear setback. 
(2)  Pool decks shall be located no closer to the side and rear lot line than 50 percent of the required setback for swimming pools. Pool decks may be permitted in the remaining area of the required side and rear setbacks only if screened from the adjacent property by a six-foot masonry wall. The setback to a lake, canal or stream shall not be construed as a side or rear setback. Instead, on lakefront lots, pool decks must be set back a minimum of 50 feet from the ordinary high water elevations established in this article. On streamfront or canalfront lots, pool decks may be setback a minimum of 20 feet from the canal bulkhead if approved by the planning and zoning commission. 
(3)  Screen pool enclosures on lakefront, canalfront or streamfront lots shall be regulated as structures and located only within the required setbacks and as approved by the planning and zoning commission. Screen pool enclosures on nonwaterfront lots shall be regulated as structures and located only within required setbacks for the respective zoning district except as provided for in the following paragraphs: 
a.  The rear setback may be ten feet, subject to limiting the height of the screen enclosure to ten feet at the sides of the enclosure and 13 feet at the apex of the enclosure with increases in height allowed on a basis of one-to-one ratio from that point to the 25-foot setback. For example: a screen enclosure with a rear yard setback of 11 feet could be built with side walls no higher than 11 feet and the apex of the enclosure at the middle could be 14 feet in height. 
b.  The rear setback may be seven and one-half feet subject to limiting the height of the screen enclosure to seven and one-half feet in height at the rear setback and compliance to the height limitations cited above provided that there is also a dense landscape or solid fence buffer along the rear lot line to a minimum height of six feet installed and maintained. 
(4)  Other screen enclosures (not enclosing a swimming pool or spa) with screen roofs shall also be regulated as described above. 
(k)  Tennis courts. Tennis courts require side and rear setbacks of ten feet. Their associated backstop and side fencing shall also conform to these setbacks and shall not exceed 12 feet in height.

(m)  Residential driveways; parking spaces; motor courts, sidewalks, etc. Any residential sidewalk, driveway, parking space or other vehicle circulation area, whether of a paved surface such as asphalt, concrete or brick, or of an unpaved surface such as gravel, mulch or dirt, shall be setback at least two feet from the side or rear property lines, except where a common drive is permitted between adjoining properties or a nonconforming drive exists and does not create any drainage problem for an adjacent property. On lots that are 60 feet wide or less, a one-foot setback may be utilized as the driveway setback along a side lot line. The drive and parking surfaces must be designed to prohibit the diversion of drainage from vehicle driveways, parking or circulation areas onto adjacent properties. 
(n)  Walls and fences. 
(1)  Permits. Requests for permits for walls and fences must be accompanied by a site plan and drawings clearly showing the locations, heights and materials for which approval is requested. 
(2)  Height and setbacks in residential districts. In front yards and in side yards with street frontages, walls and fences shall not exceed three feet in height above the street curb elevation. However, these decorative front yard or street frontage walls and fences may be permitted columns or posts to exceed this height limit by one foot provided they are spaced at least ten feet apart. Light fixtures may also be placed on columns at driveway entrances up to one foot in height. In street-side yard areas of corner lots, a decorative fence or wall may be constructed five feet in height above the existing ground level when setback at least ten feet from the street-side property line. In all other side and rear yard areas, walls and fences may be a maximum of six feet in height above the ground. Where compliance with these height limits could cause a hardship due to the natural sloping topography of a particular lot, the administrative official may permit portions of a fence or wall to be up to eight feet in height in areas where the normal maximum height would be six feet; and where fences are normally limited to three feet in height above the street curb elevation, the administrative official may permit the fence to be measured from the natural ground level rather than the curb. No wall or fence shall be permitted which would in any way obstruct or impair the visibility of automobiles at intersections and points of ingress and egress to the public right-of-way. For walls and solid fences located on any street, a setback of one foot from the lot line is required to prevent interference with pedestrian mobility on existing or future sidewalks. Gates located on any street must match the openness of the fencing or no less than 60 percent open in composition whichever is greater. Walls and fences on the lakefront, canalfront, or streamfront side of properties shall meet the requirements established in this article for such waterfront properties. For purposes of locating walls and fences, front yards shall be the area from the front lot line to the front building wall or as determined by the building director. 
(3)  Materials permitted in residential districts. In any residential district, fences in the front yard or in a side yard with street frontage shall be decorative. Chain link, chicken wire or similar-type fences shall be prohibited. Barbed wire, electrically-charged fences and solid or mostly solid metal fences shall not be erected in any residential district. A wall, fence or similar structure erected in any residential district shall not contain material or substances such as broken glass, spikes, nails, barbs or similar materials designed to inflict pain or injury on any person or animal. 
(4)  Additional fence height for certain fencing in front and street-side yard areas. Fencing up to a maximum height of four feet shall only be permitted on a case-by-case basis by the town architect or building official for decorative open fencing such as wrought iron, aluminum, or similar types of fencing in front yards and in street-side yard areas with additional requirements such as landscaping and a setback from the lot line as determined for the specific property, and subject to not creating a traffic visibility hazard at points of ingress and egress to the public right-of-way. Wood, PVC (polyvinylchloride) and similar-type picket fences are limited to 3.5 feet in height. 
(5)  The column and post height of a wall or fence may exceed the allowable wall or fence height by a maximum of two feet in areas outside the front yard and street-side yards provided they are spaced 20 feet apart in side and rear yards, except the additional two feet of post height may be permitted on columns located on either side of entry gates in areas outside the front yard and street-side yards. 
(6)  Walls and fences shall be finished on both sides with similar architectural treatments and color on both surfaces so that, for example, a brick-veneered masonry wall shall have brick veneer on both sides or a stuccoed masonry wall shall have a stucco finish on both sides, a painted wood fence would be painted on both sides, unless different surface treatments and color are agreed upon by the property owners on both sides of the wall and the building director. 
(7)  Existing nonconforming walls or fences on corner lots located within a required setback may be repaired or replaced subject to verification that the new wall or fence does not create a traffic visibility obstruction, is not closer than five feet to a street-side property line and is constructed of a material permitted by this section. In addition, where a hedge or landscaping material was required as a screening buffer due to a variance or a condition of a permit, the hedge or landscaping material shall be maintained and irrigated to ensure continued viability. 
(8)  Corner lots with nonconforming walls or fences for one or two family dwellings: When an existing dwelling has a nonconforming building wall or fence located along a street side yard at a distance of ten feet or greater from the street side lot line, a new fence or wall complying with a permitted material up to six high is allowed to be constructed at the same nonconforming street side setback as a replacement in the same location. 
(o)  Building to have access on a public street. Every building hereafter erected or moved shall be on a lot with frontage on a public street or previously approved private street. The structures on these lots shall be so located so as to provide safe and convenient access for servicing, fire protection, other emergency vehicles, and required off-street parking. Furthermore, no building hereafter erected or moved shall be on a lot solely adjacent to an unpaved road.

Plans shall show the proposed date of commencement of work on the building in preparation for moving and the proposed date of completion of moving. 
(3)  Plans shall be reviewed by the city's administrative staff to determine that the proposed route, time of moving, and relocation of site are in conformity to the zoning, building and other applicable regulations of the city, and will not inconvenience the public or damage property. 
(4)  Plans shall also be submitted to all utility companies located in the city for their review and issuance of moving permits shall be conditioned upon approval of utility companies. Utility companies shall be entitled to make such requirements as they deem necessary to insure the utilities of the area will not be damaged or interrupted during the moving process. 
(5)  Prior to the issuance of a moving permit, the building shall be inspected by the building division of the city to insure that it is in conformity to the necessary building, plumbing, electrical, and other codes of the city or sufficient plans shall be provided showing compliance with all applicable building codes, and any deficiencies shall be corrected prior to the issuance of a moving permit or prior to final inspection approval of the building on the new site. 
(6)  Moving permits shall be issued only to companies or persons duly licensed as building movers in the city and who have posted the required $10,000.00 bond. The code enforcement director of the city shall have the authority to require such other and additional bonds as may be necessary to insure that the building is moved in a safe and proper manner and that property is protected. Any damage to city property or city trees shall be compensated by the building mover based on the cost of repairs for damage to city infrastructure, including, but not limited to, electrical equipment, water and sewer systems, streets, curbs, sidewalks, drainage conveyances, street lights and signs. Compensation for tree damage shall be in accordance with section 58-287. 
(7)  The building director shall have the power to accept or reject an application for a moving permit and may impose such additional regulations, conditions, or restrictions, as it deems necessary or proper to insure that the building is moved in a safe and proper manner, that property is protected during the moving process, that the moving process will not unreasonably inconvenience the public and that the building proposed to be moved will fit harmoniously into the neighborhood wherein it is to be located. Applicants may appeal these decisions to the city commission. Larger buildings over 2,500 square feet in gross area may be referred to the city commission for approval and any building moving applicant may appeal building moving determinations of the building director to the city commission. 
(s)  Curb cut permits. Any proposed construction in zoning districts other than R-1AAA, R-1AA, R-1A and R-2 shall have its access points or curb cuts for off-street parking facilities approved by the building director. In all such cases where that use has an access point or curb cut onto one public street, no additional curb cuts may be made onto another public street without the approval of the building director. Approval shall be based on a finding that no additional traffic will be directed onto local residential streets.

(1)  It is the intent of the city to improve the aesthetic appeal of the city and the reliability of utility service by requiring that utility lines, such as electric, telephone, cable TV, fiber optics and other utilities, be placed underground in conjunction with the construction of all new buildings. The implementation of underground utilities shall also be required as a component to the substantial renovation of any existing building. Substantial renovations shall be interpreted as when the building permit value of such renovations and/or additions exceeds 50 percent of the value of the existing improvements on the most current property tax roll. Property owners shall provide space on site within the private property or within the building for any necessary pad-mounted transformers and switch gear and shall screen such to the degree possible with landscaping or other approved screening when visible from the public right-of-way. 
(2)  The city recognizes that certain physical elements such as existing buildings, swimming pools, large trees and such may impose unreasonable hardships on property owner's compliance with the placement of utilities underground and for the location of transformers. Upon confirmation of these hardships by the utility companies, the building director may waive this requirement for such projects or may allow the waiver of up to two required parking spaces to be used for the required pad-mounted transformer and switch gear.

(e)  Minimum building site. There shall be no minimum building site size except that each site shall have a minimum frontage of 50 feet on a publicly dedicated right-of-way. 
(f)  Development standards. 
(1)  Any building constructed within this district shall adhere to the following minimum or required setbacks for front, rear and side yards. The front setback from all streets shall be a minimum of ten feet from the property line and a minimum of 15 feet on Orlando Avenue and on the north side of Fairbanks Avenue and 20 feet on the south side of Fairbanks Avenue. For properties along Orange Avenue, the front setback may be reduced to the average front setback of the existing buildings within that block if approved by the city commission. Side yard setbacks shall be a minimum of five feet from each property line unless the parcel shares a common line with a residentially-zoned parcel, then a 15-foot setback shall be observed. The rear setback shall be a minimum of 30 feet from the property line. However, within the Hannibal Square Neighborhood Commercial District area, as set forth in this section, new buildings shall have a required ten-foot front setback and may be permitted zero-foot side setbacks unless the parcel shares a common line with a residentially-zoned parcel, then a 15-foot side setback shall be observed. For any required front setback, the distance may be increased upon the determination by the public works director and police chief that a traffic sight distance safety problem may exist, to the extent required to remedy the problem. 
(2)  If a person constructing a building within this district desires to combine the minimum side yard setbacks and provide them on only one side of the lot, a site plan showing the locations of the proposed building as well as the location of existing adjacent buildings must be submitted to the planning and zoning commission for approval prior to the issuance of a building permit. This reduction to the required side setback, however, shall not be permitted if adjacent to a residentially-zoned parcel. 
(3)  The maximum floor area ratio and building lot coverage shall be 45 percent. The floor area ratio shall include the floor area of any attached or detached above-grade private parking garage. The 45 percent floor area ratio and building lot coverage may be increased by an additional five percent if the parking for the increased five percent floor area ratio is located entirely underground beneath the building's footprint or if the building's upper floor(s) are cantilevered over such parking. 
(4)  Exclusively residential buildings are not permitted. Residential units are not permitted on the first or ground floor. When residential units are included on the second floor or above, the floor area ratio of the project may be up to 60 percent FAR, but the maximum floor space that can be devoted to nonresidential (office) uses is 45 percent floor area ratio. Limited residential use of the first or ground floor of such buildings may be permitted when such space is limited to the functions of entrance lobby/elevator/stair access, leasing or management office, or residential amenity spaces, such as health/fitness, meeting/activity room or storage. However, in no case shall more than 15 percent of the first or ground floor be devoted to these ancillary residential uses (not counting the area of parking garages). 
(5)  The maximum floor area ratios outlined above are not an entitlement and are not achievable in all situations. Many factors may limit the achievable floor area ratio including limitations imposed by the maximum height map, concurrency management/level of service standards, physical limitations imposed by property dimensions and natural features as well as compliance with applicable code requirements such as, but not limited to, parking and internal circulation, setbacks, landscaping requirements, impervious lot coverage, design standards and on-site and off-site improvements and design amenities required to achieve land use compatibility. Land located across a street and/or separated from the building site shall not be included in the floor area ratio calculations. 
(6)  The maximum residential density shall not exceed 17 units per acre. 
(7)  Building heights shall not exceed the height limits imposed by the maximum height map. For those properties shown with a two-story maximum, the maximum building height shall be 30 feet; for those properties shown with a three-story maximum height, the maximum building height shall be 42.5 feet unless the property is located within the central business district, where the maximum height for three stories shall be 40 feet. Variances for more than three stories in the central business district are prohibited. For those properties shown with a four-story maximum height, the maximum building height shall be 55 feet; for those properties shown with a five-story maximum height, the maximum building height shall be 65 feet, and for the properties shown permitting up to eight stories, the maximum height shall be 95 feet. Unless specifically approved by the city commission as a conditional use, buildings developed with less than the maximum building stories shall conform to the height for the applicable stories. For example, if a two-story building is developed within an area permitting a four-story building, the two-story building shall conform to the 30-foot height limit. Parking garage levels shall be counted as stories for each level except for any basement level or the open roof level. 
(8)  Parapet walls, or mansard roofs functioning as parapet walls, may be added to the permitted building height but in no case shall extend more than five feet above the height limits in this subsection. Mechanical penthouses, mechanical and air-conditioning equipment, elevator/stair towers and related nonoccupied structures may be permitted to extend up to ten feet above the height limits in this subsection. Architectural appendages, embellishments and other architectural features may be permitted to exceed the roof heights specified in this section, on a limited basis, encompassing no more than 30 percent of the building roof length and area, up to eight feet of additional height, upon approval of the city commission, based on a finding that said features are compatible with adjacent projects. 
(9)  For properties not shown on the maximum height map located adjacent to four-lane roadways, the maximum height shall not exceed 55 feet, and the maximum height shall not exceed 42.5 feet for properties located adjacent to two-lane roadways. For corner properties adjacent to both four-lane and two-lane roadways, the maximum height shall be 55 feet. 
(10)  Terracing and articulation providing additional setbacks are required to create relief to the overall massing of the building facades. Such design features of building facade articulation are required at least every 60 feet, on average, along the primary building facades facing streets, or along the building frontage where the building fronts the primary parking lot area. For any building over two stories in height and over 200 feet in length, there shall be a 35-foot break on at least the first floor, the design of which shall be a component of the architectural review process required for conditional use. For any building over two stories or 30 feet in height, a significant portion comprising at least 75 percent of the top floor shall be terraced and stepped back from the exterior face of the next lower floor by at an average of at least five feet. Parking structures are exempt from this terracing requirement. 
(11)  Development shall not exceed 85 percent impervious coverage in this district. 
(12)  Whenever the rear or side property lines within this district share a common property line with parcels zoned residential, either a solid wall or fence (other than wood) shall be provided along the entire common line. The wall or fence shall be six feet in height; except that such wall or fence shall be only three feet in height from the front setback line of the adjoining parcel to the front property line of the adjoining parcel. 
(13)  Other code sections related to development that should be referenced include, but are not limited to, off-street parking regulations, maximum height map, general provisions, definitions, sign regulations, (article IV), environmental protection, (article V) (this section includes division 1, stormwater; division 6, tree preservation; division 8, landscape regulations; division 9, irrigation regulations; and division 10, exterior lighting), subdivision regulations (article VI), historic preservation (article VIII) and concurrency management regulations (article II).

Sec. 58-74. - Commercial (C-1) district. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. 
(1)  Shopping centers have unique development requirements which are dissimilar from other commercial areas; therefore, this section establishes a separate commercial zoning district intended to be used in connection with the city's shopping centers. 
(2)  This district establishes restrictions to insure that shopping centers are designed and located to minimize traffic congestion on public highways and streets in their vicinity and to best fit the general land use pattern of the area to be served by the center. The protective standards contained in this district are intended to minimize any adverse effect of the center on nearby property values and to provide for safe, efficient use of the center itself and safe, adequate and attractive parking areas. 
(3)  Shopping centers are intended to provide areas for a combination of uses, including retail businesses, personal services, banking and professional services and office facilities to serve either a small neighborhood or the entire community. 
(4)  It is the intention of this district to locate shopping centers only at locations that the city commission determines are suitable. Shopping centers are not permitted in the central business district or within the Hannibal Square Neighborhood Commercial District. The city commission may call upon the applicant to furnish additional information establishing compatibility with adjacent uses to justify the rezoning or use of land for a shopping center. 
(b)  Permitted uses. All business uses and activities shall be conducted exclusively and wholly within an enclosed building except those uses permitted which are customarily conducted in the open such as off-street parking, plant and landscape garden sales and outdoor patio dining.

(6)  Private and semi-private clubs, lodges, halls and/or social centers; 
(7)  Uses customarily incidental and accessory to the permitted uses, including the repair of goods of the type sold in stores in the center, provided that such repair may not be carried on as a separate business, and provided, further, that there shall be no manufacturing, assembling, compounding, processing or treatment of products, other than that which is clearly incidental and essential to the permitted uses. 
(8)  Churches, nonprofit organizations' halls/lodges and schools (see parking requirements for limitations). 
(c)  Conditional uses. The following uses may be permitted as conditional uses following review by the planning and zoning commission and approval by the city commission in accordance with the provisions of this article. See section 58-90, conditional uses. 
(1)  Drive-in components of any business; 
(2)  Buildings over 10,000 square feet or any addition over 250 square feet to an existing building over 10,000 square feet or additions to existing buildings that result in a building over 10,000 square feet in size; 
(3)  Any conditional use provided in the R-3 or R-4 districts utilizing and limited to the site and improvement regulations of this district for those conditional uses; 
(4)  Fitness facility, exercise or health club; 
(5)  Any building with residential units as a component of the building. However, time shares are not permitted. 
(6)  Car rental agencies limited to a maximum of 15 cars on site at any time, although the city may set a lower maximum number. 
(d)  Minimum site for shopping center. The minimum parcel to be zoned for this district shall be two acres. Such parcel must be located in part on a street or highway considered to be major arterial street and capable of carrying the high volume of traffic a shopping center will generate. 
(e)  Development standards. 
(1)  Any building constructed within this district shall adhere to the following minimum required setbacks for front, rear and side yards. The front setback from all streets shall be a minimum of 15 feet from the property line. Side and rear yard setbacks from interior property lines within or adjacent to any other C-1 district parcel shall be a minimum of five feet from each property line but shall be 20 feet to any other non-C-1 zoned parcel and 35 feet to any residentially-zoned parcel. For any required front setback, the distance may be increased upon the determination by the city that a traffic sight distance safety problem may exist to the extent required to remedy the problem. 
(2)  If a person constructing a building within this district desires to combine the minimum side yard setbacks and provide them on only one side of the lot, a site plan showing the locations of the proposed building as well as the location of existing adjacent building must be submitted to the planning and zoning commission for approval prior to the issuance to a building permit to ensure sufficient compatibility with adjacent properties. This reduction to the required side setback, however, shall not be permitted if adjacent to a residentially-zoned parcel. 
(3)  The maximum floor area ratio and building lot coverage shall be 45 percent. The floor area ratio shall include the floor area of any attached or detached above-grade private parking garage. The 45 percent floor area ratio and building lot coverage may be increased by an additional five percent if the parking for the increased five-percent floor area ratio is located entirely underground beneath the building's footprint or if the building's upper floor(s) are cantilevered over such parking or if it is for a hotel building. 
(4)  Exclusively residential buildings are not permitted. Residential units are not permitted on the first or ground floor. When residential units are included on the second floor or above, the floor area ratio may be up to 60 percent FAR, but the maximum floor space that can be devoted to nonresidential (office) uses is 45 percent floor area ratio. Limited residential use of the first or ground floor of such buildings may be permitted when limited to the functions of entrance lobby/elevator/stair access, leasing or management office or residential amenity spaces such as health/fitness, meeting/activity room or storage. However, in no case shall more than 15 percent of the first or ground floor be devoted to these ancillary residential uses (not counting the area of parking garages). 
(5)  The maximum floor area ratios outlined above are not an entitlement and are not achievable in all situations. Many factors may limit the achievable floor area ratio including limitations imposed by the maximum height map, concurrency management/level of service standards, physical limitations imposed by property dimensions and natural features, as well as compliance with applicable code requirements such as, but not limited to, parking and internal circulation, setbacks, landscaping requirements, impervious lot coverage, design standards and on-site and off-site improvements and design amenities required to achieve land use compatibility. Land located across a street and/or separated from the building site shall not be included in the floor area ratio calculations. 
(6)  The maximum residential density shall not exceed 17 units per acre. 
(7)  Development shall not exceed 85 percent impervious coverage in this district. 
(8)  Building heights shall not exceed the height limits imposed by the maximum height map for those properties within the geographic areas shown with a two-story maximum, the maximum building height shall be 30 feet; for those properties shown with a three-story maximum height, the maximum building height shall be 42.5 feet; for those properties shown with a four-story maximum height, the maximum building height shall be 55 feet; for those properties shown with a five-story maximum height, the maximum building height shall be 65 feet; and for the properties shown permitting up to eight stories, the maximum height shall be 95 feet. Unless specifically approved by the city commission as a conditional use, properties with buildings developed with less than the maximum building stories shall conform to the maximum height for the applicable stories. For example, if a two-story building is developed within an area permitting a four-story building, the two-story building shall conform to the 30-foot height limit. Parking garage levels shall be counted as stories for each level except for any basement level or the open roof level. 
(9)  Parapet walls, or mansard roofs functioning as parapet walls, may be added to the permitted building height but in no case shall extend more than five feet above the height limits in this subsection. Mechanical penthouses, mechanical and air-conditioning equipment, elevator/stair towers and related nonoccupied structures may be permitted to extend up to ten feet above the height limits in this subsection. Architectural appendages, embellishments and other architectural features may be permitted to exceed the roof heights specified in this section, on a limited basis; encompassing no more than 30 percent of the building roof length, up to eight feet of additional height upon approval of the city commission, based on a finding that said features are compatible with adjacent properties. 
(10)  For properties not shown on the maximum height map, located adjacent to four-lane roads, the maximum height shall not exceed 55 feet, and the maximum height shall not exceed 42.5 feet for properties located adjacent to two-lane roadways. For corner properties adjacent to both four-lane and two-lane roadways, the maximum height shall be 55 feet. 
(11)  Terracing and articulation providing additional setbacks are required to create relief to the overall massing of the building facades. Such design features of building facade articulation are required at least every 60 feet, on average, along the primary building facades facing streets or the building frontage where the building fronts its primary parking lot area. For any building over two stories in height and over 200 feet in length, there shall be a 35-foot break on at least the first floor, the design of which shall be a component of the architectural review process required for conditional use. For any building over two stories in height, a significant portion of the top floor shall be terraced and stepped back from the exterior face of the next lower floor by an average of at least five feet. Parking structures are exempt from this terracing requirement. 
(12)  Whenever the rear or side property lines within this district share a common property line with parcels zoned residential, either a solid wall or fence (other than wood), shall be provided along the entire common line. The wall or fence shall be six feet in height; except that such wall or fence shall be only three feet in height from the front setback line of the adjoining parcel to the front property line of the adjoining parcel. 
(13)  The maximum impervious coverage shall be 85 percent of any property. 
(14)  Any above-grade parking garages or decks constructed within this district must be at least 100 feet away from any property used for single-family or low-density residential. 
(15)  Other code sections related to development that should be referenced include, but are not limited to, off-street parking regulations, maximum height map, general provisions, definitions, sign regulations (article IV), environmental protection (article V) (this section includes division 1, stormwater; division 6, tree preservation; division 8, landscape regulations; division 9, irrigation regulations; and division 10 exterior lighting), subdivision regulations (article VI), historic preservation (article VIII) and concurrency management regulations (article II). 
(f)  Shopping center parking requirements. It is the intent of the city to require shopping centers to provide adequate parking for the businesses within a shopping center but at the same time avoid the proliferation or overbuilding of parking for shopping centers which is prevalent throughout most of the nation. The parking requirements of this zoning code, as with most other cities, is based on providing adequate parking for customers at a single destination. In shopping centers where customers often have multiple destinations, this often leads to an overbuilding of parking. As a result, this district establishes both minimum and maximum parking requirements as follows: 
(1)  Shopping centers shall meet and provide the minimum number of parking spaces required by this Code, as a cumulative total of the individual businesses or tenant spaces, except as otherwise provided for by this section. 
(2)  In calculating the minimum parking standards, internal pedestrian mall areas, corridors that are in the shopping center common areas (as opposed to individual tenant spaces), and areas dedicated to mechanical, electrical or plumbing space that services shopping centers generally (as opposed to individual tenant spaces) within the shopping centers may be excluded from the area calculated in meeting the parking requirements. However, parking shall be provided for all tenant areas within these mall areas, including freestanding retail booths, restaurant areas, food court areas, ticket sales, and other vending areas. Shopping centers shall not be required to provide parking for pedestrian mall areas that are utilized for special events such as antique car show, used book sales, art shows, antique shows, craft shows, etc. 
(3)  In calculating the minimum parking standards, this Code shall allow for warehouse or storage areas within the major anchor stores and individual tenant spaces to be counted as a warehouse and storage use, provided these spaces are restricted to these uses and do not exceed ten percent of the gross leasable area. 
(4)  A percentage of the parking required by this Code may be composed of grass or other pervious surfaces when that parking is deemed to be located where it will be utilized on an infrequent basis except for certain peak holiday shopping periods. 
(5)  To the extent various businesses have different times of usage during the day, the city commission may consider this mix of uses in establishing compliance with the minimum parking requirements of this section as part of the review and approval of building permit plans as specified in this district. 
(g)  Minimum off-site accommodations for traffic. Given that shopping centers are major traffic generators, these shopping centers, at the time of development, expansion or major redevelopment, shall be required to address the off-site traffic generation and transportation impacts of the development proposed and adherence to the city's concurrency management regulations. The city shall require submission of transportation impact studies by independent transportation consulting firms to determine the scale and nature of the impacts and compensating or mitigating actions deemed appropriate. The city may require site-related off-site traffic and transportation improvements as deemed necessary. Adherence to the city's concurrency management regulations may require financial contribution to the provision of transportation and transit service, including, but not limited to, the cost of transit vehicles and operations and maintenance cost. 
(h)  Minimum on-site accommodations for transit. 
(1)  Given that shopping centers are the focal point for many transit users, these shopping centers, at the time of development, expansion or major redevelopment, shall be required to address on-site provisions for transit services or located off-site adjacent to the shopping center acceptable to the city that will accommodate and encourage the use of mass transit. The city shall require that appropriate provisions be made to accommodate these transit needs including, but not limited to, transit vehicle parking and transfer areas, transit benches and shelters, transit signage, etc.; provided, however, the transit facilities shall be appropriately located at site plan review so as not to interfere with pedestrian or automobile access to the shopping center. 
(2)  Shopping centers shall also be required to accommodate alternate modes of transportation, such as bicycles, by providing accommodations including bicycle racks and/or storage shelters. 
(i)  Urban design guidelines and standards. The city commission may adopt and impose urban design and architectural guidelines and standards upon the development or redevelopment of shopping centers as necessary to accomplish the goals and objectives of this article. 
(j)  Morse Boulevard design guidelines. 
(1)  The Morse Boulevard designated area is defined as those properties fronting Morse Boulevard between New York Avenue and Denning Drive and additionally the properties in the blocks bounded by Morse Boulevard, Denning Drive, Canton Avenue and Harper Street. 
(2)  In addition to the other requirements and regulations of the C-1 zoning district and prior to the issuance of a building permit for the construction, renovation or remodeling of any building or building exterior facade fronting on a street within the Morse Boulevard designated area, an applicant is required to obtain approval of the plans by the planning department. 
(3)  Building elevation drawings and other plans shall be submitted with sufficient detail to indicate the building materials, composition, color, etc., so that the visual appearance of the resultant work is readily apparent. 
(4)  For purposes of this subsection, replacements, renovations or changes to canopies or awnings and to signage on walls, canopies or awnings shall be considered remodeling of the building facade. 
(5)  The planning department shall render a decision on all applications for building permits for building facade construction, renovation or remodeling. The decision of the planning department shall be made within ten working days, excluding holidays, of the receipt of a complete set of plans and application materials, unless referred to the planning and zoning commission for review as outlined below. 
(6)  The planning department's decision shall be either an approval, an approval with conditions or denial. Any applicant for building facade approval may elect to appeal a decision of the planning department to the planning and zoning commission for their consideration. 
(7)  Decisions by the planning department and/or the planning and zoning commission shall be made based on the conformance of plans and application materials to the Morse Boulevard design guidelines and criteria adopted by the city commission. 
(8)  The decision of the planning and zoning commission shall be the final decision of the city except where a building project also requires conditional use or other land development approval by the city commission. In that case, the decision of the planning and zoning commission shall be a recommendation with the final decision made by the city commission.

Sec. 58-75. - Commercial (C-2) district. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. 
(1)  This commercial zoning district is limited to the commercial portion of the geographic downtown area known as the central business district and the similar commercial area of the city within the Hannibal Square Neighborhood Commercial District (HSNCD) of the city's community redevelopment area (CRA). As detailed in the comprehensive plan, commercial (C-2) district zoning is not permitted on any property except if it is within the central business district "potential C-2 zoning" area depicted in the CBD Map (D-2) in the definitions section, generally described as west of Knowles Avenue, south of Swoope Avenue, north of Comstock Avenue and east of and including the New York Avenue Corridor, or it is on properties abutting Morse Blvd between Capen and Virginia Avenues, abutting New England Avenue between Pennsylvania and New York Avenues, abutting Pennsylvania Avenue between Garfield and Lyman Avenues, or abutting Hannibal Square, East. No applications for C-2 zoning shall be accepted for any property outside these designated areas. Moreover, even properties within these designated areas shall have no vested right to C-2 zoning. This district has different requirements than other commercial areas, especially pertaining to setbacks, parking requirements, height limitations and permitted land uses, including a prohibition on drive-in businesses. This district is established to encourage the continuation of the present unique Park Avenue business district of the city and to provide for its use within certain other defined geographical areas as specified in the comprehensive plan. 
(2)  The regulations outlined in this district encourage the continuation of the present aesthetically pleasing central business district, provide areas for the concentration of compatible land uses, and provide for appropriate commercial, restaurant and residential uses which will strengthen the city's economic base. 
(3)  For purposes of this section, the Park Avenue Corridor is that area which encompasses those properties having frontage on Park Avenue or 
(b)  Permitted uses. All permitted uses shall be conducted so as to emphasize the pedestrian orientation of the district. Thus, drive-in-type businesses or uses which have a drive-in component as part of their operation shall not be permitted. All uses permitted shall be conducted exclusively within a building except those uses permitted which are customarily conducted in the open such as off-street parking and outdoor patio seating for dining. Storage shall be limited to accessory storage of commodities sold at retail on the premises and storage shall be within a completely enclosed building. Bars, taverns, cocktail lounges, and fast food restaurants are prohibited in this zoning district. In addition, no single tenant building larger than 65,000 square feet is permitted regardless if portions of such single tenant business, such as a grocery store, may have a sublease for an interior coffee shop, bank, etc. 
(1)  Retail businesses involved in the sale of merchandise on the premises within enclosed buildings but excluding resale establishments or pawn shops (other than clothing resale stores) and excluding vapor lounges, smoke shops, cigar stores and liquor stores. 
(2)  Personal services limited to hotels, and shoe/watch repair businesses but excluding places of amusement such as game rooms, video or internet arcades, tattoo, body art or fortune-telling businesses and the like. 
(3)  Banks, savings and loans, financial institutions, travel agencies, photographic studios, interior design studios, barber shops, beauty/nail salons, spas, state-licensed massage therapists, cosmetic and skin care treatment businesses, governmental, educational, medical, real estate and other offices but only when such uses are located above the ground floor within the Park Avenue Corridor or located on any floor outside the Park Avenue Corridor. This shall be referred to as the Park Avenue corridor vertical zoning restrictions. 
(4)  Residences located on any floor outside of the Park Avenue Corridor but only above the ground floor within the Park Avenue Corridor and on properties with frontage on New England Avenue between Pennsylvania and Park Avenues. 
(5)  Public and semi-private facilities such as museums, lodges, libraries and the like. 
(6)  Fine dining restaurants, as well as ice cream, tea, coffee, cheese, pastry and bakery stores with retail sales and consumption of food and beverage products on premises, except that only those restaurants satisfying the criteria set forth below shall be permitted uses in the Park Avenue Corridor. 
a.  Fine dining restaurants. To qualify for a permitted use, a fine dining restaurant must provide, and continually adhere to, a detailed written description of the business operations and plan layout of dining and food service areas to show the restaurant satisfies the criteria of section 58-95, fine dining restaurant. 
b.  Non-fine dining restaurants. Certain other restaurants (other than fast food restaurants, which are a prohibited use) shall qualify for a permitted use in the Park Avenue Corridor, provided that they satisfy the following criteria and do not exceed the percentages set forth in this section: 
1.  Upon a patron's request, on-site food and beverage service shall be provided via table service by servers; 
2.  Appropriate visible signage is provided to notify patrons of the availability of table service; 
3.  The menu consists of a variety of food options including pre-entree items (soups, salads, appetizers, etc.) entrees, sides and desserts; 
4.  Non-disposable dinnerware (utensils, plates, etc.) shall be provided; 
5.  Food items are predominately freshly prepared on site rather than just the warming, microwaving or final preparation of pre-packaged items; and 
6.  All tables are bussed by restaurant staff. 
The number of non-fine dining restaurants shall not exceed 20 percent of the available first floor storefronts of either side of any city block in the Park Avenue Corridor, nor 15 percent of the total number of businesses in the Park Avenue Corridor. If a restaurant currently operating within the Park Avenue Corridor as of the enactment of this ordinance [from which this section derived] ceases business operations, any applicant proposing a restaurant use in that location must satisfy the criteria for a permitted use restaurant (fine dining; non-fine dining, meeting the criteria of subsections 58-75(b)(6)b.1-6.; or coffee shop, bakery and dessert restaurant). Provided that the restaurant use has not been discontinued for a period greater than three months, as provided in subsection 58-64(d)(6) of this Code, a non-fine dining restaurant will be permitted in the location of an existing restaurant, regardless of the percentage limitations on non-fine-dining restaurants. 
c.  Coffee shops, bakery and dessert restaurants. Certain restaurants that do not provide full service of food and beverages, but limit their offerings to particular food and beverages reflecting the core business of the restaurant and a limited number of ancillary non-core items, are permitted uses. These restaurants include, but are not limited to, ice cream, frozen yogurt, Italian ice, smoothie, cookie, tea, coffee, wine, cheese, pastry and bakery stores. The restaurants of this category must also provide retail sales and consumption of the named core food or beverage products on premises. Such restaurants shall include, as part of their application for the business tax receipt, a menu identifying the core offerings of the business and a limited number of ancillary non-core items. The restaurants of this category shall not change their core offerings, nor significantly expand their ancillary, non-core offerings, without submitting an application to the City for another business tax receipt. 
(7)  Churches, nonprofit organizations' halls/lodges and schools less than 5,000 square feet in size. (See parking requirements for limitations). 
(c)  Conditional uses. The following uses may be permitted as conditional uses following review by the planning and zoning board and approval by the city commission in accordance with the provisions of this C-2 district section only. See section 58-90, conditional uses. 
(1)  Restaurants, outside of the Park Avenue Corridor, with the exception of fine dining restaurants, ice cream, tea, coffee, cheese, pastry and bakery shops, with retail sales and consumption on premises; 
(2)  Churches, nonprofit organizations' halls/lodges, and schools 5,000 square feet or larger in size. (See parking requirements for limitations). 
(3)  Buildings with a third floor and up to 40 feet in height provided that such conditional use approvals require two public hearing approvals by the city commission; 
(4)  Retail stores in excess of 6,000 square feet per floor; 
(5)  Reserved. 
(6)  Buildings over 10,000 square feet or any addition over 500 square feet to an existing building over 10,000 square feet or additions over 500 square feet to existing buildings that result in a building over 10,000 square feet in size. 
(d)  Minimum building lot size. There shall be no minimum lot size in this district. 
(e)  Development standards. 
(1)  On all streets, buildings and structures shall be built to a zero-foot building setback from the property line or such front setback as is established by the average front setback of the existing buildings on that block of street frontage, whichever is greater. However, canopies may extend over the sidewalks provided a clearance of nine feet, zero inches is maintained from the sidewalk to the bottom portion of the canopy. 
(2)  Building heights shall not exceed the height limits imposed by the maximum height map. For those properties within the geographic areas shown with a two-story maximum, the maximum building height shall be 30 feet; for those properties shown with a three-story maximum height, the maximum building height may be up to 40 feet if approved via conditional use. Variances for more than three stories in the central business district are prohibited. Parapet walls, mansard, gable or hip roof appendages or similar architectural elements or appendages on a one- or two-story building may be added to the building height but in no case shall extend more than five feet above the building roof height limitations established in the section. Mechanical equipment, elevator towers and related nonoccupied structures may be added to the building roof height but in no case shall exceed more than ten feet above these building roof height limitations and shall be located to the maximum extent possible so that they are not visible from the street. 
(3)  Buildings shall be setback no less than ten feet from the rear lot line. 
(4)  No side yard setbacks shall be required on interior side property lines. 
(5)  The maximum floor area ratio for any building shall be 200 percent. The floor area ratio shall include the floor area of any attached or detached above-grade private parking garage. 
(6)  The maximum floor area ratios outlined above are not an entitlement and are not achievable in all situations. Many factors may limit the achievable floor area ratio, including limitations imposed by the maximum height map, concurrency management/level of service standards, physical limitations imposed by property dimensions and natural features as well as compliance with applicable code requirements such as, but not limited to, parking and internal circulation, setbacks, landscaping requirements, impervious lot coverage, design standards and on-site and off-site improvements and design amenities required to achieve land use compatibility. Land located across a street and/or separated from the building site shall not be included in the floor area ratio calculations. 
(7)  The maximum residential density shall not exceed 17 units per acre. 
(8)  Terracing and articulation requiring additional setbacks are required to create relief to the overall massing of the building facades. Such design features of building facade articulation are required at least every 60 feet, on average, along the primary building facades facing the streets, or along the building frontage where the building fronts the primary parking lot area. For any building over two stories in height and over 200 feet in length, there shall be a 35-foot break on at least the first floor, the design of which shall be a component of the architectural review process required for conditional use. For any building over two stories or 30 feet in height, a significant portion of the top floor shall be terraced and stepped back from the exterior face of the next lower floor. Parking structures are exempt from this terracing requirement. 
(9)  Any above-grade parking garages or decks constructed within this district must be at least 100 feet away from any property used for single-family or low-density residential. 
(10)  Other code sections related to development that should be referenced include, but are not limited to, off-street parking regulations, maximum height map, general provisions, definitions, sign regulations (article IV), environmental protection (article V) (this section includes division 1, stormwater; division 6, tree preservation; division 8, landscape regulations; division 9, irrigation regulations; and division 10 exterior lighting), subdivision regulations (article VI), historic preservation (article VIII) and concurrency management regulations (article II). 
(11)  All properties facing on Park Avenue or adjacent roads within 140 feet of Park Avenue or that are located across from Central Park and all properties that abut Central Park, where development would impact the open vista of Central Park shall be limited to two stories in height as depicted on the maximum height map. Variances or approvals of development in violation of this policy are prohibited. 
(f)  Nonconforming uses. 
(1)  Notwithstanding the provisions for nonconforming uses elsewhere in this article, those properties which are nonconforming uses with respect to the Park Avenue Corridor vertical zoning restrictions shall be permitted to change occupancy or tenancy to a similar nonconforming use provided the existing use on the premises is not discontinued for a period of three months or more. 
(2)  Notwithstanding the provisions for these nonconforming uses elsewhere in this article, those properties which are nonconforming uses with respect to the Park Avenue Corridor, vertical zoning restrictions, shall be allowed to relocate and exchange locations with an existing permitted use provided the square footage and frontage remains the same or less and provided the original nonconforming use space is converted and committed to use as a permitted use and provided such a relocation and exchange is approved by the city commission. 
(g)  Park Avenue Corridor Vertical zoning restrictions special circumstances. In certain instances, there may exist buildings or tenant spaces that are within the Park Avenue Corridor vertical zoning restrictions which present special circumstances which mitigate against prohibiting ground-floor businesses, such as offices, beauty/barber salon, spas, cosmetic treatments businesses. These building areas may receive a special exception from the Park Avenue Corridor vertical zoning restrictions. In addition to the criteria previously detailed in that section, the following additional factors must be satisfied. The use must occupy floor space which fronts on a side or rear street other than Park Avenue or consist of an interior space fronting on an adjoining pedestrian arcade which does not front on Park Avenue. The area must either be an independent structure or not exceed 25 percent of the ground-floor area of all existing tenant space within the building involved. The area must not be visible from Park Avenue or should be remote from visibility if located on a side street. The area must not inhibit the predominately retail character of the immediately surrounding area of the central business district. 
(h)  Restaurants. The following standards and criteria shall apply: 
(1)  The city has established that outside of the Park Avenue Corridor all existing and proposed restaurants are conditional uses in this zoning district, except fine dining restaurants, and ice cream, tea, coffee, cheese, pastry and bakery stores, with retail sales and consumption on premises. For those restaurants that are conditional uses, renovations, changes in decor, floor plan, menu or operating hours up to midnight are not deemed to be significant changes which require amendment of the conditional use permit. Changes which result in the addition of building area, seating or operating hours beyond midnight are deemed to be significant changes which require amendment/approval of a conditional use. 
(2)  In order for these restaurant C-2 zoning regulations to be effectively applied, this article contains strict definitions of fine dining restaurants, non-fine dining restaurants, and coffee shops, bakery and dessert restaurants, which are either permitted uses or require conditional use approval, and cocktail lounges, taverns, and bars, as well as fast food restaurants, which are prohibited uses. Generally, if there is consumption of either food or alcoholic beverages on the premises, then the conditional use requirement applies with the exceptions of the permitted uses shown in subsection (b)(6) above. If the business is solely for food or alcoholic beverage sale for consumption off the premises, then conditional use approval is not required. With food stores or convenience stores where the primary business is the retail sale of food and beverages for consumption off premises, or when prepared sandwiches or other food is clearly incidental to the principal retail activity, then limited consumption on premises (up to ten seats) inside the premises is permitted without conditional use approval. Otherwise, if a restaurant does not fit under one of the permitted uses in subsection (b)(6) above, then conditional use approval is required. 
(3)  Among the issues reviewed for conditional uses in this district, the adequacy of parking is often the most contentious. A frequent proposition is that the type of business, its menu, its hours or its size will cater exclusively to pedestrian traffic from employees and visitors already in the downtown. In light of the ability for the nature of the business to change, this proposition is not agreed to be an acceptable argument for the inadequacy of private parking. 
(4)  The hours and types of amplified musical entertainment permitted within any type of restaurant shall be governed by the noise regulations within chapter 10 of the Code of Ordinances. 
(i)  Standards and criteria for conditional uses. 
(1)  General. These standards are in addition to the standards set forth in section 58-90. Each application for a conditional use shall be accompanied by a site plan, drawn to scale, showing the location and area of the building with respect to the adjacent building including all driveways, sidewalks and off-street parking spaces. The site plan submittal shall also include floor plan(s) depicting the area intended to be devoted to customer use, employee use, and storage needs. Upon approval of any application, said site and floor plan and accompanying data plus any conditions imposed by the city commission shall become part of the conditional use permit. It may be amended only by the city commission after receipt of a recommendation from the planning and zoning commission. A conditional use permit may be issued after a hearing based on the following criteria: 
a.  The proposed use is in keeping with the character of the central business district or CRA area as a distinctive retail and restaurant district of individual specialty stores and fine dining restaurants; 
b.  The proposed use will not negatively affect the aesthetic character of the area nor create or significantly increase vehicle and pedestrian conflicts; 
c.  The proposed use will not cause traffic congestion due to vehicles obstructing the public streets while waiting to use any facility, or in any manner obstruct traffic; 
d.  The proposed use provides a degree of private off-street parking that is in keeping with its peak and normal demand for parking.

(d)  Minimum building site. There shall be no minimum lot size area however the lot must have a minimum frontage of 50 feet on a major arterial street. 
(e)  Development standards. 
(1)  Any building constructed within this district shall adhere to the following minimum or required setbacks for front, rear and side yards. The front setback to all streets shall be a minimum of ten feet from the property line and a minimum of 15 feet on Orlando Avenue. For properties along Orange Avenue, the front setback may be reduced to the average front setback of the existing buildings within that block if approved by the city commission. Side yard setbacks shall be a minimum of five feet from each property line, unless the parcel shares a common line with a residentially-zoned parcel, then a 15-foot setback shall be observed. The rear setback shall be a minimum of 30 feet from the property line unless the rear yard abuts a residentially zoned parcel, then a 35-foot setback shall be observed. However, within the Hannibal Square Neighborhood Commercial District area, as set forth in this section, new buildings shall have a required ten-foot front setback and may be permitted zero-foot side setbacks, unless the parcel shares a common line with a residentially-zoned parcel, then a 15-foot setback shall be observed. For any required front setback, the distance may be increased upon the determination by the public works director and police chief that a traffic sight distance safety problem may exist, to the extent required to remedy the problem. 
(2)  If a person constructing a building within this district desires to combine the minimum side yard setbacks and provide them on only one side of the lot, a site plan showing the locations of the proposed building as well as the location of existing adjacent building must be submitted to the planning and zoning commission for approval prior to the issuance to a building permit to ensure sufficient compatibility with adjacent properties. This reduction to the required side setback, however, shall not be permitted if adjacent to a residentially-zoned parcel. 
(3)  The maximum floor area ratio and building lot coverage shall be 45 percent. The floor area ratio shall include the floor area of any attached or detached above-grade private parking garage. The 45 percent floor area ratio and building lot coverage may be increased by an additional five percent if the parking for the increased five percent floor area ratio is located entirely underground beneath the building's footprint or if the building's upper floor(s) are cantilevered over such parking or if it is for a hotel building. 
(4)  Exclusively residential buildings are not permitted. Residential units are not permitted on the first or ground floor. When residential units are included on the second floor or above, the floor area ratio of the project may be up to 60 percent FAR. Limited residential use of the first or ground floor of such buildings may be permitted when such space is limited to the functions of entrance lobby/elevator/stair access, leasing or management office or residential amenity spaces such as health/fitness, meeting/activity room or storage. However, in no case shall more than 15 percent of first or ground floor be devoted to these ancillary residential uses (not counting the area of parking garages). 
(5)  The maximum floor area ratios outlined above are not an entitlement and are not achievable in all situations. Many factors may limit the achievable floor area ratio including limitations imposed by the maximum height map, concurrency management/level of service standards, physical limitations imposed by property dimensions and natural features as well as compliance with applicable code requirements such as, but not limited to, parking and internal circulation, setbacks, landscaping requirements, impervious lot coverage, design standards and on-site and off-site improvements and design amenities required to achieve land use compatibility. Land located across a street and/or separated from the building site shall not be included in the floor area ratio calculations. 
(6)  The maximum residential density shall not exceed 17 units per acre. 
(7)  Building heights shall not exceed the height limits imposed by the maximum height map. For those properties shown with a two-story maximum, the maximum building height shall be 30 feet; for those properties shown with a three-story maximum height, the maximum building height shall be 42.5 feet, unless located within the central business district where the maximum height for three stories shall be 40 feet if approved as a conditional use. Variances for more than three stories in the central business district are prohibited. For those properties shown with a four-story maximum height, the maximum building height shall be 55 feet; for those properties shown with a five-story maximum height, the maximum building height shall be 65 feet and for the properties shown permitting up to eight stories, the maximum height shall be 95 feet. Unless specifically approved by the city commission as a conditional use, buildings developed with less than the maximum building stories shall conform to the maximum height for the applicable stories. For example, if a two-story building is developed within an area permitting a four-story building, the two-story building shall conform to the 30-foot height limit. Parking garage levels shall be counted as stories for each level except for any basement level or the open roof level. 
(8)  Parapet walls, or mansard roofs functioning as parapet walls, may be added to the permitted building height but in no case shall extend more than five feet above the height limits in this subsection. Mechanical penthouses, mechanical and air-conditioning equipment, elevator/stair towers and related nonoccupied structures may be permitted to extend up to ten feet above the height limits in this subsection. Architectural appendages, embellishments and other architectural features may be permitted to exceed the roof heights specified in this section, on a limited basis, encompassing no more than 30 feet of the building roof length and area, up to eight feet of additional height, upon approval of the city commission, based on a finding that said features are compatible with adjacent projects. 
(9)  For properties not shown on the maximum height map, located adjacent to four-lane roadways, the maximum height shall not exceed 55 feet, and the maximum height shall not exceed 42.5 feet for properties located adjacent to two-lane roadways. For corner properties adjacent to both four-lane and two-lane roadways, the maximum height shall be 55 feet. 
(10)  Terracing and articulation providing additional setbacks are required to create relief to the overall massing of the building facades. Such design features of building facade articulation are required at least every 60 feet, on average, along the primary building facades facing streets, or the building frontage where the building fronts primary parking lot area. For any building over two stories in height and over 200 feet in length, there shall be a 35-foot break on at least the first floor, the design of which shall be a component of the architectural review process required for conditional use. For any building over two stories or 30 feet in height, a significant portion comprising at least 75 percent of the top floor shall be terraced and stepped back from the exterior face of the next lower floor by an average of at least five feet. Parking structures are exempt from this terracing requirement. 
(11)  Whenever the rear or side property lines within this district share a common property line with parcels zoned residential, either a solid wall or fence (other than wood) shall be provided along the entire common line. The wall or fence shall be six feet in height; except that such wall or fence shall be only three feet in height from the front setback line of the adjoining parcel to the front property line of the adjoining parcel. 
(12)  Development shall not exceed 85 percent impervious coverage in this district. 
(13)  Other code sections related to development that should be referenced include, but are not limited to, off-street parking regulations, maximum height map, general provisions, definitions, sign regulations (article IV), environmental protection (article V) (this section includes division 1, stormwater; division 6, tree preservation; division 8, landscape regulations; division 9, irrigation regulations; and division 10 exterior lighting), subdivision regulations (article VI), historic preservation (article VIII) and concurrency management regulations (article II).

Sec. 58-77. - Commercial (C-3A) district. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. Certain areas of the city that are close to residential areas are commercially zoned so as to meet the retail and service needs of the neighboring area. These neighborhood commercial areas have smaller market areas with businesses that predominantly cater to the needs of the immediate area versus depending upon the trade area of the entire community or larger area. As such, the types of businesses and the sizes of buildings permitted within this commercial zone must be sensitive to the adjacent residential environment and, thus, exclude those uses and building sizes which can negatively impact the surrounding residential area with traffic generation, parking, deliveries, noise and such. 
(b)  Permitted uses. All business uses and activities shall be conducted exclusively and wholly within an enclosed building except those uses permitted which are customarily conducted in the open such as off-street parking, plant and landscape garden sales and outdoor patio dining. Storage shall be limited to accessory storage of commodities sold at retail on the premises and storage shall be within a completely enclosed building. Some minimal display of bulk merchandise for sale within the business may be permitted outside and adjacent to an enclosed building but only if under a permanent covered building canopy but not to include vending machines. 
(1)  Retail businesses involving the sale of merchandise on the premises within enclosed buildings and excluding resale items (except for clothing) or pawn shops and liquor stores. Convenience stores but specifically excluding such stores that offer fuel sales; 
(2)  Establishments involved in the rendering of a personal or business service, including banks or similar financial institutions, barber shops, beauty and nail salons, cosmetic treatments, day care/schools, dry-cleaning establishments, theaters, and travel agencies. Tattoo, body art or fortune-telling businesses are prohibited; 
(3)  Funeral homes or mortuaries without incinerators; 
(4)  Business, financial, governmental, medical and professional offices, agencies and clinics; 
(5)  Off-street parking lot except not involving the parking or storage of construction equipment, trucks, drill rigs, etc., or for use by truck/van rental companies; 
(6)  Permanent recreational facilities within enclosed soundproof buildings but excluding adult video arcades; 
(7)  Blueprinting, photocopying and printing offices; 
(8)  Uses customarily incidental and accessory to the permitted uses, including the repair of goods of the types sold in stores, permitted. Such repair must be carried on within a completely enclosed building, may not be carried on as a separate business, and provided further that there shall be no manufacturing, assembling, compounding, processing or treatment of products, other than that which is clearly incidental and essential to the permitted uses; 
(9)  Churches, nonprofit organizations' halls/lodges and schools less than 5,000 square feet in size (see parking requirements for limitations). 
(c)  Conditional uses. The following uses may also be permitted as conditional uses following review by the planning and zoning commission and approval by the city commission in accordance with the provisions of this article. See section 58-90, conditional uses. 
(1)  Restaurants but excluding bars, taverns, cocktail lounges and liquor package stores. 
(2)  Office/showroom/warehouse use. 
(3)  Drive-in components of any business. 
(4)  Buildings over 10,000 square feet or any addition over 500 square feet to an existing building over 10,000 square feet or additions over 500 square feet to existing buildings that result in a building over 10,000 square feet in size. 
(5)  Any conditional use provided in the R-3 or R-4 districts if limited to the site and improvement regulations of this district. 
(6)  Any building with residential units as a component of the building. However, time shares are not permitted. 
(7)  Churches, nonprofit organizations' halls/lodges, and schools 5,000 square feet or larger in size. (See parking requirements for limitations). 
(d)  Minimum building site. There shall be no minimum lot area; however, the lot must have a minimum frontage of 50 feet on a street. 
(e)  Development standards. 
(1)  Any building constructed within this district shall adhere to the following minimum or required setbacks for front, rear and side yards. The front setback from all streets shall be a minimum of ten feet from the property line. Side yard setbacks shall be a minimum of five feet from each property line unless the parcel shares a common line with a residentially-zoned parcel, then a 15-foot setback shall be observed. The rear setback shall be a minimum of 30 feet from the property line. However, within the Hannibal Square Neighborhood Commercial District, as set forth in this section, new buildings shall have a required ten-foot front setback and may be permitted zero-foot side setbacks unless the parcel shares a common line with a residentially-zoned parcel, then a 15-foot setback shall be observed. For any required front setback, the distance may be increased upon the determination by the public works director and police chief that a traffic sight distance safety problem may exist to the extent necessary to correct the problem. 
(2)  If a person constructing a building within this district desires to combine the minimum side yard setbacks and provide them on only one side of the lot, a site plan showing the locations of the proposed building as well as the location of existing adjacent building must be submitted to the planning and zoning commission for approval prior to the issuance to a building permit to ensure sufficient compatibility with adjacent properties. This reduction to the required side setback, however, shall not be permitted if adjacent to a residentially-zoned parcel. 
(3)  The maximum floor area ratio and building lot coverage shall be 45 percent. The floor area ratio shall include the floor area of any attached or detached above-grade private parking garage. The 45 percent floor area ratio and building lot coverage may be increased by an additional five percent if the parking for the increased five percent floor area ratio is located entirely underground beneath the building's footprint or if the building's upper floor(s) are cantilevered over such parking. 
(4)  Exclusively residential buildings are not permitted. Residential units are not permitted on the first or ground floor. When residential units are included on the second floor or above, the floor area ratio of the project may be up to 60 percent FAR, but the maximum floor space that can be devoted to nonresidential (office) uses is 45 percent floor area ratio. Limited residential use of the first or ground floor of such buildings may be permitted when limited to the functions of entrance lobby/elevator/stair access, leasing or management office or residential amenity spaces such as health/fitness, meeting/activity room or storage. However, in no case shall more than 15 percent of the first or ground floor be devoted to these ancillary residential uses (not counting the area of parking garages). 
(5)  The maximum floor area ratios outlined above are not an entitlement and are not achievable in all situations. Many factors may limit the achievable floor area ratio, including limitations imposed by the maximum height map, concurrency management/level of service standards, physical limitations imposed by property dimensions and natural features as well as compliance with applicable code requirements such as, but not limited to, parking and internal circulation, setbacks, landscaping requirements, impervious lot coverage, design standards and on-site and off-site improvements and design amenities required to achieve land use compatibility. Land located across a street and/or separated from the building site shall not be included in the floor area ratio calculations. 
(6)  The maximum residential density shall not exceed 17 units per acre. 
(7)  Building heights (in stories) shall not exceed two stories, and shall not exceed a 30-foot height limit. 
(8)  Parapet walls, or mansard roofs functioning as parapet walls, may be added to the permitted building height but in no case shall extend more than five feet above the height limits in this subsection. Mechanical penthouses, mechanical and air-conditioning equipment, elevator/stair towers and related nonoccupied structures may be permitted to extend up to ten feet above the height limits in this subsection. Architectural appendages, embellishments and other architectural features may be permitted to exceed the roof heights specified in this section, on a limited basis, encompassing no more than 30 percent of the building roof length and area, up to eight feet of additional height, upon approval of the city commission, based on finding that said features are compatible with adjacent projects. 
(9)  Terracing and articulation requiring additional setbacks are required to create relief to the overall massing of the building facades. Such design features of building facade articulation are required at least every 60 feet, on average, along the primary building facades facing streets or the building frontage onto its primary parking lot area. 
(10)  Whenever the rear or side property lines within this district share a common property line with parcels zoned residential, either a solid wall or fence (other than wood) shall be provided along the entire common line. The wall or fence shall be six feet in height; except that such wall or fence shall be only three feet in height from the front setback line of the adjoining parcel to the front property line of the adjoining parcel. 
(11)  The maximum impervious coverage shall be 85 percent of any property. 
(12)  Other code sections related to development that should be referenced include, but are not limited to, off-street parking regulations, maximum height map, general provisions, definitions, sign regulations (article IV), environmental protection (article V) (this section includes division 1, stormwater; division 6, tree preservation; division 8, landscape regulations; division 9, irrigation regulations; and division 10, exterior lighting), subdivision regulations (article VI), historic preservation (article VIII) and concurrency management regulations (article II).

Sec. 58-78. - Limited industrial and warehouse (I-1) district. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. 
(1)  The city, although primarily a residential community, has certain areas which are undesirable for residential development. Therefore, this limited industrial and warehouse district is established to permit light industrial-type uses which will not, in any way, detract from the residential desirability of the city and the surrounding area. This district may not be utilized or located within the central business district or the Hannibal Square Neighborhood Commercial District. 
(2)  The district's regulations impose restrictions on the type of industrial activities permitted, limitations and controls on the emission of fumes, odors, and noise, and provisions with regard to height and size of buildings, maximum site coverage, and landscaping. This is done in order to protect and foster the residential desirability of the city and at the same time to permit location of industries which will tend to improve the city's economic base close to a labor supply. 
(b)  Permitted uses. All uses of land located within this district must not be obnoxious by reason of sound, fumes, repulsive odors and the like whether the same constitutes an actual nuisance or not, and the uses shall not, in any way, detract from the desirability of the city as a residential community. Permitted uses include: 
(1)  Warehouses and wholesale distribution of goods, wares, merchandise, articles, or substances, except those which are combustible, inflammable, explosive or likely to create fire, radiation, or explosive hazards to surrounding property; 
(2)  Administrative or executive offices of a business or industrial establishment; 
(3)  Engineering offices; 
(4)  Assembly of electronic instruments or devices, precision instruments and similar industries; 
(5)  Blueprinting, photocopying or printing office; 
(6)  Light and clean manufacturing operations which meet all the requirements of this article and are operated only within completely enclosed building; 
(7)  Research offices and laboratories; 
(8)  Storage building or yard which is incidental to a permitted use. Goods and equipment should be stored in fully-enclosed buildings, but if for the conduct of business they must be stored in a yard, then the yard must be fully screened from public view by a densely planted hedge, wall or fence measuring a minimum of six feet in height; 
(9)  Adult entertainment establishments if otherwise complying with the applicable Winter Park or Orange County adult entertainment code; 
(10)  All accessory uses which are customarily incidental to such industrial uses; 
(11)  Churches, nonprofit organizations' halls/lodges and schools (see parking requirements for limitations); 
(12)  Any use permitted in the C-3 district, except those including residential uses; 
(13)  Pain management clinics. 
(c)  Conditional uses. The following uses may also be permitted as conditional uses following review by the planning and zoning commission and approval by the city commission in accordance with the provisions of this article. See section 58-90, conditional uses. 
(1)  Lumberyard, building material storage yard or contractor's storage yard; 
(2)  Public utility facility such as storage yard, substation, and the like; 
(3)  Welding shop, automobile body shop, or metal-working shop; 
(4)  Drive-in components of any business; 
(5)  Buildings over 10,000 square feet or any addition over 500 square feet to an existing building over 10,000 square feet or additions over 500 square feet to existing buildings that result in a building over 10,000 square feet in size. 
(6)  Any conditional use allowed in the C-3 district, except those including residential uses. 
(d)  Development standards. 
(1)  Any building constructed within this district shall adhere to the following minimum or required setbacks for front, rear and side yards. The front setback shall be a minimum of 15 feet from the property line. Side yard setbacks shall be a minimum of five feet from each property line. The rear setback shall be a minimum of 30 feet from the property line. For any required front setback, the distance may be increased upon the determination by the public works director and police chief that a traffic sight distance safety problem may exist to the extent necessary to remedy the problem. The rear setback shall be waived for any lot having a railroad right-of-way as its rear lot line. Whenever a parcel zoned in this district abuts a residentially-zoned parcel, there shall be a minimum setback of 30 feet from each property line adjacent to the residentially-zoned property. If a loading and unloading area is to be in front of the building, the front setback shall be increased to 35 feet. 
(2)  If a person constructing a building within this district desires to combine the minimum side yard setbacks and provide them on only one side of the lot, a site plan showing the locations of the proposed building as well as the location of existing adjacent building must be submitted to the planning and zoning commission for approval prior to the issuance to a building permit to ensure sufficient compatibility with adjacent properties. This reduction to the required side setback, however, shall not be permitted if adjacent to a residentially-zoned parcel. 
(3)  The maximum floor area ratio and building lot coverage shall be 45 percent. The floor area ratio shall include the floor area of any attached or detached above-grade private parking garage. The 45 percent floor area ratio and building lot coverage may be increased by an additional five percent if the parking for the increased five percent floor area ratio is located entirely underground beneath the building's footprint or if the building's upper floor(s) are cantilevered over such parking or if it is for a hotel building. However, if a building is utilized only for warehouse or storage uses and less than ten percent of the floor area is utilized as office or administrative space, then the floor area ratio may be 100 percent and the maximum building lot coverage shall be 85 percent. 
(4)  This district does not permit any residential building or residential units as a component of any building. 
(5)  The maximum floor area ratios outlined above are not an entitlement and are not achievable in all situations. Many factors may limit the achievable floor area ratio, including limitations imposed by the maximum height map, concurrency management/level of service standards, physical limitations imposed by property dimensions and natural features as well as compliance with applicable code requirements such as, but not limited to, parking and internal circulation, setbacks, landscaping requirements, impervious lot coverage, design standards and on-site and off-site improvements and design amenities required to achieve land use compatibility. Land located across a street and/or separated from the building site shall not be included in the floor area ratio calculations. 
(6)  Building heights shall not exceed the height limits imposed by the maximum height map. For those properties within the geographic areas shown with a two-story maximum, the maximum building height shall be 30 feet; for those properties shown with a three-story maximum height, the maximum building height shall be 42.5 feet; for those properties shown with a four-story maximum height, the maximum building height shall be 55 feet; for those properties shown with a five-story maximum height, the maximum building height shall be 65 feet and for the properties shown permitting up to eight stories, the maximum height shall be 95 feet. Unless specifically approved by the city commission, based on a finding that the building is compatible with adjacent properties, properties with buildings developed with less than the maximum building stories shall nonetheless conform to the maximum height map for the applicable stories. For example, if a two-story building is developed within an area permitting a four-story building, the two-story building shall conform to the 30-foot height limit. Parking garage levels shall be counted as stories for each level except for any basement level or the open roof level. 
(7)  Parapet walls, or mansard roofs functioning as parapet walls, may be added to the permitted building height but in no case shall extend more than five feet above the height limits in this subsection. Mechanical penthouses, mechanical and air-conditioning equipment, elevator/stair towers and related nonoccupied structures may be permitted to extend up to ten feet above the height limits in this subsection. Architectural appendages, embellishments and other architectural features may be permitted to exceed the roof heights specified in this section, on a limited basis encompassing no more than 30 percent of the building roof length and area, up to eight feet of additional height upon approval of the city commission, based on a finding that said features are compatible with adjacent properties. 
(8)  For properties not designated on the maximum height map, the maximum height shall not exceed 55 feet when located adjacent to four-lane roadways and no greater than 42.5 feet when located adjacent to two-lane roadways. For corner properties adjacent to both four-lane and two-lane roadways the greater height may apply. 
(9)  Terracing and articulation requiring additional setbacks are required to create relief to the overall massing of the building facades as are appropriate for the building's architectural style. Such design features of building facade articulation are required at least every 60 feet along the facade of the primary building facades facing streets or the building frontage onto its primary parking lot area. For any building over two stories in height, a significant portion of the top floor shall be terraced and stepped back from the exterior face of the next lower floor by an average of at least five feet. Parking structures are exempt from this terracing requirement. 
(10)  Whenever the rear or side property lines within this district share a common property line with parcels zoned residential, either a solid wall or fence, shall be provided along the entire common line. The wall or fence shall be six feet in height; except that such wall or fence shall be only three feet in height from the front setback line of the adjoining parcel to the front property line of the adjoining parcel. 
(11)  The maximum impervious coverage shall be 85 percent of any property. 
(12)  Any above-grade parking garages or decks constructed within this district must be at least 100 feet away from any single-family or low-density residential property. 
(13)  Other code sections related to development that should be referenced include, but are not limited to, off-street parking regulations, maximum height map, general provisions, definitions, sign regulations (article IV), environmental protection (article V) (this section includes division 1, stormwater; division 6, tree preservation; division 8, landscape regulations; division 9, irrigation regulations; and division 10, exterior lighting), subdivision regulations (article VI), historic preservation (article VIII) and concurrency management regulations (article II). 
(e)  Minimum building site. There shall be no minimum building site area, but a parcel must have a minimum frontage on a publicly dedicated right-of-way of 50 feet. 
(f)  Other requirements. The code enforcement director of the city is empowered to investigate any uses or businesses within this district to determine if they are in conformity with the requirements of this article of not being obnoxious by reason of sound, fumes, heat, repulsive odors and the like, and to require those found not in conformity to rectify this situation immediately to the satisfaction of the city. 
(Ord. No. 2646-05, § 7, 9-12-05; Ord. No. 2796-10, § 1(Exh. A), 2-22-10; Ord. No. 2849-11, § 9, 9-12-11; Ord. No. 2874-12, § 3, 4-23-12; Ord. No. 2875-12, § 4, 6-11-12; Ord. No. 2981-14 , § 3, 10-27-14; Ord. No. 3081-17 , § 3, 8-14-17)

This district is generally intended to accommodate the activities of public agencies, governments, social service agencies, schools, community centers, utilities, museums, nursing homes/assisted living facilities and hospitals. This district is intended to provide the combination of public and quasi-public uses along with any customary residential accommodations that are generally a part of the primary function of the entity. New community facilities or expansions of facilities shall be permitted only when those facilities or the particular uses of the facilities are compatible with the character of the surrounding area, and when there is minimal additional impact over that generated by the existing land use, taking into account such factors as traffic, parking, noise, height and size of facilities. 
(b)  Permitted uses. The following buildings or uses and additions thereto are permitted uses: 
(1)  Schools and educational uses, including: 
a.  Elementary, junior high and high school, both public and private, including general education as well as vocational-technical schools; 
b.  Higher education institutions, including community and junior colleges, colleges and universities, and also incidental to the primary permitted use and as a convenience to the occupants of such properties, the following uses shall be considered permitted uses, to wit: dining halls, cafeterias, student centers, bookstores, copy stores, health centers, museums, theaters, and recreational facilities, pursuant to their approved master plans required by law.

These uses must be located within the primary structure (not within a separate structure) and must be primarily for the use and convenience of occupants of the building. These uses shall not have separate public entrances to the outdoors nor separate outdoor advertising signs or any other advertising signs which encourage use by the general public. The city commission may recommend other restrictions or requirements including a maximum floor area, which would allow these accessory commercial uses to be in harmony with the otherwise office environment and which would prevent these accessory uses from having an adverse effect on the surrounding area. 
(1)  Restaurant or cafeteria; 
(2)  Newspaper, card and gift shop, florist, fitness center or health club. 
(3)  Pharmacy store within a medical office building which sells prescription and nonprescription drugs, medicines and medically-related equipment only.

(f)  Development standards. 
(1)  Any building constructed within this district shall adhere to the following minimum or required setbacks for front, rear and side yards. The front setback shall be a minimum of ten feet from the property line. Side yard setbacks shall be a minimum of five feet from each property line unless the parcel shares a common line with a residentially-zoned parcel, then a 15-foot setback shall be observed. The rear setback shall be a minimum of 30 feet from the property line. However, within the Hannibal Square Neighborhood Commercial District, as set forth in this section, new buildings shall have a required ten-foot front setback and may be permitted zero-foot side setbacks unless the parcel shares a common line with a residentially-zoned parcel, then a 15-foot setback shall be observed. For any required front setback, the distance may be increased upon the determination by the public works director and police chief that a traffic sight distance safety problem may exist to the extent required to remedy the problem. 
(2)  If a person constructing a building within this district desires to combine the minimum side yard setbacks and provide them on only one side of the lot, a site plan showing the locations of the proposed building as well as the location of existing adjacent building must be submitted to the planning and zoning commission for approval prior to the issuance of a building permit to ensure sufficient compatibility with adjacent properties. This reduction to the required side setback, however, shall not be permitted if adjacent to a residentially-zoned parcel. 
(3)  The maximum floor area ratio and building lot coverage outside of the central business district shall be 45 percent. The floor area ratio shall include the floor area of any attached or detached above-grade private parking garage. The 45 percent floor area ratio and building lot coverage may be increased by an additional five percent if the parking for the increased five percent floor area ratio is located entirely underground beneath the building's footprint or if the building's upper floor(s) are cantilevered over such parking. Within the central business district, the maximum floor area ratio shall be 200 percent and the maximum building lot coverage shall be 85 percent. 
(4)  This district does not allow residential buildings except as accommodations for the uses permitted in this district, such as dormitories for colleges, hospital beds, nursing home beds, and assisted living accommodations. 
(5)  The maximum floor area ratios outlined above are not an entitlement and are not achievable in all situations. Many factors may limit the achievable floor area ratio including limitations imposed by the maximum height map, concurrency management/level of service standards, physical limitations imposed by property dimensions and natural features as well as compliance with applicable code requirements such as, but not limited to, parking and internal circulation, setbacks, landscaping requirements, impervious lot coverage, design standards and on-site and off-site improvements and design amenities required to achieve land use compatibility. Land located across a street and/or separated from the building site shall not be included in the floor area ratio calculations. 
(6)  Building heights shall not exceed the height limits imposed by the maximum height map. For those properties within the geographic areas shown with a two-story maximum, the maximum building height shall be 30 feet; for those properties shown with a three-story maximum height, the maximum building height shall be 42.5 feet, unless the property is located within the central business district, where the maximum height for three stories shall be 40 feet, when approved as a conditional use. Variances for more than three stories in the central business district are prohibited. For those properties shown with a four-story maximum height, the maximum building height shall be 55 feet; for those properties shown with a five-story maximum height, the maximum building height shall be 65 feet, and for the properties shown permitting up to eight stories, the maximum height shall be 95 feet. Unless approved as conditional uses by the city commission, properties with buildings developed with less than the maximum building stories shall nonetheless conform to the maximum height map for the applicable stories. For example, if a two-story building is developed within an area permitting a four-story building, the two-story building shall conform to the 30-foot height limit. Parking garage levels shall be counted as stories for each level except for any basement level or the open roof level. 
(7)  Parapet walls, or mansard roofs functioning as parapet walls, may be added to the permitted building height but in no case shall extend more than five feet above the height limits in this subsection. Mechanical penthouses, mechanical and air-conditioning equipment, elevator/stair towers and related nonoccupied structures may be permitted to extend up to ten feet above the height limits in this subsection. Architectural appendages, embellishments and other architectural features may be permitted to exceed the roof heights specified in this section, on a limited basis, encompassing no more than 30 percent of the building roof length and area, up to eight feet of additional height, upon approval of the city commission, based on a finding that said features are compatible with adjacent projects. 
(8)  For properties not designated on the maximum height map, the maximum height shall not exceed 55 feet, for properties located adjacent to four-lane roadways, and no greater than 42.5 feet for properties located adjacent to two-lane roadways. For corner properties adjacent to both four-lane and two-lane roadways, the greater height may be used. 
(9)  Terracing and articulation requiring additional setbacks are required to create relief to the overall massing of the building facades as are appropriate for the building's architectural style. Such design features of building facade articulation are required at least every 60 feet along the primary building facades facing streets, or along the building frontage where it fronts the primary parking lot area. For any building over two stories in height and over 200 feet in length, there shall be a 35-foot break on at least the first floor, the design of which shall be a component of the architectural review process required for conditional use. For any building over two stories in height, a significant portion of the top floor shall be terraced and stepped back from the exterior face of the next lower floor by at least an average of five feet. Parking structures are exempt from this terracing requirement. 
(10)  Development shall not exceed 85 percent impervious coverage in this district. 
(11)  Whenever the rear or side property lines within this district share a common property line with parcels zoned residential, either a solid wall or fence (other than wood) shall be provided along the entire common line.

Sec. 58-80. - Parking lot (PL) district. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. This district is established to provide areas for public or private parking lots within a zoning district that limits the permitted use only to surface parking and does not otherwise permit any other residential or nonresidential structures or buildings. This parking lot district then may be used to commit land to only a use as a surface parking lot. This zoning district may be utilized in any comprehensive plan future land use designation in the event of future redevelopment. Above-grade parking garages or decks are prohibited. 
(b)  Permitted uses. The following is the only permitted use: 
(1)  Surface parking lots including stormwater retention facilities but not parking garages or decks. 
(c)  Development standards. 
(1)  All parking lots shall meet the requirements of this article in terms of the design and construction, and other requirements as specified in the off-street parking and loading regulations and shall meet such other technical requirements as required by the city for traffic safety and visibility. 
(2)  For surface parking lots, development shall not exceed 85 percent impervious coverage in this district. 
(3)  Whenever the rear or side property lines within this district share a common property line with parcels zoned residential, either a solid wall or fence (other than wood) shall be provided along the entire common line. The wall or fence shall be six feet in height; except that such wall or fence shall be only three feet in height from the front setback line of the adjoining parcel to the front property line of the adjoining parcel. 
(4)  Other code sections related to development that should be referenced include, but are not limited to, off-street parking regulations, general provisions, definitions, sign regulations (article IV), environmental protection (article V) (this section includes division 1, stormwater; division 6, tree preservation; division 8, landscape regulations; division 9, irrigation regulations; and division 10, exterior lighting), subdivision regulations (article VI), historic preservation (article VIII) and concurrency management regulations (article II). 
(c)  Cross access easements. 
(1)  It is deemed to be in the public interest that private parking lots, under certain conditions be required by design and function to have inter-connectivity with other adjacent properties so that vehicles and traffic may have alternate means of access to side streets or away from residential streets thereby promoting traffic safety and energy efficiency. 
(2)  As a term and condition of the city granting parking lot (PL) zoning, the city may require and the owner be obligated to grant to the city, a perpetual easement through the proposed parking lot that would allow use by other adjacent owners so that parking lots are interconnected and achieve the public interest cited above. The city shall declare that intent to require such easement, at the time the zoning is granted, so that the owner may choose not to accept parking lot zoning if the easement is unacceptable to the owner. However, once adopted, the easement may not be vacated except by subsequent action by the city commission.

Rear yard setbacks shall be a minimum of 20 feet from each property line to any nonresidentially-zoned parcels and 35 feet to any residentially-zoned parcel. Based upon the size and scale of the building or structure, the city commission may impose greater setbacks as would be compatible with the characteristics of the adjacent properties. 
(3)  The maximum floor area ratio and building lot coverage shall be 20 percent for active recreational facilities and ten percent for passive recreational facilities. The maximum floor area ratios outlined above are not an entitlement and are not achievable in all situations. Many factors may limit the achievable floor area ratio, including limitations imposed by the maximum height map, concurrency management/level of service standards, physical limitations imposed by property dimensions and natural features as well as compliance with applicable code requirements such as, but not limited to, parking and internal circulation, setbacks, landscaping requirements, impervious lot coverage, design standards and on-site and off-site improvements and design amenities required to achieve land use compatibility. Land located across a street and/or separated from the building site shall not be included in the floor area ratio calculations. 
(4)  Building heights shall not exceed two story height limits and the maximum building height shall be 45 feet for buildings.

Sec. 58-84. - General provisions for nonresidential zoning districts. 
(a)  Suitability of buildings. Any proposed nonresidential building shall be considered as to its suitability of design and type of construction in relation to the district and to the immediate neighborhood site, and if such design or construction is markedly incongruous with the character of such neighborhood as to be detrimental to the value of adjacent or nearby properties, then the building director shall deny the application for a building permit. 
(b)  Grading of building site. 
(1)  Every lot which is used for a building site shall be so graded that it will be dry and free from standing water and the grade around the walls of every new building at the point where the sill meets these walls shall not be less than 12 inches above the crown line established or to be established for the street on which such a building faces, unless the lot has drainage away from the street to the lake or canal or has other adequate means of drainage as may be checked and approved by the city engineer at the request of the city building and zoning official. If the street on which the lot faces has a slope between lot lines, an elevation half-way between the high and low points is to be used for determining the height of crown line. 
(2)  No lot owner shall grade his lot in such a way as to interfere with the natural drainage of adjoining lots or divert the drainage of his lot onto adjoining lots nor to interfere with the natural drainage of any lot so that the drainage of such lot is diverted upon any public street or thoroughfare in such a manner or in such amounts as to flood such public street or thoroughfare. 
(c)  Architectural towers, spires, chimneys, or other architectural appendages, etc. 
(1)  Any architectural tower, spire, chimney, flag pole or other architectural appendage to a building shall conform to that districts height limit. However, when necessary to meet the building code requirements, chimneys may exceed the height by that minimum required distance.

(j)  Walls and fences. 
(1)  Permits. Requests for permits for walls and fences must be accompanied by a site plan and drawings clearly showing the locations, heights and materials for which approval is requested. 
(2)  Height in nonresidential districts. On all street frontages, walls and fences shall not exceed three feet in height except when setback at least ten feet from the property line. At or beyond that ten-foot setback or on other side or rear property lines, fences or walls may be up to six feet in height. No wall or fence shall be permitted which would in any way obstruct or impair the visibility of automobiles at intersections and points of ingress and egress to the public right-of-way. 
(3)  Designs and materials permitted in nonresidential districts. Fences or walls in nonresidential districts located within the front half of the lot shall not be constructed of chain link, chicken wire, wood (except decorative open pickets) or other similar or nondecorative materials. In any nonresidential districts, except industrial districts, barbed wire may not be incorporated in or used as a fence. Any barbed wire used within industrial districts shall be placed so that it does not project outward over any street, sidewalk, public way, or adjacent property. Fences and walls within nonresidential districts shall be designed and constructed so that adequate access to buildings is maintained for firefighting purposes. 
(4)  Walls shall be finished on both sides with similar architectural treatments and color on both surfaces so that, for example, a brick-veneered masonry wall shall have brick veneer on both sides or a stuccoed masonry wall shall have a stucco finish on both sides, unless different surface treatments and color are agreed upon by the property owners on both sides of the wall and the administrative official. 
(k)  Land and building uses seen generally. It is intended that all buildings hereafter erected, reconstructed, altered, enlarged, moved or maintained, and any existing building and the land upon which it sits shall be used only for the purpose permitted in the zone in which such building or land is located, and then only after applying for and securing all permits and licenses required. If any use is for any reason omitted from the list of those specified as permissible in each of the various districts designated in this article, or if ambiguity arises concerning the appropriate classification of a particular use within the meaning and intent of the article, a person may file a request for inclusion of a particular use within a particular district or for an interpretation if any ambiguity arises with the building director. It shall be the duty of the planning and zoning commission to ascertain all pertinent facts concerning such use and by resolution of record set forth its findings and the reasons for designating a specific classification for such use. Such findings and resolution shall be referred to the city commission and, if approved by the city commission, thereafter such designated classification shall govern. 
(l)  Solid waste containers. Prior to the issuance of a building permit, plans for the construction of any commercial, office, industrial, planned development or any other nonresidential buildings must show the location of container(s) for solid waste disposal. The number of containers, their location and access to them for unloading purposes are subject to the approval of the city. Solid waste containers or dumpsters shall be screened from view of surrounding properties for all new development. Recycling containers may be exempted from this requirement by the city. 
(m)  Relocation or moving a building. (See general provisions for residential districts for applicable regulations). 
(n)  Curb cut permits. Any proposed construction in zoning districts other than R-1AAA, R-1AA, R-1A and R-2 shall have its access points or curb cuts for off-street parking facilities approved by the building director. In all such cases where that use has an access point or curb cut onto one public street, no additional curb cuts may be made onto another public street without the approval of the building director. His approval shall be based on a finding that no additional traffic will be directed onto local residential streets. 
(o)  Vehicle/boat sales. There shall be required a minimum lot/parcel size of 10,500 square feet for any automobile/truck/motorcycle, other vehicle or boat sales business. This shall apply to new, used and leased vehicles or boats. It shall not apply to rental business providing daily-weekly rentals. In cases where vehicle/boat sales operations are proposed, the city shall use as guidance a ratio of one vehicle/boat on sale or display for every 560 square feet of net usable area in order to provide adequate space for employee/customer parking and to preclude excessive congestion of the property. 
(p)  Satellite dish antenna. 
(1)  Satellite dish-shaped antennae are permitted as accessory structures for properties within the nonresidential districts of the city. The number, location, and size of all satellite dishes on such properties shall be first subject to the site plan approval by the code enforcement director to insure that such satellite dishes are located in a manner to be not visible from any public street or visible as little as reasonably possible. 
(2)  A building permit shall be required for the installation of all satellite dishes so as to precipitate inspection for compliance with this section and for anchoring in accordance with the requirements of the building code. 
(3)  The above regulations shall only apply to satellite dish antenna greater than one meter in diameter. 
(q)  Underground utilities. 
(1)  It is the intent of the city to improve the aesthetic appeal of the city and the reliability of utility service by requiring that utility lines such as electric, telephone, cable TV, fiber optics and other utilities, be placed underground in conjunction with the construction of all new buildings. The implementation of underground utilities shall also be required as a component to the substantial renovation of any existing building. Substantial renovations shall be interpreted as when the building permit value of such renovations and/or additions exceeds 50 percent of the value of the existing improvements on the most current property tax roll. Property owners shall provide space on site within the private property or within the building for any necessary pad-mounted transformers and switch gear and shall screen such to the degree possible with landscaping or other approved screening when visible from the public right-of-way. 
(2)  The city recognizes that certain physical elements such as existing buildings, swimming pools, large trees and such may impose unreasonable hardships on property owner's compliance with the placement of utilities underground and for the location of transformers. Upon confirmation of these hardships by the utility companies, the building director may waive this requirement for such projects or may allow the waiver of up to two required parking spaces to be used for the required pad-mounted transformer and switch gear. 
(r)  Display of merchandise outside commercial buildings within the C-2 zoning district. Only within the central business district and the Hannibal Square business district, those properties which are zoned C-2 are allowed one display of merchandise to be located outside of a commercial business exclusive of beautification elements such as plants (that are not for sale). This display must be placed within two feet of the front wall or window of the building. This display must not block or impede pedestrian traffic or be placed on the public sidewalk and at least six feet of clear sidewalk width must remain for pedestrian traffic. This display must be no more than six feet in height and no more than two feet in width. The display must be safely secured and removed under windy conditions. The display must be removed when the business is not open. An outside display is not permitted if the business chooses to place an outdoor portable sign. 
(s)  Significant changes to buildings or approved plans. Various sections of this zoning article require approvals by the planning and zoning board and/or city commission. Within the section for conditional uses there are specific requirements defining significant changes for conditional uses. For all other types of approvals, the standards below will determine whether a significant change or substantial deviation shall be deemed to have occurred which then would require a subsequent review and approval for those changes by the planning and zoning board and/or the city commission as follows: 
(1)  When there is an increase in the height of a building of more than one foot; or 
(2)  When there is an increase in the square footage of a proposed building of more than 500 square feet; or 
(3)  When there is an increase in the impervious lot coverage of more than 1,000 square feet; or 
(4)  When there is a change in the architectural style of the building; or 
(5)  When there is a major shift or relocation of the site and floor plan(s) or distribution of uses within the building or major shift or relocation in the features of building location, stormwater retention, parking area and/or driveways; or 
(6)  When additional variances are requested that were not part of the original public record in the review by the planning and zoning board and/or the city commission; or 
(7)  When the planning director, building director or city commission believe a material change has been made to a plan detail that was critical to the consensus or decision made by the board or commission.

Sec. 58-85. - Maximum height map regulations. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. Notwithstanding the other applicable regulations within this article, this section is intended to establish special regulations and provisions governing building height which supplement the zoning height provisions outlined within the multifamily (R-4), office (O-1), office (O-2), commercial (C-1), commercial (C-2), commercial (C-3), commercial (C-3A), limited industrial (I-1), planned development (PD-1 and PD-2) and public, quasi-public (PQP) zoning districts by virtue of the adoption and establishment of a maximum height map. These regulations provide for and encourage compatible heights and densities in accordance with the comprehensive plan. 
(b)  Application. These height overlay regulations shall be applied to the areas designated office, commercial or other nonresidential zoning districts as depicted on the maximum height map. Except within the central business district, these provisions are not intended for areas designated residential in the comprehensive plan. However, these provisions may be utilized to allow residential uses to be developed within a project, provided the underlying zoning designation is limited to one of the districts outlined in subsection (a). 
(c)  Maximum height map adoption and implementation, Notwithstanding the heights as expressed in feet dimension as specified within the zoning districts' regulations, any property depicted on the maximum height map shall be restricted to the maximum number of building stories as set forth on that maximum height map. In other words, in the event of any conflict between the maximum height map and the heights allowed within the individual zoning districts' regulations, the maximum height map governs. Mezzanine or loft levels shall be considered an additional story. Parking garage levels shall be counted as stories for each level, except for any basement or open roof top level. 

(Ord. No. 2796, § 1, 2-22-10) 
Sec. 58-86. - Off-street parking and loading regulations. 
(a)  General. At the time of the erection of any building or structure, or at the time the property undergoes a change in use, or at the time any building or structure is enlarged or increased in capacity by the addition of dwelling units, guestrooms, square footage, floor area, seats, then the minimum off-street automobile parking spaces with adequate provisions for ingress and egress by automobiles of standards size shall be provided in accordance with the following requirements. These requirements should be considered the minimum requirements. The owners of each individual building or structure must assess their individual needs and provide sufficient parking spaces to accommodate their needs if they should exceed the required minimum established by this article. If desired, a property owner with a parking lot larger than 20 parking spaces may divide up to two parking spaces into four spaces to accommodate motorcycles or scooters. Parking lots are intended to meet the parking requirements for both the employees of the building and users of those buildings. As such, no property owner or tenant may prohibit by signage or policy the use of parking lots by their employees, unless remote off-site parking within 1,000 feet of the business is provided to such employees. Within the central business district, or any other location where parking is inadequate for any particular business, when there exists public parking lots or public parking garages, employees should be required to park within those off-street public parking facilities and not be permitted by the business to utilize on-street parking. 
(1)  Central business district exclusion. The following described area shall be known as the central business district for the provision of off-street parking spaces, and shall be exempt from furnishing parking facilities, as required by this article. This exemption is made because of the traditional exclusion from providing parking in central business districts and the existing development within the district. Property owners, however, are encouraged to provide off-street parking space whenever possible. 
Begin at the intersection of Lyman and New York Avenues, run thence east on Lyman Avenue to Knowles Avenue, thence north on Knowles Avenue to Canton Avenue, thence west on Canton Avenue to New York Avenue, thence south on New York and Lot 1-4, Block 14; Lots 1-4, Block 15, all Block 66; Lots 1-10 and 22, 23, Block 76; and Lots 1-8, Block 77, Town of Winter Park according to the plat thereof recorded in Public Records of Orange County, Florida. 
a.  The foregoing exclusion shall apply only to existing square footage or floor space. Parking shall be provided as required by this section for any net new building or net new floor space created by redevelopment, new construction, additions, alterations or remodeling or for any change in use requiring additional parking such as an office or retail space conversion to restaurant. Existing parking spaces may be counted to satisfy this requirement only where such existing spaces are in excess of the parking space requirements of this section for any existing floor space. 
b.  The foregoing exclusion shall not exempt properties within this exclusion area from compliance with subsection "Location of parking lots", which prohibits the use of remote leased parking to satisfy the parking requirements of any new building or new floor space. 
(2)  Hannibal Square District exclusion. 
a.  The following described area shall be known as the Hannibal Square District for the provisions of off-street parking spaces and shall be exempt from furnishing parking spaces and shall be exempt from furnishing parking facilities as required by this article. The Hannibal Square District shall include Lots 5-10, Block 42, Lots 11-13 and the west 50 feet of Lot 14, Block 41, Lots 1-6, Block 54 and Lots 8-10, Block 55, Town of Winter Park according to the plat thereof recorded in Public Records of Orange County, Florida. 
b.  On properties within this district that have existing buildings, as of January 1, 1998, the foregoing exclusion shall apply only to existing building square foot area. Such existing building square foot area may be renovated, reused and redeveloped even if it involves the demolition and subsequent reconstruction of a same size to the existing building square foot area without providing any off-street parking spaces. However, this exclusion shall not apply to additional building square footage or for any change in use requiring additional parking such as an office or retail space conversion to restaurant. Parking shall be provided, as required by this article, for any increase in building square foot area. Existing parking spaces may be counted to satisfy this requirement only where such existing spaces are in excess of the parking space requirements of this article for any existing building square foot area. 
c.  On properties within this district that are vacant, as of January 1, 1998, the foregoing exclusion shall be limited to the square footage of new building equal to 45 percent of the lot area. Parking shall be provided, as required by this article, for any additional building square foot area above the credit provided for the 45 percent of the lot area. In calculating this credit, the entire building's parking demand shall be reduced on a pro-rata basis for different uses within the building. 
(b)  Specific requirements for various uses and buildings. Listed below are the minimum parking spaces required for various buildings and uses. When the computation results in a requirement for a fractional space, a fraction of one-half or less shall be disregarded. When the fraction exceeds one-half, one additional off-street parking space will be required. Parking spaces, other than handicapped spaces, shall be nine feet wide by 18 feet deep. Variances to reduce the size of parking spaces are prohibited. The Central Business District, as specified in this section, shall be the geographic area depicted in the CBD Map D-2 within the Definitions section of this Code; the New England Avenue portion of the Hannibal Square Neighborhood Commercial District shall be the same as detailed in the Hannibal Square District exclusion area and the Orange Avenue Corridor shall include any property with frontage directly on Orange Avenue from Fairbanks Avenue to Orlando Avenue.

(19)  Office/showroom/warehouse: One parking space for each 350 square feet of gross floor space in the building devoted to office/showroom/use and one parking space for each 700 square feet of gross floor space in the building devoted to storage space. 
(20)  Residential dwellings. Two spaces per dwelling unit for any residential project of two units or less. Two and one-half spaces per dwelling unit for any residential project of three units or more. The planning and zoning commission may recommend and the city commission may approve variances to these provisions where conditions warrant. The intent of the Code requirement for two and one-half spaces for multiple family projects is to provide visitor parking spaces for guests, service calls, deliveries, etc. For multiple family projects providing two and one-half parking spaces per unit, the provision of those visitor spaces may not be exclusively within enclosed garages or carports and there must be at least one visitor parking space for each two units that are open and accessible for guests, service calls, deliveries, etc. Multiple family projects may not sell or lease any of the code required visitor parking spaces to individual unit owners or residents. In cases where the city may grant or has granted a variance or exception enabling the total parking spaces for any multiple family project to be less than the code required two and one-half spaces per unit, then at least 15 percent of the total number of parking spaces approved by the city must be made available as visitor parking. All such visitor parking spaces shall be clearly marked on the pavement or have signage provided, indicating their use for visitor parking. In cases where there is restricted access security or gates for resident parking, then such restricted access security or gates, etc., shall not prohibit access to the required number of visitor parking spaces. Parking necessary for on-site management or other on-site employees shall be provided in parking spaces in excess of the number required as visitor parking. The city's code enforcement board may enforce these provisions when it is witnessed by city staff that on any four consecutive occasions within any two consecutive day period, the same resident vehicle or management employee vehicle is utilizing any designated visitor parking spaces. 
(21)  Restaurants, food service establishments, nightclubs, taverns or lounges: One parking space for each 50 square feet of floor space for patron use on the premises or one space for every three seats, whichever is greater. However, within the Central Business District, along the Orange Avenue Corridor and within the New England Avenue portion of the Hannibal Square Neighborhood Commercial District, the minimum requirement shall be one space for every four seats. Establishments with 12 seats or less shall be classified as retail.

(27)  Warehouse use: One parking space for each 1,000 square feet of gross floor space in the building. 
(28)  Pain management clinics: One parking space for each 100 square foot of gross floor space in the building. 
(c)  General provisions for off-street parking. The off-street parking, loading and unloading requirements shall apply to all new structures or buildings or any existing buildings that may be altered or added to after the effective date of this article, except as otherwise provided in this article. The terms "existing spaces" or "existing parking facilities" used in this section shall mean all parking spaces servicing a particular building or use regardless of whether such spaces are located on the same property as the building or use or on another lot or property. 
(1)  Change in intensity of use. Whenever a building or structure erected prior to or after the effective date of this article shall undergo any increase in number of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity, number of employees or other unit of measure specified hereinafter for required parking or loading facilities and further, when such increase would result in the requirement for additional parking or loading facilities through application thereto of the off-street parking regulations and off-street loading and unloading regulations of this article, such additional parking and loading facilities shall be provided accordingly. When a building or structure shall undergo any decrease in number of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity, or other unit of measurement specified hereinafter for required parking or loading facilities, and further, when such decrease would result in a requirement for fewer total parking or loading spaces through application thereto of the off-street parking regulations of this article, parking and loading facilities may be reduced accordingly, provided that the existing parking and loading facilities shall be so decreased only when the facilities remaining would at least equal or exceed the parking or loading requirements resulting from application of this article to the entire building or structure so modified. At no time shall parking and loading facilities be decreased below the minimum requirements set forth in this article. 
(2)  Minimum distance and setbacks. 
a.  Multifamily and nonresidential districts. Parking spaces shall not be located within the required front yard. Parking spaces may be permitted by the building director if there is compliance with the requirements of subsection 58-345(e), "vehicle use area landscaping." The building director shall withhold final inspection approval of all the improvements on the property until required landscaping is installed. Such landscaping shall be continually maintained by the property owner. Any wall or fence erected in conjunction with the landscaping shall observe the setbacks and height restrictions for that zoning district. 
b.  Single-family, duplex, cottage dwelling, garage apartment and similar uses. Parking spaces established to meet the minimum requirements of this section shall not be located within any required front yard or required street side yard for the zoning district in which the parking spaces are located. Additionally, motorized vehicles shall not be parked on the grass, lawn, landscaped or unlandscaped areas (excluding approved driveway surfaces) along any street frontage and visible from the street. Parking must be provided within an area whose surface is specifically prepared for parking and surfaced with concrete, asphalt, brick or similar approved material delineating such parking space and must comply with the allowable impervious area for the property. 
(3)  Design, construction and operation of parking lots and parking garages. 
a.  Permit required. A building permit shall be required for the construction of all parking lots. No application for a building permit for a new, enlarged or altered structure or improvement, or for a certificate of occupancy for a new use, shall be approved unless accompanied by a plot plan drawn to scale, showing the required off-street automobile parking facilities and improvements as specified herein; nor shall a permit be issued for the improvement of a parking area to serve as an accessory use to an existing building or buildings until a plot plan drawn to scale has been submitted in accordance with the provisions contained herein. Prior to approval, the plot plan will be reviewed and approved by the public works director for drainage; the parks and recreation director for landscaping; city traffic engineer for vehicular circulation on the lot and on adjacent streets; and the building department for meeting all the requirements of this article, including the adequacy of the parking lot to accomplish its purpose and the requirements of the Florida Building Code accessibility provisions. 
b.  Surfacing and drainage. The parking lot shall be surfaced with brick, asphalt, concrete or other similar surface. Stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces shall be directed into stormwater retention areas or facilities on the lot. All parking lots shall be designed to meet the stormwater retention requirements of the St. Johns River Water Management District, when applicable or the city's stormwater retention requirement to retain the first inch of runoff from all impervious surfaces by using grassed swales, gravel trenches, filtered recharge wells, bottomless inlets, perforated pipe or other methods of providing natural percolation. All plans must include clear engineering calculations showing the method of design, including soil information, and existing as well as proposed topography. Where light-duty or infrequent use of the parking lot may make it desirable, the city may approve a grass or mulched surface. Should the use of this lot change appreciably, however, such that a grass or mulched surface is no longer adequate, the city may require the lot to be resurfaced with a more durable material. The location of individual parking spaces shall be clearly marked. 
c.  Certificate of occupancy or business tax receipt. No certificate of occupancy or business tax receipt will be issued after the completion of any building or addition which would require an increase in parking space or off-street loading and unloading space, unless and until all off-street parking and loading space requirements, shown on plans or made a part of the building permit, shall be in place and determined by the building director to be ready for use. 
d.  Existing uses. Nothing in this article shall prevent the reconstruction, repairing, rebuilding or continued use of any nonconforming building or structure existing at the effective date of this article which was damaged by fire, collapse, explosion or acts of God subsequent to such effective date. 
e.  Dumpster space. Every parking lot shall provide a space for a dumpster or other solid waste container unless said requirement is waived by the city. 
f.  Location of parking lots. Parking spaces provided pursuant to this section for any new building or building additions or increase in intensity of use, located in the area bounded by Swoope, New York, Fairbanks and Interlachen Avenues shall be on the same property as the principal building or on a remote, properly zoned lot within 750 feet that is in the same ownership as the principal building/property and permanently dedicated and recorded as committed to parking uses. For other properties located outside of this area, parking provided pursuant to this section may be located on a remote, properly zoned lot within 750 feet of the building, where such parking to be leased is in excess of the parking requirements for that building. Such distance shall be the walking distance measured from the nearest point of the parking lot to the nearest boundary of the lot on which the building is located that such parking lot is required to serve. In the event of new construction, addition, or change in intensity of use of the principal building or property being serviced by the remote parking lot, all existing parking spaces located on such remote lot shall be allocated to the existing building or principal use to meet the minimum requirements of this article, and any additional spaces may then be allocated to that portion of the building or property which is the subject of the new construction, addition, or change in intensity of use. 
g.  Collective action relative to off-street parking and loading. Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent the joint use of off-street parking or off-street loading space for two or more buildings or uses in the total of such spaces, when used together, shall not be less than the sum of the requirements for the various individual uses computed separately in accordance with the off-street parking regulations and off-street loading and unloading regulations of this article. 
h.  Mixed uses and shared parking. In the case of mixed uses and shared parking, the total requirements for off-street parking and loading spaces shall be the sum of the requirements of the various uses computed separately as specified in the off-street parking regulations and off-street loading and unloading regulations of this article. The off-street parking and off-street loading space for one use shall not be considered as providing the required off-street parking and/or off-street loading space for any other use unless specifically provided for based upon the entire time period of usage and need as supported by the Urban Land Institute's Methodology for Shared Parking Exclusion report, as may be amended. In any multi-family building or mixed use building or project, that includes residential units, constructed after September 1, 2107, at least one of the required parking spaces provided for each residential unit shall be dedicated and reserved for each particular residential unit and shall be provided to each residential unit at no additional cost as part of a monthly or other lease term other than as included in the base lease rate applicable to all other similar units and shall not be an additional cost for purchase over the agreed upon purchase price of the residential unit. 
i.  Use of required off-street parking by another building. No part of an off-street parking lot required for any building or use for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this article shall be included as a part of an off-street parking area similarly required for another building or use unless the type of structure indicates that the periods of usage of such structures will not be simultaneous or unless the size of said off-street parking lot is sufficient to comply with the provisions of this article. 
j.  Off-site parking and remote parking lots encumbered. Where the provisions of off-street parking for a building or other use established subsequent to the adoption of this article involves one or more parcels or tracts of land that are not a part of the site on which the principal use is situated, the applicant for a permit for the principal use shall submit his application for a building permit, and an instrument duly executed and acknowledged, which subjects that parcel or tract of land to parking uses in connection with the principal use for which it is available. The initial term of this instrument shall be at least ten years in length. The instrument shall not be acceptable if the agreement can be terminated by either party, unless such termination is conditioned and predicated on the coincident termination of the use that necessitated the instrument agreement for parking. When a principal use has encumbered a remote parking lot in accordance with the regulations outlined herein to provide the required minimum parking spaces, then hereafter, the business tax receipt for the principal use will not be renewed by the city until the owner of the subject building presents sufficient evidence to the city that the required spaces will be provided for said use. The applicant shall cause said instrument to be recorded in the office of the clerk of the circuit court of Orange County, Florida. A certified copy of the instrument shall be provided to the city at the time of application for a building permit or, if no building permit is required, upon the application for a business tax receipt for a use that must provide additional parking under this article. Such encumbrance shall be null and void and of no effect, if and when the city shall rescind or terminate off-street parking requirements for the building to be served by the encumbered lot, parcel or tract. 
k.  Accessory parking in residential areas. A lot or lots separated by common boundary from an office or commercial district but located in an R-3 and R-4 multiple-family dwelling district may be used as a conditional use or as otherwise permitted by this article, provided, however, that: 
1.  No advertising signs are erected in the area; 
2.  The setback from the front property line shall be the same as for the district in which the lot or lots are located; 
3.  All automobile parking lots shall be effectively screened on each side which adjoins or fronts property situated in any residential or multiple dwelling district by a wall, fence or densely planted compact hedge. Such wall, fence or hedge shall be not less than four feet in height and shall be maintained in good condition; any landscaped buffer strip shall be continually maintained; 
4.  No structure shall be erected in such area. 
l.  Off-street loading and unloading regulations. On the same premises with every building, structure or part thereof, erected and occupied for manufacturing, storage, warehouse, food processing or wholesale distribution plant, goods display, department store, wholesale store, market, hotel, hospital, mortuary, laundry, dry cleaning or other uses similarly involving the receipt or distribution by vehicles, of materials and merchandise, the city may require that there shall be provided and maintained on the lot adequate space for the standing, loading and unloading services in order to avoid undue interference with public use of the streets and alleys. Such space unless adequately provided elsewhere on the lot, shall include a minimum of 12 feet by 55 feet load space with a 14-foot minimum height clearance for every 20,000 square feet or fraction thereof in excess of 3,000 square feet of land for the above-mentioned purposes. Such loading space shall not be counted toward meeting the required parking for the building or business. 
m.  Limited leasing of parking facilities. Existing parking facilities which have been provided and approved by the building director for a principal building of use shall not be leased to any party other than the owner or operator of such principal use, except that those spaces in excess of the requirements of this article may be leased to parties other than the owner or operator of the principal use. 
n.  Parking garages. Parking garages shall be designed, constructed and maintained in accordance with the parking garage design guidelines outlined in sections 58-71 and 58-84 of this article. For any parking garage or deck there shall be at least two car lengths (35 feet) of stacking or queuing required whenever there is a parking ticket device or entrance gate so that such stacking does not extend over a public sidewalk or street. No parking ticket device or gate may be added to an existing parking garage unless this requirement is satisfied. 
o.  Parking garage management plans. The construction of any parking garage shall require the submission and approval by the city of a Parking Management Plan (PMP). The PMP shall include, at a minimum, the following elements: 
1.  The PMP shall include any method of charging for use of the parking structure and the proposed charges to be incurred for use of the parking garage. Without the express approval of the city, the parking garage shall not charge any fees in any manner to park within the parking garage or include charges to tenants for the ability to park within the parking garage. Any proposal to change for parking either directly or indirectly with tenant leases shall include the method by which visitors to the residential units or customers/clients to the businesses shall be entitled to park without payment of fees so that such visitors/customers/clients are not incentivized to park off-site on streets or other properties. 
2.  The PMP shall also include and require the city approval of signage and the location of such signage that reserves parking for specific tenant business usage. The city may require that such reserved parking signage provide for the public use of those spaces at nights or on weekends when such businesses are closed in order to facilitate the public benefit of the parking structure. 
3.  The PMP shall also include the contacts for the property management company responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the parking structure. Any dangerous or unsightly conditions such as trash, broken glass or graffiti shall be remedied with 48 hours of contact from the city or the failure to remedy shall be immediate grounds for action by the code enforcement board. 
It shall be the responsibility of the owner(s) of the parking structure to request approval of any amendment to the PMP and no changes to the operations of the parking garage shall be undertaken without such consent. 
Both the owner(s) of the parking structure and the city may seek amendments or changes to the PMP. The city may seek changes to the PMP when the operation of the parking garage creates situations that adversely affect the city or other property owners. 
p.  Drainage. The owner(s) and the owner's engineer of record shall be responsible for ensuring proper design and construction of stormwater drainage systems and improvements to accommodate stormwater drainage associated with parking garages, structures and lots. The owner(s) and their successors and assigns shall be responsible for ensuring the proper operation, maintenance and repairs of all private stormwater drainage systems and improvements that accommodate stormwater drainage parking garages, structures and lots. Owner(s) shall take particular caution when designing and construction parking garages and structures that are below grade and related stormwater systems and improvements to adequately address stormwater flows from adjacent public and private lands and public rights-of-way as stormwater drainage could flow down grade into such parking garages and structures. The city is not responsible for stormwater drainage flows (or for preventing the same) into below grade parking garages and structures. The city and its officers, employees and agents shall be held harmless by the owner(s) and its successors and assigns from any and all stormwater drainage issues relating to parking garages, structures and lots, including but not limited to, in regards to below grade parking garages and structures which may receive stormwater flows from adjacent private or public properties and public rights-of-way. The city's approval of plans and issuance of permits and inspections approvals concerning parking garages, structures and lots or any stormwater drainage systems or improvements relating thereto shall not be construed as a guarantee, warranty or representation by the city or any of its officers, employees or agents that the owner's or owner's engineer of record's design plan is going to properly function or prevent stormwater drainage problems, or that the improvements are properly constructed or constructed in accordance with the applicable design plan or permits. 
(4)  Driveways serving as access to parking areas or other areas accessed from streets. Vehicular access to parking areas or other areas being accessed by motorized vehicles from a public or approved private street is not permitted unless an approved driveway apron is constructed in the public right-of-way from the abutting street to the adjacent property after obtaining the required permit and meeting all requirements and standards of the public works department. 
(5)  Bicycle parking. 
a.  Intent and purpose. The purpose of these regulations is: 
1.  To provide for bicycle access to employment, commercial, and other transportation and travel destinations; and

2.  Whenever possible, the racks should be placed within 50 feet of the building entrances where bicyclists would naturally transition to a pedestrian mode of travel. Otherwise, signage at the building entrance should direct bicyclists to rack location. If a separate employee entrance exists, bicycle racks should be located near the employee entrance as well as the patron entrance. 
3.  Rack placement shall not impede pedestrian or vehicular circulation, and should be harmonious with their environment both in color and design. Parking facilities should be incorporated whenever possible into building design or street furniture. 
4.  Required bicycle parking spaces shall be at least two feet by six feet per bicycle. 
5.  An aisle of a minimum of five feet wide shall be provided behind bicycle parking facilities to allow for maneuvering. 
6.  All lockers and racks must be securely anchored to the ground or the building structure to prevent racks and locker removal from the location. 
7.  Structures requiring a user supplied locking device shall be designed to accommodate both chain and U-shaped locking devices and shall support the bicycle frame at two locations (not just the wheel). 
8.  Bike parking facilities within auto parking areas shall be separated by a physical barrier to protect bicycles from damage by cars, such as curbs, wheel stops, bollards or other similar features. 
f.  Exceptions. 
1.  Where the provision of bike parking is physically not feasible, the requirements may be waived or reduced to a feasible level by the building department's plan reviewer. The pedestrian and bicycle advisory board will review these decisions twice a year and make recommendations to said reviewer for the provision of bicycle parking spaces and the implementation of this subsection. 
2.  In special bicycle parking districts, as outlined below, a fee in lieu of providing bicycle parking will be required based on the parking specifications outlined herein. This fee will be used towards placement of bicycle parking in these zones, to be designated by the city planner. 
i.  Special bicycle parking districts. 
Park Avenue Bicycle Parking District: The area bounded by Fairbanks Avenue to the south, Center Street to the east, New York Avenue to the west, and Swoope Avenue to the north. 
(Ord. No. 2501-03, § 4, 1-28-03; Ord. No. 2642-05, § 1, 8-8-05; Ord. No. 2660-06, § 1, 1-23-06; Ord. No. 2796-10, § 1(Exh. A), 2-22-10; Ord. No. 2874-12, § 3, 4-23-12; Ord. No. 2875-12, §§ 4, 5, 6-11-12; Ord. No. 3098-17 , § 2, 12-11-17; Ord. No. 3126-18 , §§ 1-4, 11-12-18) 
Sec. 58-87. - Lakefront lots, canalfront lots, streamfront lots, boathouses and docks. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. It is the intent of this section to insure that buildings and structures on canalfront lots, lakefront lots and streamfront lots are not constructed or placed such that boating hazards will be created, that construction shall be compatible with the natural grade of the property, that water pollution from stormwater runoff and other sources will be minimized, that views of water from adjoining properties will not be unduly impaired, that existing trees shall be preserved to the degree reasonably possible and the appearance of the property and the shore when viewed from the water will be kept as natural as reasonably possible. The city's lakes, canals and streams are among the city's greatest assets, and it is in the public interest to require that their aesthetic appeal and water quality be maintained and enhanced when possible. 
(b)  Building plans. 
(1)  A building permit shall not be issued for any new structure or building, addition to any existing structure or building, fence or wall or significant change to an existing property on a lakefront, canalfront or streamfront lot until satisfactory building plans are reviewed and approved that are deemed in compliance with the objectives established in the aforementioned purpose and intent. The planning department shall review all such plans and provide a recommendation to the planning and zoning board. 
(2)  In cases involving the construction of swimming pools (without screen pool enclosures), or patios, or hardscape additions of under 1,000 square feet, the planning department shall provide an administrative review which will result in approval, approval with conditions or denial of the permit. In such cases, the owner may appeal the planning department's determinations to the planning and zoning board. 
(3)  In all other cases, the planning and zoning board shall review and approve construction upon lakefront lots, canalfront lots and streamfront lots when deemed in compliance with the objectives established in the aforementioned purpose and intent. 
(4)  The lakes and waterways board shall review and approve construction of boathouses, docks, gazebos over the lakes or other water bodies. However, review and approval by the lakes and waterways board of boathouses, docks and gazebos shall not be required if the structure is replacing an existing boathouse, dock or gazebo and is in the same location and is meeting the code requirements set forth in this section. The review and approval by the lakes and waterways board is only required when variances are requested or when there is not an existing boathouse, dock or gazebo on the property/water or when the location of the boathouse, dock or gazebo is being changed by more than five feet from the current location. 
(5)  The requirements of this section are minimum requirements, and the planning and zoning board or the lakes and waterways board may impose more restrictive requirements and conditions on the height, bulk, location and any other aspect of the proposed development where necessary in order to accomplish the purpose and intent of this section. Review by the planning and zoning board or the lakes and waterways board shall be at a public hearing following notification of adjacent waterfront property owners. 
(c)  Docks and boathouses. The following minimum or maximum standards shall apply to all construction or renovation of docks and boathouses: 
(1)  Before a building permit is issued, the plans for docks and boathouses shall be approved by the lakes and waterways board after review of comments from city staff and notification of the adjacent lakefront property owners. 
(2)  The total area of docks and boathouses built at the water's edge over land and water shall not exceed 600 square feet. In the case of canalfront lots (other than boathouse lots on canals as set forth in subsection (f) hereafter), the maximum total area of docks, boathouses, decks, stairs and any other attachments shall be based on the length of the canal frontage as follows: 
a.  Seventy-five feet or less of frontage, 450 sq. ft. 
b.  Seventy-six feet to 100 feet of frontage, 500 sq. ft. 
c.  Over 100 feet of frontage, 550 sq. ft. 
The maximum width of canal boathouses shall be 20 feet. 
(3)  All new docks and boathouses shall be constructed ten feet from a side lot line. This side setback can be reduced to five feet if written approval is presented from the adjacent property owners. 
(4)  All new docks and boathouses shall not extend over 30 feet into the water from the elevations specified in this section. However, on Lake Killarney the maximum distance may be 50 feet. 
(5)  The highest point of a boathouse or gazebo roof or any railing shall not exceed 11 feet and the roofs must be pitched so as to eliminate flat roofs and use of such areas as sundecks. The height shall be measured from the surface of the dock or floor to the highest point of the roof or railing. In addition, the surface of any dock, sundeck or floor of any boathouse, gazebo, etc., shall not be more than two feet above the elevations specified in this subsection. 
(6)  In order that all docks or boathouses be utilized only for boating and other recreational activities and not as living space, there shall be no bathrooms or cooking facilities permitted in them, nor as an improvement to any existing boathouse. There also shall not be any enclosed rooms over water except for storage rooms limited in size to a maximum of 80 square feet. 
(7)  Only one boathouse shall be permitted for each lakefront property owner. In the case of common ownership of lakefront property such as in a condominium arrangement or property owned by a subdivision, there shall only be one boathouse permitted. 
(8)  The sale or lease of a portion of lakefront after January 1, 1980, shall be construed as a subdivision and shall not enable the owners to make application for a dock and boathouse unless that subdivision has received the approval of the city commission. 
(9)  Canal boathouses shall be located so as not to interfere with navigation and to result in the minimum loss of existing large oak, pine or cypress trees. Electric service shall be provided via underground wiring. On lots that are divided by a public street, landscape buffering shall be required to substantially cover 50 percent of the structure as viewed from the street. Boathouses shall only be painted or have exterior covering of a color that blends in with and does not detract from the natural surroundings. Off-street parking areas shall remain without asphalt, concrete, brick, gravel, grass paver or other improved surface. 
(10)  As a condition for a permit to build or repair any lakefront dock or boathouse, the lakefront water area along shorelines that do not meet the vegetation standards of subsection 114-6(a) of this Code shall be required to be planted so that no more than 50 feet, or 50 percent (whichever is less) of the shoreline remains clear of vegetation. 
(d)  Other structures on lakefront, canalfront or streamfront lots. The following standards shall apply to all construction on lakefront, canalfront or streamfront lots: 
(1)  Lakefront, canalfront and streamfront lots shall be developed to maximize the amount of natural rainfall which is percolated into the soil and to minimize direct overland runoff into the water. With the exception of boathouses, docks or other over-water construction, storm water runoff from structures and other impervious surfaces shall be directed into swales or terraces on the lot or restrained by berms so as to provide for the on-site retention and percolation of the first one inch of runoff. Properties being developed or redeveloped shall eliminate any direct piped discharges of storm water into the water, so that this runoff is directed to the on-site retention and percolation areas. The planning and zoning board may require, as conditions necessitate, the submission of soil and water table information, topographic detail, drainage calculations and professionally designed plans so as to insure these requirements are met. All storm water retention compliance shall prioritize the preservation of existing trees and the impacts of fill or excavation on tree root systems shall be minimized and the planning and zoning board shall have the authority to require berm or alternative retention methods and volumes where necessary to protect the root systems and survivability of existing oak and cypress trees. 
(2)  No lakefront, canalfront or streamfront lot owner shall grade the lot in such a way as to interfere with the natural drainage of adjoining lots or in a way that diverts drainage from their lot onto adjoining lots. The planning and zoning commission may require, as conditions necessitate, the construction of physical features, grading, swaling and piping of roof gutters so as to insure that runoff on a lot does not negatively impact adjoining lots. 
(3)  Structures on lakefront, canalfront or streamfront lots shall, to the extent reasonably possible, be designed and located to minimize their obstruction or degradation of traditional views to and through the property to the water. Structures in this context shall also include fences and walls. Structures shall also be located so that existing trees shall be preserved to the degree reasonably possible. The planning and zoning board, may as conditions necessitate, reduce the height of structures, alter their location, size and design so as to accomplish these objectives. The planning and zoning board shall also have limited authority to grant exceptions to the front and side setback standards when deemed necessary to accomplish these objectives. 
(4)  Structures on lakefront, canalfront or streamfront lots shall be developed and landscaped so that when viewed from the water, those structures are as unobtrusive as is reasonably possible. When a lot is being redeveloped, or a lot's structure is being extended or altered, the planning and zoning commission may require the planting of new trees and other landscaping in order to achieve this objective. To the extent practical, vehicles shall not be visible from the lake. To achieve this objective, the parking of vehicles in any area between the rear of the principal building and the water shall be prohibited. Driveways and other parking surfaces for vehicles when located on the side of lots shall be screened by walls or fences (not including wood fences) or landscaping at least four feet in height that can effectively screen the view of the vehicles from the lake. This shall not apply to driveways and parking areas in the front of the lot that may be situated such that vehicles are visible from the lake. 
(5)  Structures on lakefront lots require the approval of the planning and zoning board prior to the issuance of a building permit. As conditions necessitate, the planning and zoning board or city commission may impose increased setbacks in concert with their waterfront review or conditional use authority as necessary to accomplish the objectives in this section. Structures in this context shall also include parking lots, driveways, swimming pools, cabanas, gazebos, screen enclosures, tennis courts and other accessory buildings. 
a.  Setbacks - Single family/duplex. The setback from the water's ordinary high water elevation for single family and duplex buildings and any other accessory structures on those properties (other than boathouses, docks, over the water gazebos or retaining walls) shall be the average established by the adjacent water front properties within 200 feet of the subject property, or 50 feet, whichever is greater. The planning and zoning board shall have the authority to approve water front setbacks less than the average determined above to a minimum of 50 feet in accordance with their water front review authority. 
b.  Setbacks - Multi-family/non-residential/mixed use. The water front setback from the ordinary high water elevation for multi-family (three or more units) or non-residential or mixed use buildings and any other accessory structures on those properties (other than boathouses, docks, over the water gazebos or retaining walls) shall correspond to the height of the proposed structure. For buildings and structures 35 feet in height or less, the water front setback shall be a minimum of 75 feet. As the height of the building or structure increases, for each one foot increase in height over 35 feet in height, the water front setback shall increase by two and one-half feet. Parking lots, driveways, swimming pools or other accessory structures shall be setback a minimum of 50 feet from the ordinary high water elevations below. 
c.  Ordinary high water elevations. For convenience, the ordinary high water elevations of the city's principal lakes are listed below. These elevations have been determined by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) Bureau of Survey and Mapping. All elevations reference NGVD (88 datum). For the canal and stream front locations, the ordinary high water elevations are to be provided by the public works department. 
1.  Lake Berry ..... 69.4 feet 
2.  Lake Killarney ..... 82.0 feet 
3.  Lake Maitland ..... 65.7 feet 
4.  Lake Mizell ..... 65.7 feet 
5.  Lake Osceola ..... 65.7 feet 
6.  Lake Sue ..... 70.7 feet 
7.  Lake Sylvan ..... 71.2 feet 
8.  Lake Virginia ..... 65.7 feet 
9.  Lake Bell ..... 88.6 feet 
10.  Lake Spier ..... 89.7 feet 
11.  Lake Forrest ..... 100.0 feet 
12.  Lake Grace ..... 100.8 feet 
13.  Lake Rose ..... 87.8 feet 
14.  Lake Tuscany ..... 69.1 feet 
15.  Lake Baldwin ..... 90.7 feet 
16.  Lake Temple ..... 66.6 feet 
(6)  Structures on canalfront or streamfront lots require the approval of the planning and zoning board prior to the issuance of a building permit. Other than boathouses, the waterfront setback shall be at least 50 feet from the canal bulkhead or stream. Structures in this context shall also include driveways, parking lots, swimming pools and pool decks, screen enclosures, tennis courts, cabanas and other accessory buildings. Swimming pools and decks on canalfront or streamfront lots may be permitted a minimum of 25 feet from the canal bulkhead or stream ordinary high water elevation, provided the swimming pool has an elevation of no more than two feet above the existing grade on the side closest to the canal or stream. The planning and zoning board may require, as conditions necessitate, the imposition of increased setbacks to accomplish the objectives in this section. 
(7)  Fences or walls on lakefront, canalfront, or streamfront lots shall not be permitted to extend into the water beyond the ordinary high water elevation or into a canal beyond the bulkhead. Fences and walls shall not be permitted which run parallel to or across the lakefront, canalfront or streamfront anywhere within the 50-foot setback from the ordinary high water elevation. Fences but not walls may be permitted which run parallel to or across the lakefront, canalfront or streamfront on that portion of the land between the rear of the main structure and the 50-foot setback provided such fence does not exceed four feet in height above existing grade. Retaining walls, terrace walls, decks, railings or other structures higher than three feet above existing grade shall not be permitted within the 50-foot setback. Other accessory structures or improvements that do not exceed three feet in height within the 50-foot setback such as walkways, railings, patios, decks, fire pits, etc., shall not cover more than ten percent of the land area within that 50-foot setback. Fences running down the sides of properties within the 50-foot setback or parallel to or across the waterfront shall be substantially open fences limited to the materials such as aluminum picket, wrought iron, or green or black cladded vinyl chain link which allow visibility across property lines and to the water. Wood shadow box fences shall not qualify as open fencing. The planning and zoning board may permit fences closer than the 50 feet but only on canalfront or streamfront lots as necessary to enclose swimming pools. 
(8)  Swimming pool and spa decks, patios and terraces shall not be constructed more than three feet in height above the average existing grade elevation on the lakeside edge of that deck, patio or terrace. In addition, the facade of these retaining walls facing the lake shall be screened with landscape plantings across the length of the retaining wall except for any sections involving stairs down to the lakefront. On lots with severe grade drops of over seven feet throughout the length of the house, the planning and zoning board may approve swimming pool and spa decks, patios and terraces higher than three feet above existing grade on the water side if approved by four members of the planning board. 
(e)  Retaining walls or seawalls. The construction of retaining walls or seawalls shall be done in accordance with the Lakeshore Protection regulations within this Code of Ordinances. 
(f)  Boathouse lots on canals. The boathouse lots which exist along the canals interconnecting the lakes within the city were platted and accepted by the city under the premise that these lots would serve as lake access for the residents of that subdivision. As such, the purpose and intention of these boathouse lots is to serve as accessory lots to the main residential properties within that subdivision. In accordance with the policies contained within the comprehensive plan, the following regulations shall apply: 
(1)  The buildability and use of all canal boathouse lots, which are determined to be accessory lots, shall be restricted to the owners of real property within the subdivision in which these accessory boathouse lots were platted. 
(2)  Canal boathouse lots which are held January 1, 1981, by property owners residing outside of the subdivision for which they are platted shall be nonconforming boathouse lots which may still be used for constructing a boathouse and for lake access. However, any canal boathouse lots owned by real property owners on January 1, 1981, in the subdivision for which they were platted, shall only be buildable and used to serve the lake access needs of residents of that subdivision. 
(3)  Minimum lot widths shall be 50 feet. 
(4)  Canal boathouses shall be constructed a minimum of five feet from side lot line. There shall be no front setback. 
(5)  The highest point of a canal boathouse shall be no more than ten feet above the ordinary high water elevation of the closest lake as detailed in this section. 
(6)  Canal boathouses shall not exceed 400 square feet in size for all areas of boathouses, stairs, and decking. 
(7)  Canal boathouses shall be located so as not to interfere with navigation and to result in the minimum of loss of existing large oak, pine or cypress trees. Electric service shall be provided via underground wiring. Landscape buffering shall be required to substantially cover 50 percent of the structure as viewed from the street. Boathouses shall only be painted or have exterior covering of a color that blends in with and does not detract from the natural surroundings. Off-street parking areas shall remain without asphalt, concrete, brick, gravel, grass paver or other improved surface. 
(g)  Wetlands. Located adjacent to certain streams, lakes and canals are wetland areas, as defined by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD) methodology, soil types, hydrological requirements and vegetation types in which no adding of soil or other fill materials shall be permitted. In addition, the use of these wetland areas for any structure shall be permitted only as a conditional use granted only upon the affirmative vote of four members of the city commission and said structures shall be limited to elevated boardwalks or gazebos. The criteria utilized to evaluate such conditional use requests shall include, but not be limited to: the effect on the wetland's function; environmental impacts on the wetlands from the construction process; the loss of environmentally sensitive areas and the precedent for similar construction in other such wetland areas including conformance to the comprehensive plan. For any other building or structure(s) there shall be a 50-foot minimum setback required from the edge of such designated wetlands.

(Ord. No. 2796-10, § 2, 2-22-10; Ord. No. 2843-11, § 3.c.F., 6-13-11; Memo of 2-22-12(Att. 3.c.F.)) 
Sec. 58-89. - Zoning changes and amendments, public notice requirements and procedures for zoning amendments and conditional uses. 
(a)  Applications for zoning changes and amendments. The regulations, restrictions, and district boundaries set out in this article may from time to time be amended, supplemented, changed or repealed. The procedure shall be as follows: 
(1)  A zoning text or map amendment may be proposed by the city commission or the planning and zoning commission. A zoning map amendment may be proposed by any individual, corporation, partnership or other entity having a bona-fide interest in such property either by ownership or by standing under a contract to purchase such land. All zoning text or map amendments must be made by ordinance. 
(2)  Applications shall be submitted on a standard application form accompanied by all pertinent information which may be required for proper consideration of the matter, along with payment of fees and charges as established by the city commission. 
(3)  Applicants shall include prospective plans indicating the desired development scenario proposed as a result of an approval per the plan submission requirements established for conditional uses. Applicants shall also indicate if the proposed development includes a request for community redevelopment area (CRA) funds, including the amount requested and the purpose of such funding. 
(b)  Standards for review of zoning amendments. All proposed zoning text or map amendments shall be submitted to the planning and zoning commission for study and recommendation. The commission shall study such proposals to determine: 
(1)  The need and justification for the change; 
(2)  When pertaining to the rezoning of land, the effect of the change, if any, on the particular property and the surrounding properties; 
(3)  When pertaining to the rezoning of land, the amount of undeveloped land in the general area and in the city having the same classification as that requested; 
(4)  That the proposed amendment is consistent with the applicable goals, policies, and text of the city's comprehensive plan, with appropriate consideration as to whether the proposed change will further, or at least not be contrary to, the purpose of this zoning ordinance and the general planning program; 
(5)  That the proposed plan resultant from the zoning change and proposed use as to business type, operating hours, noise, parking and traffic impact will be compatible with the existing and anticipated land use activities in the immediate neighborhood and that such use will be compatible with the character of the surrounding area; 
(6)  That adequate public facilities and services necessary to service the development associated with the proposed zoning will be available and in place at the time of impact of the development reliant upon such zoning; 
(7)  That the building size, floor area ratio, height and mass are compatible with and consistent with the scale and character of the immediate neighborhood; 
(8)  That the traffic generated from the proposed zoning shall not, on a daily or peak hour basis, degrade the level of service on adjacent roads or intersections or raise any traffic safety hazards; and 
(9)  That the proposed zoning does not create, through noise, intensity of activity, traffic, overflow paring, storm water runoff, etc., any conditions that degrade the value of adjacent properties, the peaceful use of adjacent properties, degrade the economy of adjacent businesses or degrade the character of the surrounding neighborhood or negatively impact the future use of adjacent properties. 
(c)  Requirements for public notification and hearings. 
(1)  Generally. No recommendation for amendment to this zoning ordinance shall be made by the planning and zoning commission until and unless a public hearing has been held. Before any public hearing is held by the planning and zoning commission under the provisions of this section for zoning map amendment or for review of any conditional use request, notice shall be provided based upon the type and size of the request as detailed below. In cases where requests are not specifically indicated in this section, the planning and community development director shall determine the most appropriate level of public notice. Regardless of the size of the project, when any proposed amendment to the official zoning map or conditional use involves a project that is requesting community redevelopment area (CRA) funds, then a statement to that effect specifying the amount requested and the purpose shall be included in the notice required for the project. 
(2)  Public notice requirements. 
a.  In addition to notice required by state law, for any proposed conditional uses involving drive-in business components, two-story buildings in the O-2 district of less than 10,000 gross square feet above grade, residential projects of three units or less, conditional use for restaurant or liquor licenses, new or used car sales, vehicle repair or service, parking lots or recreational facilities, said notice of the hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the city at least 15 days in advance of the hearing; written notice of the time and place of such meeting and the proposed action to be taken shall be posted upon the property and mailed to all owners of record of property within 500 feet of the property requested for rezoning at least 15 days prior to the public hearing. The public notice posted on the property shall be erected to be in full view of the general public on each street side of said land and shall be erected by the applicant. 
b.  In addition to notice required by state law, for any amendment to the official zoning map for land of less than one acre and for conditional uses involving church expansions, residential projects of four to 25 units, buildings over 10,000 gross square feet and less than 35,000 gross square feet above grade, day care, nursing homes and assisted living complexes said notice of the hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the city at least 15 days in advance of the hearing; written notice of the time and place of such meeting and the proposed action to be taken shall be posted upon the property and mailed to all owners of property of record within 1,500 feet of the property requested for rezoning at least 15 days prior to the public hearing. The public notice posted on the property shall be erected to be in full view of the general public on each street side of said land and shall be erected by the applicant. 
c.  In addition to notice required by state law, for any proposed amendment to the official zoning map for land of more than 80,000 square feet and for conditional uses involving residential projects with over 25 units, buildings over 35,000 gross square feet above grade and third-floor projects in the central business district, said notice of the hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the city at least 30 days in advance of the hearing; written notice of the time and place of such meeting and the proposed action to be taken shall be posted upon the property and mailed to all owners of record of property within 1,500 feet of the property, and mailed to all households as determined from the listing of utility billing addresses within the entire city limits at least 30 days prior to the public hearing. The public notice posted on the property shall be erected to be in full view of the general public on each street side of said land and shall be erected by the applicant. Said postings of properties shall remain in place through the public hearing process. The city shall monitor this posting and provide replacements for any postings lost due to weather, vandalism, etc. However, the absence of a posting due to these conditions beyond the control of the city or the applicant shall not constitute a breach of this requirement provided a good faith effort is made to comply. 
d.  Any public notice required after the initial advertised public hearing by the planning and zoning commission for a meeting of the planning commission due to tabling, continuance, postponement by the applicant or any other action by the planning commission shall revert to the 15-day notice requirements as specified in subsection (2)a. outlined above and the additional notice requirements of subsections (2)b. and c. shall not apply to these additional meetings of the planning and zoning commission unless staff is otherwise directed by the planning commission so as to allow for requests to be heard at the next regular or special meeting of the planning and zoning commission. 
e.  The initial public notice shall include the expected date, time and place of the public hearing for the expected first reading by the city commission of the ordinance for consideration to amend the official zoning map. If the date, time or place of the city commission first public hearing changes due to tabling, continuance, postponement by the applicant or other action by the planning and zoning commission, then the notice requirements for the city commission public hearings shall be as required for the adoption of ordinances by F.S. ch. 166. 
f.  Any proposed zoning text amendment proposed by the planning and zoning commission or city commission shall include notice as deemed appropriate by that commission given the nature and character of the amendment. 
(d)  Planning and zoning commission recommendation. The planning and zoning commission following their public hearing may recommend approval, approval with conditions, preliminary approval, denial or submit such request with no recommendation to the city commission in the case of a tie vote. However, if the planning and zoning commission makes no recommendation following two advertised public hearings from the date of the initial public notice, it shall be considered submitted to the city commission without recommendation on the proposed zoning text or map amendment. This provision shall not include any public hearing during which the applicant requests that the application be tabled, postponed or continued or any public hearing where the planning commission deems that the plans submitted do not meet the application submission requirements, notice is deemed insufficient or any other procedural deficiency. 
(e)  Reserved. 
(f)  Future applications. 
(1)  Whenever the city commission has, by amendment, changed the zoning classification of property, the planning and zoning commission shall not consider any petition for the rezoning of any part or all of the same property for a period of one year from the effective date of the amendatory ordinance. 
(2)  Whenever the planning and zoning commission has taken action to recommend the denial of a petition for the rezoning of property and that recommendation has been approved by the city commission, or when the planning and zoning commission has recommended granting a petition for the rezoning of property and the city commission has reversed that recommendation and denied the petition, the planning and zoning commission shall not: 
a.  Consider any further petition for the same rezoning of any part or all of the same property for a period of one year from date of such action by the city commission; 
b.  Consider a petition for any other kind of rezoning on any part or all of the same property of a period of one year from the date of such action by the city commission. 
(3)  The time limits of this subsection may be waived by the affirmative vote of four members of the city commission, when such action is deemed necessary to prevent injustice or to facilitate the proper development of the city. 
(g)  Commission decisions. The decision of the planning and zoning commission and the city commission may be made to affirm or deny the original request of the applicant or it may modify the request to approve a portion of the request or alternative version of the zoning text or map amendment. The planning and zoning commission may recommend and the city commission may impose conditions upon the approval of a zoning amendment. Such conditions may not restrict the range of permitted uses within a zoning district but such conditions may restrict or impose requirements upon the development or use of such land such as limitations on building size, height, setbacks or other site design or building design or use features. 
(h)  Continuances. Whenever the secretary to the planning and zoning commission has received a written request for a continuation, delay or postponement of a public hearing from an applicant after such public hearing has been duly advertised, the planning and zoning commission may grant the applicant's request. The commission shall reschedule the public hearing to any future scheduled meeting within the following six months; such rescheduling shall meet with the approval of the applicant. The applicant shall pay a second filing fee for rezoning to cover necessary administration and other expenses. If, after the second public hearing has been duly advertised and the applicant again requests a delay, postponement or continuation, or if the applicant does not agree with the rescheduling of the public hearing within the six-month period, the planning and zoning commission shall duly act to deny the request of the applicant, and a new request for rezoning of this property will not be accepted for a period of one year from the date of the second scheduled public hearing. 
(i)  Preliminary action. Preliminary action may be recommended by the planning and zoning commission and may be approved by the city commission. Preliminary action is the first step of a two-step approval process. A preliminary action for a zoning map amendment would constitute approval of the first reading of the zoning map amendment ordinance. The final approval requires the resubmission of additional plan documents or other relevant materials as may be deemed necessary to the planning and zoning commission and/or city commission. Following review and acceptance of the supplementary materials, the city commission may, at its discretion provide the final approval by the adoption of the zoning map amendment ordinance at its second reading. The city commission may request a subsequent review and recommendation by to the planning and zoning commission prior to consideration of the second reading of the zoning map amendment ordinance. Preliminary action does not establish a contractual obligation for the city to issue development orders and building permits until the final approval is granted. 
(j)  Development agreements. 
(1)  The approval of zoning map amendments may require the utilization of a development agreement. The development agreement incorporates the plan submissions, written application materials and verbal representations of the applicant as well as including any special conditions and restrictions. A development agreement may be approved by the city commission coincident with the initial final approval of the zoning map amendment or conditional use or may be executed at a later time. Unless specifically specified in the development agreement, development agreements utilized pursuant to zoning map amendments or conditional use approvals do not have to conform to the requirements of F.S. § 163.3221 et seq., or section 58-7 of the land development code. Development agreements shall be prepared by the City of Winter Park pursuant to the terms and conditions outlined by the planning and zoning commission and the city commission or development agreements may be prepared by the applicant subject to review and approval by the city attorney. Applicants shall be required to reimburse the city for actual city staff and city attorney expenses. 
Development agreements provided as part of the submissions for a final approval shall be reviewed by the planning commission. 
(2)  In cases where preliminary approvals are granted for amendments to the official zoning map, the effective date of such ordinance may be upon the date of execution of a development agreement following the subsequent review and approval by the city commission, following recommendation from the planning and zoning commission of the additional plan documents or other relevant materials as may be deemed necessary as exhibits for the development agreement. 
(k)  Plan submittals for commission review. 
(1)  Whenever an applicant submits plans as required by this Code, only the plans delivered to the planning commission members prior to the public hearing for their review as part of the official agenda packet together with a staff report analysis and other pertinent information shall be the basis for action by the planning and zoning commission. If those plans are substantially modified then such application shall be postponed and re-advertised for a subsequent meeting. 
(2)  Similarly, when the planning and zoning commission makes a recommendation on an application pursuant to specific plans, and those plans are significantly changed for submission to the city commission public hearing, then the significantly changed plans shall first be reviewed by the planning and zoning commission for recommendation before they are considered by the city commission for approval. 
(3)  The city commission shall not act on any application containing significantly changed plans but shall refer the significantly changed plans back to the planning and zoning commission, for subsequent review and recommendation unless such changes are in response to specific conditions of approval made by the planning and zoning commission. 
(4)  Whenever an applicant requests a work session or pre-application meeting before the planning and zoning commission or city commission or both combined commissions, such plans shall be submitted at least two weeks prior to such meeting and the planning staff shall prepare for review by such commissions, a preliminary report outlining the extent of the zoning variances and other issues that such application will entail. 
(l)  Significant changes to buildings or approved plans. 
(1)  Significant changes to buildings or approved plans are defined below. There are two times when plan documents are reviewed following a preliminary approval or following a final approval with respect to a determination of significant change. The first time is following a preliminary approval when plan documents are submitted for final approval as required by this Code. The second time is when plan documents are submitted for site development and building permits. In the first situation, the planning staff, based upon the criteria set forth below shall make a staff recommendation indicating the facts and conditions as they understand them to be. The planning and zoning commission shall then, following the required public hearing and based upon the criteria set forth below, make a recommendation either that: 
a.  No significant changes have been made; or 
b.  That significant changes have been made but those changes are acceptable to the planning and zoning commission; or 
c.  That significant changes have been made which are not acceptable to the planning and zoning commission in which case the developer must amend such plan documents and resubmit such plans for final approval in order to build the project in conformance with the parameters of the original preliminary approval. 
(2)  This action by the planning and zoning commission is a recommendation. The city commission shall then, following the required public hearing, make the final decision either that: 
a.  No significant changes have been made; or 
b.  That significant changes have been made but those changes are acceptable to the city commission; or 
c.  That significant changes have been made which are not acceptable to the city commission in which case the developer must amend such plan documents and resubmit such plans for final approval in order to build the project in conformance with the original parameters of the preliminary approval. 
(3)  In the second instance, the planning and development director must insure that the plan documents submitted for site development and building permits are consistent with the plan documents given final approval by the city commission. Any such determination of significant change by the planning and community development director in this instance may be appealed to the city commission following recommendation from the planning and zoning board. In order to determine whether a significant change shall be deemed to occur, the following criteria shall be used: 
a.  When there is an increase in the height of a building of more than one foot; or 
b.  When there is an increase in the square footage of a proposed building of more than 500 square feet above grade; or 
c.  When there is an increase in the impervious lot coverage of more than 1,000 square feet; or 
d.  When there is a change in the architectural style of the building; or 
e.  When there is a major shift or relocation of the site and floor plan(s) or the distribution of uses within the building or major shift or relocation in the features of building location, storm water retention, parking area and/or driveways; or 
f.  When additional variances are requested that have not previously been made part of the public record in the review by the planning and zoning board and/or the city commission; or 
g.  When the planning director or city commission believes a material change has been made in a plan detail that was critical to the consensus or decision made by the board or commission. 
(4)  The planning and zoning commission and the city commission will allow only the submission of one plan change to be reviewed under this section. For example, a project cannot increase the building height by one foot (which is not a significant change) and then request another determination for another additional foot increase in height and then another request and so on. 
(m)  Rezonings discouraged. In furtherance of the policies of the comprehensive plan, some types of re-zonings are discouraged in certain areas, as set forth in the future land use element policies. 
(Ord. No. 2388, §§ 1, 3, 10-10-00; Ord. No. 2632-05, § 1, 6-13-05; Ord. No. 2668-06, § 1, 5-8-06; Ord. No. 2796-10, § 2, 2-22-10; Ord. No. 2797-10, § 1, 4-22-10; Ord. No. 2849-11, § 14, 9-12-11; Ord. No. 2860-11, § 1, 11-14-11; Ord. No. 2910-13 , § 2, 2-11-13; Ord. No. 3096-17 , § 8, 12-11-17) 
Sec. 58-90. - Conditional uses. 
(a)  Applications for conditional uses. 
(1)  Within this article, various types of land uses, various types of structures, various types of businesses, certain types or sizes of buildings or certain types of licenses or business certificates have been deemed to require a conditional use approval prior to beginning operation or development. These conditional use approval requirements are to insure that such activities and projects are in conformance with the comprehensive plan policies and that they do not result in lack of compatibility and adverse effects with the type and size of buildings and the character of the surrounding area. Aside from the ability to deny such conditional uses or impose conditions upon such conditional use approvals in order to achieve these objectives, the city may also reduce the size, height and intensity of such buildings, structures and uses of land below that normally permitted within the zoning district in order to insure that these objectives are achieved. 
(2)  The planning and zoning board may recommend and the city commission may impose conditions upon the approval of a conditional use request. Conditional use applications encompass the entire site or property involved and do not relate only to the component of the plans requiring such conditional use approval. For residential development projects, (other than one single family home or duplex) the total square footage of the collective buildings shall be utilized to determine if a conditional use requirement applies but for the type of notice the size of the largest individual building shall be the determinant. Conditions may be imposed regarding the manner in which the entire conditional use property is developed and used and the city may impose restrictions otherwise not applicable by other typical land development codes as part of the conditional use approval. Such conditions may also include trial periods or time limits placed upon an approval. Such conditions may also be limited to the time period during which the applicant maintains the business certificate or occupational license for the business requesting such conditional use approval. Such conditions may also require infrastructure improvements for transportation, mobility, water, sewer, storm water and such. 
(b)  Requirements for public notice and hearings. The public notice requirements, procedures and regulations for the review of conditional uses by the planning and zoning commission and the city commission shall be the same as outlined for zoning changes and amendments, except as outlined below. 
(c)  Approval of conditional uses. 
(1)  A simple majority of the city commission may override any recommendation for denial or modify any conditions of approval in the recommendation of the planning and zoning board. 
(2)  In order to streamline the development plan approval process, the city commission in the approval of conditional uses may also grant limited exceptions from the terms of this article. Those exceptions shall be limited to the size, number and height of accessory structures such as walls, fences and signs and shall also be limited to site and building design features involving floor area ratio (but for floor area ratio, said exemption shall be limited exclusively to floor area ratio in a parking garage and further limited to no more than five percent of the total floor area ratio permitted by this article), the location or number of parking spaces, the location of storm water retention facilities, building setbacks, building lot coverage and building height, but for building height, said exception shall be limited to no more than five feet above the height limits of this article. 
(d)  Expiration and re-establishment of conditional uses. 
(1)  Conditional uses involving the use of land or buildings for a particular type of business or business activity determined to be a conditional use, such as, but not limited to, motor vehicle sales, live amplified musical entertainment, day care, alcoholic beverage licenses, etc., shall expire either one year from the date of the approval by the city commission if such use or business type has not yet been commenced or such conditional use shall expire 90 days from the time the business ceases to operate from the property or building. This shall apply if the business is closed for 90 consecutive days regardless of whether a business certificate continues to exist. Conditional uses involving approvals for the construction of buildings over 10,000 square feet or for three stories within the central business district geographical area shall expire after one year from the date of a preliminary approval by the city commission if a final development plan approval is not granted or such conditional uses shall expire after two years from the approval by the city commission from the date of the final development plan approval by the city commission unless a complete and sufficient building permit application and construction plans are submitted or construction is underway or as may otherwise be specifically set forth in the conditional use approval or in the accompanying development agreement. Pursuant to such submittal of building permit application and construction plans, construction must commence no later than six months from the date the building permit is issued. For phased projects without timetables specified in the conditional use approval or in the accompanying development agreement, all phases must be under construction within five years from the date construction commences on the first phase. 
(2)  The city commission may extend conditional uses or re-establish conditional use approvals that have expired at the discretion of the city commission. The advertisement and notification requirements shall not apply to the re-establishment of expired conditional uses except that for conditional uses approvals involving buildings over 10,000 square feet or involving three-story buildings within the central business district geographic area as defined in this code, the advertisement and notification requirements shall apply the same as for the initial approval of the conditional use in order for the city commission to extend or re-establish such conditional use approvals that have expired. For projects requiring citywide notice, the alternative use of a quarter-page display advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation shall substitute. However, for the re-establishment of any such conditional use requiring citywide notice that has been expired in excess of three years, the re-establishment of such conditional use shall require the citywide notice. 
(e)  Conditional use approval process. 
(1)  For conditional uses approvals involving buildings over 10,000 square feet or for three-story buildings within the central business district geographic area as defined in this code, there is a two-step process established involving a preliminary approval and then a final development plan approval. Preliminary approvals may be recommended by the planning and zoning board and may be approved by the city commission except for three-story buildings within the central business district and construction within stream floodplains which shall require two public hearing approvals of the preliminary conditional use by the city commission. Otherwise, at the discretion of the applicant, the applicant may apply and request a final development plan approval in one step by both the planning and zoning board and the city commission, if all relevant issues are addressed and complete submissions are approved. A preliminary approval is the first step of a two-step approval process. The second step is the final development plan approval which requires the resubmission of additional plan documents or other relevant materials as may be deemed necessary to the planning and zoning board for recommendation and for action by the city commission. The city commission may, except for three-story buildings within the central business district and for construction within stream floodplains, at its choosing, delegate the subsequent review and final development plan approval authority to the planning and zoning board such as providing for a final development plan approval subject to the planning and zoning board's review and approval of a landscape plan, lighting plan, etc. The initial preliminary approval does not establish a contractual obligation for the city to issue development orders and building permits until the final approval is granted. 
(2)  For conditional uses approvals not involving buildings over 10,000 square feet or not involving three-story buildings within the central business district geographic area as defined in this Code, the process combines the preliminary approval and a final development plan approval in one step. However, the city commission, at its choosing, may delegate the subsequent review and final approval authority to the planning and zoning commission such as providing for a final development plan approval subject to the planning and zoning commission's review and approval of a landscape plan, lighting plan, etc. 
(f)  Development agreements. 
(1)  The approval of conditional uses may require the utilization of a development agreement. The development agreement incorporates the plan submissions, written application materials and verbal representations of the applicant as well as including any special conditions and restrictions imposed by the city commission, upon which the approval may be based. A development agreement may be approved by the city commission coincident with the final approval of the conditional use or may be executed at a later time. Unless specified in the development agreement, development agreements utilized pursuant to conditional use approvals do not have to conform to the requirements of F.S. § 163.3221 et seq., or section 58-7 of the Land Development Code. Development agreements shall be prepared by the City of Winter Park pursuant to the terms and conditions outlined by the planning and zoning commission and the city commission or development agreements may be prepared by the applicant subject to review and approval by the city attorney. Applicants shall be required to reimburse the city for actual city staff and city attorney expenses. Development agreements provided as part of the submissions for a final approval shall be reviewed and approved by the planning commission. 
(2)  In cases where approvals are granted for conditional uses, the effective date of such conditional use approval may be upon the date of execution of a development agreement following the subsequent review and approval by the city commission, following recommendation from the planning and zoning commission of the additional plan documents or other relevant materials as may be deemed necessary as exhibits for the development agreement. 
(g)  Plan submittals for commission review. Whenever an applicant submits plans as required by this section, only the plans submitted to the planning commission members prior to the public hearing for their review, together with a staff report analysis and other pertinent information, shall be the basis for action by the planning and zoning commission. If those plans are substantially modified, then such application shall be postponed and re-advertised for a subsequent meeting. Similarly, when the planning and zoning commission makes a recommendation on an application pursuant to specific plans and those plans are substantially modified, then the modified plans shall first be reviewed by the planning and zoning commission before they are considered by the city commission for approval. The city commission shall not act on any application containing modified plans but shall refer the modified plans back to the planning and zoning commission for subsequent review and recommendation unless such changes are in response to specific conditions of approval made by the planning and zoning commission. 
(h)  Significant changes to buildings or approved plans. 
(1)  Significant changes to buildings or approved plans are defined below. There are two times when plan documents are reviewed following a preliminary approval or following a final development plan approval with respect to a determination of significant change. The first time is following a preliminary approval when plan documents are submitted for final development plan approval as required by this Code. The second time is when plan documents are submitted for site development and building permits. In the first situation, the planning staff, based upon the criteria set forth below, shall make a staff recommendation indicating the facts and conditions as they understand them to be. The planning and zoning commission shall then, following the required public hearing and based upon the criteria set forth below, make a recommendation either that: 
a.  No significant changes have been made; or 
b.  That significant changes have been made but those changes are acceptable to the planning and zoning commission; or 
c.  That significant changes have been made which are not acceptable to the planning and zoning commission in which case the developer must amend such plan documents and resubmit such plans for final approval in order to build the project in conformance with the parameters of the original preliminary approval. 
This action by the planning and zoning commission is a recommendation. The city commission shall then, following the required public hearing, make the final decision that either: 
1.  No significant changes have been made; or 
2.  That significant changes have been made but those changes are acceptable to the city commission; or 
3.  That significant changes have been made which are not acceptable to the city commission in which case the developer must amend such plan documents and resubmit such plans for final approval in order to build the project in conformance with the original parameters of the preliminary approval. In the second instance, the planning and development director must insure that the plan documents submitted for site development and building permits are consistent with the plan documents given final approval by the city commission. Any such determination of significant change by the planning and community development director in this instance may be appealed to the city commission following recommendation from the planning and zoning commission. In order to determine whether a significant change shall be deemed to occur, the following criteria shall be used: 
(i)  When there is an increase in the height of a building of more than one foot; or 
(ii)  When there is an increase in the square footage of a proposed building of more than 250 square feet above grade; or 
(iii)  When there is an increase in the impervious lot coverage of more than 500 square feet; or 
(iv)  When there is a change in the architectural style of the building; or 
(v)  When there is a major shift or relocation of the site and floor plan(s) or the distribution of uses within the building or major shift or relocation in the features of building location, stormwater retention, parking area and/or driveways; or 
(vi)  When additional variances are requested that have not previously been made part of the public record in the review by the planning and zoning commission and/or the city commission; or 
(vii)  When the planning director believes a material change has been made in a plan detail that was critical to the consensus or decision made by the board or commission. 
(2)  Decisions regarding significant changes may only occur one time. For example, a project cannot increase the building height by one foot (which is not a significant change) and then request another determination for another additional foot increase in height and another request and so on. 
(i)  Conditional use submittal requirements. 
(1)  For conditional use approvals involving buildings over 10,000 square feet or for three-story buildings within the central business district geographic area as defined in this Code, the applicant for approval of a conditional use shall submit to the city plans and all supplemental materials required to accompany such plans.

Additionally, all adjacent buildings and site improvements within 100 feet of the proposed site should be included within the digital 3-D images for review of the context with the immediately surrounding properties. 
h.  Exceptions. Any applicant may request that some of the required information described in the preceding subsections be omitted from the conditional use application, for good cause, contingent upon the approval of the planning director. 
(2)  For conditional use approvals not involving buildings over 10,000 square feet or not involving three-story buildings within the central business district geographic area as defined in this Code, the planning director shall determine the applicable submittal requirements from the list provided in the previous subsection. 
(j)  Standards for consideration of conditional use requests. The decision of the planning and zoning commission shall consider the following applicable standards as a basis for its recommendations to the city commission. Before any proposed conditional use may be approved or approved with conditions by the city commission, they shall conclude that the following applicable standards are satisfied. All actions to approve conditional uses by the planning and zoning commission and the city commission shall presume as a matter of fact that the following applicable standards have been met by the applicant regardless of whether they are specifically enumerated in writing or in discussion as part of the motion for approval. 
(1)  That the proposed plan is consistent with all applicable goals, objectives, policies and standards in the city comprehensive plan; 
(2)  That the proposed plan meets or exceeds all other applicable minimum standards and requirements as set forth in this section and this article; 
(3)  That the proposed site plan and proposed use, business type, operating hours, noise, parking and traffic impact will be compatible with existing and anticipated land use activities in the immediate neighborhood and that such application will be compatible with the character of the surrounding area; 
(4)  That adequate facilities and services necessary to service the development associated with the proposed site plan will be available and in place at the time of impact of the development or phase thereof; 
(5)  That the building size, floor area ratio, height and mass are compatible with the zoning code requirements and consistent with the scale and character of the immediate neighborhood. 
(6)  That the proposed site is properly landscaped and irrigated in and around buildings, along sidewalks, and buffering neighboring land. The topographical and natural features of the site shall be given priority consideration, thus assuring the retention of the trees. The developer, furthermore, shall make provisions for the continued maintenance of landscaped areas, open spaces, and recreational areas. Other screening and buffering may also be required when necessary to protect the integrity of the surrounding area; 
(7)  That traffic generated from the proposed uses shall not, on a daily or peak-hour basis, degrade the level of service on adjacent roads or intersections or raise any traffic safety hazards; that driveway and curb cut access directs traffic onto more heavily traveled roadways and away from residential neighborhoods; 
(8)  That the site plan provides onsite parking to meet the Code required and expected demands of the proposed use; 
(9)  That adequate provisions have been made for light, air, access, and privacy in the arrangement of buildings, one to another and to neighbors; 
(10)  That the architectural design and aesthetic features of the building plans are compatible with the surrounding area; 
(11)  That adequate light shall be provided in all parking areas and interior streets. This shall include the replacement of light poles with appropriate illumination appropriately spaced; 
(12)  That the proposed use does not create through noise, intensity of activity, traffic, overflow, parking, stormwater runoff, etc., any conditions that degrade the value of adjacent properties, the peaceful use of adjacent properties, degrade the economy of adjacent businesses or negatively impacts the existing character or future use of the surrounding neighborhood or adjacent properties. 
(k)  Additional standards and submittal requirements for conditional use requests. In addition to the general standards for conditional uses, certain conditional uses require other, more specific information and a determination that criteria and standards are achieved. These are as follows: 
(1)  Drive-in business. 
a.  The city, as an existing urbanized area, does not lend itself to the establishment of new transportation corridors or to the expansion of existing streets. As a result, the city must strive to maintain the most effective and efficient movement of traffic on the existing road network. Since the drive-in components of any business can increase traffic congestion, create safety hazards and adversely impact adjacent neighborhoods or existing streets when they are improperly designed or located, the city has determined that in order to protect the safety and convenience of its citizens, drive-in components of any business shall be conditional uses to be disapproved, approved or approved with conditions. In addition to the site plan and building plan submittals previously outlined, all applications for drive-ins shall contain the following information if required by the city planning staff: 
1.  Applicants shall submit a traffic data and impact analysis, including the average daily traffic on adjacent streets and the peak-hour(s) traffic on adjacent streets. This data shall also include daily and peak-hour traffic generation to and from the site, as well as the distribution of trips to the various entrances and exits. The peak-hour analysis shall be for the peak hour(s) of the business as well as the peak hours of the adjacent roadways. This data shall also include an analysis of internal traffic flow, including the nature and adequacy of stacking areas for average and peak periods. Relevant accident history data shall also be considered. 
2.  Applicants shall submit projections of the number of customers and the location of other similar businesses within this area of the city. 
b.  In order for the city to undertake its own analysis of these applications, all the above data shall be submitted no less than 30 days prior to the planning and zoning commission meeting date. This shall allow sufficient time to conduct traffic counts, turning movement studies, and to determine the adequacy of data submitted, as well as to question conclusions and findings by requesting supplementary information to back up previous submissions. 
c.  It is the intention of the city to permit drive-in businesses only when they impose no substantial adverse traffic impacts on adjacent streets and are consistent with existing character of the area. It is not the intention to permit drive-ins for a parcel which is not suited by location or configuration for such use. Thus, no permit shall be issued unless the city commission shall first determine that: 
1.  It is generally necessary or appropriate for the general welfare and public interest; 
2.  That the proposed use is consistent with the character of the surrounding neighborhood and that the property values are reasonably safeguarded; 
3.  That the size of the property is enough to accommodate the use during peak periods without substantial adverse effect on adjacent streets; 
4.  That no significant deterioration of traffic flow and/or turning movements will result on adjacent streets from this use; 
5.  That no undue traffic safety or traffic hazards will be created. 
(2)  Alcoholic beverages licenses and restaurant, bar, tavern, cocktail lounge conditional uses. The city has established that restaurants, bars, taverns, and cocktail lounges are conditional uses in commercial zoning districts close to residential properties due to the potential for negative off-site impacts that these establishments and their patrons may have on nearby residents. The enactment of this conditional use requirement has established that all existing and proposed establishments of this type are conditional uses. Renovations, changes in decor, floor plan, menu and changes to operating hours to any time before 11:00 p.m. are not deemed to be significant changes which require amendment of conditional use. Changes which result in the addition of the building area, seating or live amplified musical entertainment are deemed to be significant changes which require amendment/approval of a conditional use. In addition to the customary standards associated with condition uses, the following standards or criteria shall also be met in approving these conditional uses: The proposed use is compatible with the adjacent residential areas and will not create any nuisances related to overflow parking on residential streets, noise which is disturbing to the residential occupants, or loitering of patrons within residential areas. 
(3)  Alcoholic beverage-City class 3 (State 4COP) licenses. Commercial establishments which serve beer, wine and all other alcoholic beverages which require a city class 3 (State 4COP) liquor license may be permitted in the C-1, C-2 and C-3 and I-1 industrial zoning districts of the city. Establishments which desire a city class 3 (State 4COP) alcoholic beverage license for sales of all types of alcoholic beverages by the drink for consumption on the licensed premises, and which are located within 750 feet of any location for which a city class 3 (State 4COP) license has already been issued and is in force, or which are located within 1,000 feet of any established school or church, must first obtain a conditional use permit in accordance with this section. The distances required in this section shall be measured by following the shortest route of ordinary pedestrian travel along a public right-of-way from the proposed main entrance of the applicant to the main entrance of any church or class 3 vendor, and in the case of a school, to the nearest point of the school grounds in use as part of the school facilities. The city may as a condition of approval of a city class 3 liquor license require the establishment to also function as a restaurant with food service and established minimum levels of food service notwithstanding the absence of such requirements by the state alcoholic beverage license.

(b)  As used in this article, a variance is authorized only for height, area, size of structure, size of yards or landscaped open spaces, size of impervious surfaces and number of parking spaces. Establishment or expansion of a use otherwise prohibited shall not be allowed by variance, nor shall a variance be granted because of the presence of nonconformities in the zoning district or uses in an adjoining zoning district. 
(c)  A variance from the terms of this article shall not be granted by the board of adjustment unless and until: 
(1)  A written application for a variance is submitted demonstrating: 
a.  That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved and which are not applicable to other land, structures, or buildings in the same district; 
b.  That literal interpretation of the provisions of this article would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the terms of this article; 
c.  That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant; 
d.  That granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this article to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.

Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this article.

(g)  The concurring vote of four members of the board shall be necessary to effect any variation in the application of this article. 
(h)  Whenever the board of adjustment has granted a variance, it shall not consider any new application for a greater variance nor shall it reconsider any request for rehearing of an earlier application for a variance greater than that granted, except as provided for below. Whenever the board of adjustment has denied a variance request, it shall not reconsider that variance request nor shall it consider a request for any variance greater than or equal to that already denied, except as provided for below. The prohibition contained in this section against the board of adjustment's considering, reconsidering, or rehearing variance requests shall not apply: 
(1)  Where a period of three years has run since the date of the board's prior action on the variance request; or 
(2)  Where the relevant circumstances surrounding the variance request have materially changed since the board of adjustment's earlier decision. 
(i)  The right to reapply for a variance request after the passage of three years shall not prevent the board from applying the doctrine of administrative res judicata.

(d)  Banners, flags, project development signs, real estate signs, snipe signs, sandwich signs, a-frame portable signs and special event signs which are erected or used unlawfully such that they do not conform to the provisions of this article are subject to removal. The city commission finds that, in view of the inexpensive nature of these signs, and the administrative burden which would be imposed by the procedural prerequisites prior to removal, any procedure other than the summary removal of these signs when unlawfully erected and maintained would defeat the purpose of regulating such signs. Therefore, the city manager is hereby authorized to remove such signs when unlawfully erected and maintained. The city shall proceed by notifying either in person, by phone or by letter, the occupant and/or owner of the property, and if the sign identifies a party other than the occupant/owner of the property, the party is so identified. The notice shall advise that the sign is unlawful, and that the removal is required within 48 hours or the sign is subject to removal by the city. The notice shall advise that the sign, if removed by the city, may be retrieved within 30 days and that if the sign is not retrieved within that time, it will be disposed of by the city. Prior to the disposal of the sign, another notice shall be delivered concerning possible action. 
(e)  Signs and sign structures not subject to removal pursuant to subsection (d) above which are, or have been erected or maintained unlawfully, may be referred to the code enforcement board for appropriate action, or the city may proceed to pursue all remedies available at law or equity to it to remove signs or sign structures which are or have been unlawfully erected or maintained. 
(f)  All signs placed on city property or within street rights-of-way shall be subject to removal and disposal by the city.

(b)  The city commission shall be empowered to grant variances from the terms of this article and to permit signs otherwise prohibited by this article as deemed appropriate via agreements regarding nonconforming or prohibited signs on private properties as deemed necessary to fulfill the goals of the city, in improving the aesthetic appeal of the city, in reducing the number of outdoor advertising signs and in preserving and protecting historic or architecturally significant signs. 
(c)  The board of adjustment shall also be empowered to grant variances for signs subject to the limitations in this Code regarding the type and nature of variances permitted subject to the same provisions as specified in sections 58-88 and 58-89. 
(d)  The planning and zoning commission and the city commission shall be empowered to hear and decide appeals of decisions made by the building official in the enforcement or administration of this article as specified in section 58-91. 
(Ord. No. 2458-02, § 4, 3-12-02) 
Sec. 58-139. - Protection of first amendment rights. 
    Any sign, display, or device allowed under this article may contain, in lieu of any other copy, any otherwise lawful noncommercial message that does not direct attention to a business operated for profit or to a commodity or service for sale, and that complies with all other requirements of this article. 
(Ord. No. 2458-02, § 2, 3-12-02) 
Sec. 58-140. - Severability. 
(a)  Generally. If any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this section is declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect any other part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this section. 
(b)  Severability where less speech results. Without diminishing or limiting in any way the declaration of severability set forth elsewhere in this section, this Code, or any adopting ordinance, if any part, section subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this section is declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect any other part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this section, even if such severability would result in a situation where there would be less speech, whether by subjecting previously exempt signs to permitting or otherwise. 
(c)  Severability of provisions pertaining to prohibited signs. Without diminishing or limiting in any way the declaration of severability set forth elsewhere in this section, this Code, or any adopting ordinance, if any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this section or any other law is declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, the declaration of such unconstitutionality shall not affect any other part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word of this section that pertains to prohibited signs, including specifically those signs and sign-types prohibited and not allowed under section 58-135 of this section.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 3109-18 , § 2(Exh. A), adopted May 14, 2018, set out provisions intended for use as 58-137. Inasmuch as there are provision so designated, and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as 58-140. 
Secs. 58-141-58-160. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE V. - ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION REGULATIONS 
DIVISION 1. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 

Sec. 58-161. - Purpose and intent. 
    The city finds that the uncontrolled drainage of developed land has a significant adverse impact upon the health, safety and welfare of the city by increasing the siltation and pollution of ground and surface water, by accelerating the eutrophication of receiving waters, by diminishing groundwater recharge and by increasing the incidence and severity of flooding. In order to minimize these detrimental effects of stormwater runoff, the following stormwater management regulations are enacted to provide for the mitigation of stormwater impacts from new development and from the redevelopment of existing properties. 
Sec. 58-162. - Performance standards for new development. 
(a)  In order to achieve the benefits of stormwater management, the city shall require the provision of onsite stormwater retention for all new construction of buildings and parking lots. 
(b)  The stormwater management requirement for new development shall be the retention onsite of the first inch of runoff from all impervious surfaces. 
(c)  The stormwater retention requirements of this section shall be achieved through the retention of stormwater runoff in surface retention facilities, such as grassed swales or retention ponds. 
(d)  The above performance standards shall apply to all new nonresidential and multi-family residential building projects on vacant land, or land made vacant after the demolition of existing structures. These requirements shall also apply to all building projects whose construction value exceeds 50 percent of the assessed value of the improvements detailed on the most current property tax assessment role. Building renovations phased over a two-year period shall be combined to determine applicability of the 50-percent threshold criteria. 
Sec. 58-163. - Performance standards for the retrofit of existing development. 
(a)  In order to achieve the benefits of stormwater management on nonresidential and multi-family residential properties undergoing redevelopment, renovation or additions, the city shall require the provision of onsite stormwater retention. 
(b)  The following performance standards shall apply to all new nonresidential and multi-family residential building projects on vacant land, or land made vacant after the demolition of existing structures. These requirements shall also apply to all building projects whose construction value exceeds 50 percent of the assessed value of the improvements detailed on the most current property tax assessment role. Building renovations phased over a two-year period shall be combined to determine applicability of the 50 percent threshold criteria. 
(c)  The stormwater management requirement for new development shall be the retention onsite of the first inch of runoff from all impervious surfaces. 
(d)  The stormwater retention requirements of this section shall be achieved through the retention of stormwater runoff in surface retention facilities, such as grassed swales or retention ponds. 
(e)  The following stormwater performance standards for the retrofit of existing development shall apply to all building projects whose construction value exceeds 25 percent of the assessed value of the improvements detailed on the most current property tax assessment role. Building renovations or additions phased over a two-year period shall be combined to determine when the 25-percent threshold criteria has been achieved. 
(f)  The stormwater management requirement for the redevelopment, renovation or additions to existing buildings shall be the retention onsite of the first one-half inch of stormwater runoff from all impervious surfaces. 
(g)  The stormwater retention requirements of this section shall be accomplished by utilizing surface stormwater facilities. 
(h)  These stormwater management requirements for the retrofit of existing development do not allow properties constructed in conformance with the requirements for the first inch of retention to revert to a lesser requirement. 
Sec. 58-164. - Performance standards for properties within the central business district. 
(a)  In recognition of the existing developed density of properties within the central business district, special stormwater retention requirements are provided for the development or redevelopment of these properties. 
(b)  On properties within these districts the stormwater retention requirement shall be either: 
(1)  The provision of onsite stormwater retention of the first one-half inch from all impervious surfaces into surface or subsurface facilities; or 
(2)  The payment to the city of a fee in lieu of stormwater management to be equal to the cost of providing subsurface stormwater retention facilities. These fees are to be earmarked and utilized by the city for construction and improvement to capital facilities of the offsite stormwater management system within the city drainage basin. Such cost estimates shall be certified by a registered engineer. The stormwater board of appeals shall act to resolve any conflicts or disputes regarding the appropriate fee in lieu of stormwater management. 
Sec. 58-165. - Performance standards for properties within single family zoning districts. 
(a)  In recognition that single family properties have limitations on the percentage of impervious surfaces allowed, there are qualitative rather than quantitative stormwater retention requirements for these building projects. 
(b)  The stormwater management requirement for development and redevelopment on properties within single family districts shall include some method or methods of onsite retention for the building, parking, and driveway areas. These methods shall include, but not be limited to: the provision of swales or other retention areas; the sloping of parking areas and drives to landscaped areas versus directly to the street; the guttering of building runoff to landscaped open areas where setbacks limit the amount of pervious area available; and other such methods which provide opportunities for the percolation of stormwater. 
(c)  The above performance standards shall apply to all single family residential building projects on vacant land, or land made vacant after the demolition of existing structures. These requirements shall also apply to all building projects whose construction value exceeds 50 percent of the assessed value of the improvements detailed on the most current property tax assessment role. Building renovations phased over a two-year period shall be combined to determine applicability of the 50 percent threshold criteria. 
Sec. 58-166. - Stormwater management technical standards. 
(a)  It is the responsibility of the applicant to submit sufficient information for the building official and public works director or their designees to determine whether the requirements of this division are being met. The public works department may from time to time issue design guidelines that are to be followed in meeting the requirements of this division. 
(b)  Submittal information should detail elevations or contours, direction of flow, and other grading or fill information. Submittals should also detail the computations and calculations utilized to demonstrate satisfaction of the retention requirements. Submittals should also detail the type of soil conditions present and the depth to the water table. A soils report and/or survey may be required to verify the conditions represented on the plan. 
(c)  It shall be the duty of the property owner to provide proper maintenance of the stormwater management system so that the system continues to meet the requirements of this division. The city shall have the power to inspect stormwater management systems and facilities and to require such maintenance, repair, and replacement of facilities as necessary. Necessary maintenance and repair shall be made within a time period not to exceed 30 days after notification by the city of the problem and required corrective action. 
Sec. 58-167. - Surface stormwater system standards. 
(a)  Surface stormwater systems utilized to accomplish the stormwater retention and percolation requirements shall be designed so as to be readily accessible from rights-of-way, parking lots, court yards, or other open areas so that maintenance and clean-out of these areas can be easily accomplished. 
(b)  The side slopes and bottoms of all retention areas shall have a grass or other landscape material cover. The maximum depth of retention areas shall be four feet from the surrounding average grade. The maximum side slopes of retention areas shall not exceed three to one. 
(c)  Spillways or other entrance channels to retention areas shall be designed to prevent the flushing of these retention areas by heavy rains. 
(d)  Retention areas shall be designed and function such that all retained water is removed after the third day. If this is not accomplished by percolation and evaporation, the retention area must be improved to include an underdrain system or other bottom materials that will accomplish this requirement. 
(e)  The design shall not allow or permit the grade of the site to be elevated above two feet from the existing grade of the adjoining properties or adjoining right-of-ways. 
(Ord. No. 2737-08, § 1, 4-26-08) 
Sec. 58-168. - Underground stormwater system standards. 
(a)  Generally. Underground stormwater seepage systems may be permitted in all zoning districts upon city staff approval to accomplish stormwater retention and percolation requirements provided those systems are designed for the prevention of clogging by fine material and for ease of clean with convention sewer cleaning equipment.

Subdivision I. - In General 

Sec. 58-211. - General. 
(a)  Title. These regulations shall be known as the Floodplain Management Ordinance of Winter Park, hereinafter referred to as "this ordinance." 
(b)  Scope. The provisions of this ordinance shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including, but not limited to, the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; installation of swimming pools; accessory buildings and any other development regulated in flood hazard areas. 
(c)  Intent. The purposes of this ordinance and the flood load and flood-resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
(1)  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
(2)  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
(3)  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
(4)  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
(7)  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and 
(8)  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22. 
(d)  Coordination with the Florida Building Code. This ordinance is intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with the Florida Building Code. Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the edition of the standard that is referenced by the Florida Building Code. 
(e)  Warning. The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance and the Florida Building Code, as amended by this community, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This ordinance does not imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the flood insurance study and shown on flood insurance rate maps and the requirements of Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring this community to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with this ordinance. 
(f)  Disclaimer of liability. This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the Winter Park City Commission or by any officer or employee of the city thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. No. 3039-16 , § 2, 6-13-16) 
Sec. 58-212. - Applicability. 
(a)  General. Where there is a conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall be applicable. 
(b)  Areas to which this ordinance applies. This ordinance shall apply to all flood hazard areas within Winter Park, as established in subsection 58-212(c) of this ordinance. 
(c)  Basis for establishing flood hazard areas. The Flood Insurance Study for Orange County, Florida and Incorporated Areas, dated September 25, 2009 [Revised to reflect LOMR Effective: March 7, 2014] and all subsequent amendments and revisions, and the accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRM), and all subsequent amendments and revisions to such maps, are adopted by reference as a part of this article and shall serve as the minimum basis for establishing flood hazard areas. Studies and maps that establish flood hazard areas are on file at the building and permitting services department. 
(d)  Submission of additional data to establish flood hazard areas. To establish flood hazard areas and base flood elevations, pursuant to section 58-215 of this ordinance the floodplain administrator may require submission of additional data. Where field surveyed topography prepared by a Florida licensed professional surveyor or digital topography accepted by the community indicates that ground elevations: 
(1)  Are below the closest applicable base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard area on a FIRM, the area shall be considered as flood hazard area and subject to the requirements of this ordinance and, as applicable, the requirements of the Florida Building Code. 
(2)  Are above the closest applicable base flood elevation, the area shall be regulated as special flood hazard area unless the applicant obtains a letter of map change that removes the area from the special flood hazard area. 
(e)  Other laws. The provisions of this ordinance shall not be deemed to nullify any provisions of local, state or federal law. 
(f)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This ordinance supersedes any ordinance in effect for management of development in flood hazard areas. However, it is not intended to repeal or abrogate any existing ordinances, including, but not limited to, land development regulations, zoning ordinances, stormwater management regulations, or the Florida Building Code. In the event of a conflict between this ordinance and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall govern. This ordinance shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement, but any land that is subject to such interests shall also be governed by this ordinance. 
(g)  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this ordinance, all provisions shall be: 
(1)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
(2)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
(3)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.

    It is the intent of this division that the city will establish soil erosion and sedimentation control as an ongoing priority and shall establish soil erosion and sedimentation control fees for maintenance and repair of drainage structures and other city properties to be levied against certain owners, occupants, developers, contractors and subcontractors of real property within the city from whose property eroded soil and sediment have escaped and caused maintenance or repairs to be performed by the city on drainage structures or other city properties. 
Sec. 58-242. - Minimum requirements. 
(a)  General provisions. Soil erosion and sediment control measures taken shall conform to the requirements of this division. The application of such measures shall apply to all features of a landowner's property, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed by landowners, occupants, developers, contractors, and subcontractors to prevent soil erosion and sediment encroachments on city drainage structures, or into any lakes or watercourses. 
(b)  Requirements. All landowners, occupants, developers, contractors, and subcontractors shall follow sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent soil erosion and resulting sedimentation in any drainage structure, lake or watercourse consisting of the following requirements: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, grading, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to eliminate erosion. 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum. 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to eliminate erosion and sedimentation encroachment. 
(4)  Natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented whenever feasible. 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practical minimum. 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized. 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or other stabilization means shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development. 
(8)  Permanent vegetative erosion and sediment control measures as well as structural erosion and sedimentation control measure shall be installed prior to final inspection approval or issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment and runoff water from a drainage area must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the drainage area is stabilized. 
(10)  Adequate provision must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping surface of fills or to any grading. 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger or result in soil erosion onto adjoining property, lakes or watercourses. 
(12)  Fills shall not encroach upon lakes, natural watercourses or constructed channels. 
(13)  All land development activities shall include provision for control or treatment of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments onsite, or preclude eroded soil and sedimentation encroachment on drainage structures. 
Sec. 58-243. - Inspection and enforcement. 
(a)  The department shall periodically inspect the city's drainage structures and properties for evidence of eroded soil and sedimentation. If, through inspection, it is determined that any property has contributed eroded soil and sedimentation to drainage structures, lakes, watercourses or properties of the city or other properties, a written notice of this determination shall be served upon the landowner, occupant, developer, contractor or subcontractor of such property. The notice shall require the measures which the landowner, occupant, developer, contractor or subcontractor must take to remove soil and sediment from streets and sidewalks, and shall expressly prohibit such persons or entities from removing or attempting to remove soil and sediment from storm drains. Where construction, excavation, land filling or major land grading projects are in violation of this division, the building official is authorized to issue a "stop work" order to such projects until soil erosion is under control and all resulting damage has been remedied. 
(b)  The city manager or his designee shall have the power to conduct such investigations as may reasonably be deemed necessary in order to carry out the duties as prescribed in this division, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the site. 
(c)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the city who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials; nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in process of carrying out his official duties. 
Sec. 58-244. - Authority for soil erosion and sedimentation clean-up fees. 
    The department is empowered by this chapter to establish charges for the cost of maintenance, repair and cleanup to the city's drainage structures or other city properties resulting from eroded soil and sedimentation encroachment. Such charges shall be based on the cost incurred by the city in cleaning up the drainage structures or other city properties within the city and may vary in amount, depending upon particular circumstances, including inspection and administrative fees, and overhead costs. 
Sec. 58-245. - Fees, liens and penalties. 
(a)  Fees. Any landowner, occupant, developer, contractor or subcontractor of property from which eroded soil or sedimentation escapes and encroaches onto city drainage structures or other city properties shall pay a maintenance, repair or clean-up fee to be established by the department. The city shall have a lien against such property for costs of maintenance, repair, or clean-up, effective as of the date of the eroded soil or sedimentation encroachment onto any city drainage structure of other city properties. The landowner, occupant, developer, contractor or subcontractor shall pay the established fee within 30 days after receipt of a bill from the city in such an amount. The lien for nonpayment of the fee shall be superior to all other liens, except a lien for nonpayment of ad valorem taxes. Enforcement and foreclosure of such lien shall be as provided by law. The city shall be entitled to collect reasonable attorney's fees from any fee payer for services rendered by the city's attorney in collection of such charges, or in the institution of prosecution of any foreclosure proceedings. 
(b)  Penalties. Any landowner, occupant, developer, contractor or subcontractor of property violating shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the code enforcement board. Additionally, the city may withhold a certificate of occupancy or final inspection, or may ask the building official to intercede and issue a "stop work" order under the provisions of the city building code until such violation ceases and the provisions of this division are complied with.

(Ord. No. 2724-07, § 1, 10-8-07; Ord. No. 2895-12, § 1, 11-26-12) 
Sec. 58-285. - Criteria for issuance of tree removal permits. 
(a)  Each application for a tree removal permit shall be reviewed and a decision rendered on approval or denial (in whole or in part) on the basis of the following criteria: 
(1)  The health of the tree, i.e. whether the tree is deemed dead or beyond recovery, deteriorated or hazardous. 
(2)  The topography of the land and the effect of the tree removal upon erosion, soil retention and the diversion or increased flow of surface waters. 
(3)  The number, species, size, location and canopy of existing trees in the area and the effect the removal would have upon shade, sunlight, privacy, scenic beauty, wildlife, noise, air quality, wind, health, safety, prosperity, historic values and general welfare of the area and the as a whole. 
(4)  Whether structural improvements have been designed and located to minimize the removal of protected trees. 
(5)  The denial of the permit would create an unreasonable hardship on the property owner by severely limiting the use of the property in a manner not typically experienced by owners of similarly zoned and situated properties. A minor reduction of the potential number of residential units or building size due to the tree location does not represent a severe limit of the economic enjoyment of the property. 
(6)  The applicant has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city that there are no reasonable alternatives to preserve the tree(s). 
(7)  Such other criteria or factors as the city deems to be reasonable under the circumstances. 
(b)  No tree removal permit or other removal authorization as provided in this division may be issued for an historic tree without a written determination by the city that said tree is dead or beyond recovery, hazardous, or deteriorated. However, denial of a tree removal permit or removal authorization for a historic tree may still be appealed by the property owner(s) as provided in this division in subsection 58-286(d). 
(Ord. No. 2724-07, § 1, 10-8-07)

(2)  An accurate site plan drawn (hand-drawn site plan may be acceptable) to scale indicating which protected tree(s) are proposed to be removed, depicting the location, common or scientific names, and size. 
(3)  All protected trees petitioned for removal are to be marked on site in a harmless way and noted accordingly on the site plan. 
(4)  Application forms may also request information regarding reasons for tree removal and other specifics as determined by the city. 
(b)  When construction or demolition involving other permitting is involved. 
(1)  In addition to the requirements of subsection 58-286(a), applications arising out of new building construction, demolition permits or renovations requiring construction permits shall include an accurate site plan drawn to scale indicating the square footage of the site, the square footage of the proposed building area, the square footage of the existing tree canopy and the square footage of the tree canopy requested for removal. The site plan shall depict any proposed grade changes and a plan view of actual protected tree(s) and protected tree canopies on site including: 
a.  The property lines and footprint of existing structures; and 
b.  The existing and proposed grades; 
c.  Proposed additions to existing buildings, proposed new buildings, structures, and other impervious surfaces, such as but not limited to sidewalks, pool decks, driveways parking areas, storm water retention areas, overhead, and underground utilities, and other physical improvements.

If irrigation is provided, then each zone shall be irrigated with separate irrigation zones on separate programs. Refer to section 58-341, approved plant and tree materials, to determine the water needs of plants and to division 9, irrigation regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2766-09, § 1, 4-27-09) 
Sec. 58-333. - General criteria for all properties. 
(a)  The use of appropriate Florida-Friendly landscape design (http://www.floridayards.org/) is encouraged in order to reduce irrigation needs and to protect the waterfront. An irrigation system to be used during establishment and selectively during times of drought is still required for landscape plantings that feature Florida-friendly design. The nine principles are: 
(1)  Right plant, right place: Plants selected to suit a specific site will require minimal amounts of water, fertilizers, and pesticides. 
(2)  Water efficiently: Irrigate only when your lawn needs water. Efficient watering is the key to a healthy yard and conservation of limited resources. 
(3)  Fertilize appropriately: Less is often best. Over-use of fertilizers can be hazardous to your yard and the environment. 
(4)  Mulch: Maintain two to three inches of mulch to help retain soil moisture, prevent erosion and suppress weeds. 
(5)  Attract wildlife: Plants in your yard that provide food, water, and shelter can conserve Florida's diverse wildlife. 
(6)  Manage yard pests responsibly: Unwise use of pesticides can harm people, pets, beneficial organisms and the environment. 
(7)  Recycle: Grass clippings, leaves and yard trimmings composted and recycled on site provide nutrients to the soil and reduce waste disposal. 
(8)  Reduce stormwater runoff: Water running off your yard can carry pollutants, such as fertilizer, pesticides, soil, and debris that can harm water quality. Reduction of this runoff will help prevent pollution. 
(9)  Protect the waterfront: Waterfront property, whether on a river, stream or pond, is very fragile and should be carefully protected to maintain freshwater and marine ecosystems. 
(b)  All protected trees shall be provided with tree protection areas and barriers as required by Division 6, Tree Removal and Protection, Section 58-292. 
(c)  Mulch created from cypress trees is prohibited. 
(d)  The use of fertilizer with phosphorus shall conform to statutory requirements. 
(e)  Water-edge properties. 
(1)  The use of any fertilizer is prohibited within 20 feet of the ordinary high-water level or a seawall. 
(2)  Grading, construction or the clearing of any vegetation other than prohibited plants is prohibited within ten feet of the ordinary high-water level or a seawall. 
(3)  Stormwater retention is not allowed within ten feet of the ordinary high-water level or a seawall. 
(4)  Berms required to protect water bodies must be maintained as permitted. 
(5)  Natural wetland vegetation should be enhanced with additional plantings. The FDEP's book, Florida Wetland Plants: An Identification Manual, is an excellent reference source for information on plant materials. Copies of the identification manual can be purchased by contacting the Orange County extension office at 407-836-7570 or UF/IFAS Publications at 1-800-226-1764. 
(6)  Trees shall be required along shorelines as noted in section 58-335. 
(f)  Per State of Florida Statutes, call Sunshine State One (811, http://www.callsunshine.com) 72 hours prior to digging to have all utilities located. 
(g)  All automatic in-ground irrigation systems shall have a functioning rain sensor as required by Florida Statute. 
(h)  No person shall wash, sweep, or blow off fertilizers, vegetative material, and/or vegetative debris into stormwater drains, ditches, conveyances, water bodies, wetlands, or sidewalks or roadways. 
(i)  Deviations due to topography, building layout, or other special circumstances may be granted by the building official, the planning and zoning board, or the city commission on a case-by-case basis subject to meeting the intent of the landscape regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2766-09, § 1, 4-27-09; Ord. No. 2875-12, § 6, 6-11-12) 
Sec. 58-334. - General requirements for all properties involving new construction, renovation, or expansion. 
(a)  As a condition for the issuance of a building permit, all properties undergoing initial development or redevelopment involving construction, renovation, or expansion of the improvements on any property shall be required to conform to the landscape requirements in this division prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy if the value of the work is more than 50 percent of the value of the improvements on the property as set forth in the most recent records of the Orange County Property Appraiser. One- and two-family dwelling interior alterations shall not require compliance with ss 58-334 through 58-340. Existing commercial or multifamily properties undergoing redevelopment and containing nonconforming landscaped buffers and islands along street fronts and within the interior of parking lots may continue to utilize these same landscaped areas in lieu of the requirements in Subsection 58-336(e)(1) to prevent having a parking space deficit for the property. Where feasible, the requirements of Subsection 58-336(e)(1) will be met. Commercial and multifamily properties must meet these requirements as part of any expansion. 
(b)  Any tree installed to meet a requirement of this division shall be considered a protected tree as noted in division 6, tree removal and protection. 
(c)  Use of understory and shade trees. 
(1)  In some situations as noted within this division, understory trees may be substituted two for one (2:1) for required shade trees. 
(2)  Understory trees shall be used instead of shade trees under and within 15 feet of overhead power lines. 
(3)  When there are more than five shade trees required on a site, a minimum of two different tree species are required. When more than ten shade trees are required on a site, a minimum of three different tree species are required. 
(4)  Shade and understory tree trunks measured from the trunk centerline shall be a minimum distance of four feet from curbs, walks, pavement, walls, and underground utilities with the exclusion of city-owned public rights-of-way. 
(5)  Shade trees shall be spaced no closer than 25 feet. 
(d)  Prohibited plant species shall not count as an existing tree or plant to meet any part of this Code. 
(e)  All prohibited plant species shall be removed from each site prior to the beginning of construction. 
(f)  All landscape material shall be in conformance with the Standards for "Florida No. 1" or better as established in the latest Florida Grades and Standards Manual for Nursery Plants by State of Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Division of Plant Industries (http://www.doacs.state.fl.us/pi/pubs.html). 
(g)  All ground-mounted utilities except electrical transformers shall be painted green or flat black unless a different color is required by City or State of Florida Code. 
(h)  Air conditioning units, pool equipment, electrical equipment, utility boxes, generators, above-ground fuel tanks, and stored trash containers on private property shall not be easily visible from a public right-of-way. They shall be screened by structures, solid fences, trellises, and/or landscaping. Exceptions may be made for electrical equipment when determined appropriate by the city. Also refer to subsection 58-82(k)(2)b, (accessory structures). 
(i)  Deviations due to topography, building layout, or other special circumstances may be granted on a case-by-case basis subject to meeting the intent of the landscape regulations. 
(j)  For requirements for stormwater, see chapter 58, article V, division 1, stormwater management. 
(k)  Only bamboo species that grow to less than 20 feet in height shall be permitted beneath or within 5 feet of overhead electric utility lines. 
(Ord. No. 2766-09, § 1, 4-27-09) 
Sec. 58-335. - One- and two-family dwellings. 
(a)  Forty percent of pervious areas shall be low-water use zone(s) on separately programmed irrigation zone(s). See division 9, irrigation regulations, for specific requirements. 
(b)  A minimum of one shade tree shall be required for each quarter-acre (10,890 square feet) of property. For lots less than a quarter-acre in size, one shade tree is required, however, in situations where conditions exist which make it unfeasible to comply with the shade tree planting requirements, the city may make an exception and allow two understory trees in replacement for the one shade tree. Healthy existing shade trees shall count toward required shade trees. 
(c)  Shade trees shall be required in the parkway at the rate of one per 33 feet of lot width at the front lot line excluding paved areas and shall be placed in the parkway or adjacent private property with a minimum of one shade tree required per lot. Healthy existing shade trees count towards required shade trees. If overhead power lines or shade trees are present within 25 feet, then understory trees shall be substituted at a 2:1 ratio and may be required to be placed on the lot. If the parkway width is less than eight feet or contains a swale required by the city, the shade tree shall be placed on the lot or substituted with two understory trees in the parkway. Requiring the tree placement on private property, omission of a tree due to existing tree spacing or other modifications may be made at the direction of the city. 
(d)  Shade trees shall be required at the rate of one per 33 feet of shoreline within 25 feet of the shoreline with a minimum of one shade tree per lot. These newly planted shade trees may be clustered and healthy existing shade trees within 25 feet of the shoreline count towards required shade trees. Only one existing tree within each 33-foot length can be used for credit. Species of shade trees which are well-acclimated to the aquatic environment shall be given preference. Allowing the omission of a tree due to existing tree spacing or other modifications to this requirement may be made at the direction of the city. 
(Ord. No. 2766-09, § 1, 4-27-09) 
Sec. 58-336. - Nonresidential and multifamily properties. 
(a)  Landscape plans for all nonresidential and multifamily properties. Each set of plans filed with an application for a building permit for all nonresidential and multifamily development projects required to conform to this Code shall include a landscape plan complying with this division. This landscape plan shall be submitted to the building department and shall be approved by the parks director of the city or their designee, prior to the issuance of a building permit. Some projects, including, but not limited to, conditional use applications undergoing review by the planning and zoning commission or city commission will require submission of a landscape plan in advance of the application for the project's building permit. 
(1)  Landscape plans shall be prepared, signed, and sealed by a landscape architect currently licensed by the State of Florida. 
(2)  The landscape plan shall include: 
a.  Protected trees indicated by type and size and the proposed preservation or removal of these trees pursuant to the city's tree ordinance; 
b.  Plant material to be used listed with botanical names according to genus, species, variety, common name, size, spacing, and quantity; 
c.  Hardscape elements such as walls, patios, walks, and vehicle use areas and location of utility equipment;

(b)  General. 
(1)  Seventy percent of pervious areas shall be low-water use zone(s) with the allowance for watering container plantings anytime with low-volume irrigation on a separate irrigation zone on a separate controller program. Low-water use zones shall be on a separate irrigation zone(s). See division 9, irrigation regulations, for specific requirements. 
(2)  To decrease watering needs, high-water use zones less than 300 square feet or within an area with any one dimension less than ten feet shall be prohibited. 
(3)  Chain link fences are prohibited except in industrial and recreational areas where their use is limited to nonstreet frontage areas of a building and not adjacent to residential. See subsection 58-82(p) of the zoning article. 
(c)  Buffer between one- and two-family dwellings and public rights-of-way. 
(1)  A buffer of shade and understory trees shall be required where vehicle use areas do not adjoin one- and two-family dwellings and public rights-of-way. Two shade trees and three understory trees shall be required for each 100 linear feet of landscape area. 
(d)  Building facade landscaping. 
(1)  When building facades are visible from any public rights-of-way, one hundred percent of the total length of the visible facade(s), exclusive of those areas required for direct access to the building or special architectural features not intended to be screened by landscaping, shall have a landscape area. 
(2)  The landscape area shall contain plants and be a minimum width of six feet located within a 20-foot distance of the facade(s) or if adjacent to the building facade it shall be at least eight feet in width. 
(3)  At least 50 percent of the plants shall be a minimum height of twelve 12 inches at the time of planting and achieve a minimum of two feet in height. 
(4)  A minimum of five understory trees shall be required for each one hundred linear feet of the required landscape area. 
(5)  A minimum distance of 12 feet between any required shade tree trunk centerline and any exterior wall must be provided. 
(6)  Shade trees and landscaping within the public right-of-way shall be provided in areas where the street frontage building setback is 15 feet or less. The minimum planting area width for shade trees shall be seven feet. Understory trees may be substituted two for one (2:1) for required shade trees if the planting area width is less than seven feet. The minimum planting area width for understory trees shall be four feet. 
(e)  Vehicle use area landscaping. 
(1)  The vehicle use area shall be landscaped and screened from view. A landscape area a minimum of eight feet in width shall be required along public rights-of-way and shall consist of a hedge, one shade tree, and one understory tree for each 50 linear feet of the required landscaped area deducting paved areas. Other vehicle use area landscape areas shall be planted with ground cover or other appropriate landscape material. Reasonable breaks in landscaping in vehicular use areas shall be made to allow pedestrian access through parking areas to points of destination. Vehicle parking spaces directly abutting the landscaped buffer along public rights-of-way may count two feet of the eight-foot buffer toward meeting the required 18-foot parking space length and no additional bumper or curb stop shall be required in these spaces other than the curbing along the landscaped buffer. 
(2)  a.  All vehicle use areas that adjoin a residential property shall be effectively screened by a ten-foot wide buffer. This buffer shall contain a six-foot high masonry wall and footer immediately adjacent to the property line with grass, ground cover, or other appropriate landscape material. In addition, the buffer shall contain one shade tree and one understory tree for each 60 linear feet of landscape area. Adjacent existing trees may require the substitution of understory trees at a 2:1 ratio and/or the use of wall bridge footers to minimize damage to root systems. 
b.  Special landscape and wall buffer requirements for vehicle use areas across the street from residential areas. 
The development of parking lots or vehicle use areas on properties fronting on streets directly across from residential properties must be developed with a landscape buffer so as to be in harmony with the existing residential properties. In order to accomplish this, the following mandatory design criteria for this landscape buffer is required: 
A minimum ten-foot setback from the property line to such parking lot or vehicle use area must be provided from the street-front property line across the street from the residential properties, and a five-foot-high stucco masonry wall with a neutral color must be provided at this ten-foot setback with six-foot columns placed every 20 to 30 feet along the length of the wall. Staggering the wall to provide articulation at setbacks greater than ten feet is permitted. 
Within the required ten-foot setback, a landscape buffer shall be provided which shall consist of a minimum of seven-gallon plantings spaced every 30 inches of podocarpus, viburnum or Florida anise planting so as to create a hedge, along with a minimum of 65-gallon ligustrum, Japanese, blueberry or magnolia trees spaced every 30 feet apart among the hedge. In addition, the exterior landscape area shall have one-gallon groundcover spaced 18 inches apart of either Asian jasmine, ground mound lantana or yellow bulbine. As a future substitute for the hedges the exterior face of the wall may be planted with wandering fig in order to create a "green wall" within two years from the time of planting, with the hedging material planted simultaneously to provide a buffer until the vine has substantially covered the wall after which the hedging material may be removed. An in-ground irrigation system shall be provided in order to ensure that all planting materials will grow and thrive. 
Solid waste containers, trash containers, storage enclosures or any other structures shall not be constructed or placed in locations that are visible to the residential properties on the opposite side of the street. 
(3)  The vehicle use area shall contain interior landscape areas that account for a minimum of seven and one-half percent of the vehicle use area. Each separate landscape island or area shall be a minimum of 216 square feet in size with a 12-foot width (measured at backs of curbs) with an 18-foot depth and shall contain at least one shade tree in each island or area. All interior and perimeter landscaping shall be protected from vehicular encroachment by curbing and wheel stops. All vehicle use area base materials (lime rock, soil cement, etc.) shall not extend further than six inches from the back of curbs into the landscape areas. 
(4)  Landscape islands shall be required so that there are no more than a maximum of ten continuous parking spaces in a row unless a change in spacing allows preservation of healthy existing trees in the parking row. Landscape areas with one shade tree each shall be required at the end of each row of parking. 
(f)  Exceptions. Special circumstances may exist in landscape areas located under power lines or close to existing trees that will necessitate the use of understory trees at a two for one (2:1) ratio. In those circumstances, the city may accept other landscape materials that are appropriate for these special circumstances. 
(g)  Stormwater retention areas. Stormwater retention areas not screened from view from any public right-of-way by a building or wall shall be screened by a hedge maintained at a four-foot height installed in a landscape area a minimum of four feet in width. In addition, a cypress tree of at least four-inch diameter shall be planted within the stormwater retention area for each 50 linear feet of the stormwater retention area. 
(h)  Intersection and right-of-way visibility. When an accessway intersects a public right-of-way, landscaping may be used to define the intersection, provided that all landscaping within the triangular areas described in subsections (f)(1) and (2) below shall provide unobstructed cross-visibility at a level between two and one-half feet in height and eight feet in height. Trees and foliage shall be periodically pruned and trimmed so that no limbs or foliage extend into the cross-visibility zone. Landscaping, except for grass and similar low ground cover, shall not be located closer than three feet from the edge of any accessway. The triangular areas referenced above shall satisfy the following dimensional requirements, except to the extent deemed unnecessary by the city engineer. 
(1)  The areas of property on both sides of an accessway formed by the intersection of each side of the accessway and the public right-of-way line with two sides of each triangle being ten feet in length from the point of intersection and the third side being a line connecting the ends of the other sides; 
(2)  The area of property located at a corner formed by the intersection of two or more public rights-of-way with two sides of the triangular area being measured 30 feet in length along the abutting edges of pavement, from their point of intersection, and the third being a line connecting the ends of the other two lines; and 
(3)  Landscaping shall not block roadway signage. 
(i)  Service areas. Service areas visible from a public right-of-way or abutting property shall be screened by a solid wall and hedge maintained at a six-foot height in a minimum four-foot wide planting area clear of walls or their footers. A vine maintained at a six-foot height in a minimum two-foot wide planting area clear of walls or their footers may be substituted for a hedge. The wall shall be a minimum of six feet in height using architectural design, materials, and colors that are consistent with those of the primary structure. 
(j)  Solid waste storage areas. All solid waste refuse facilities shall be screened on three sides by a solid wall with opaque gates and a hedge maintained at a six-foot height in a minimum four-foot-wide planting area clear of wall footers. A vine maintained at a six-foot height in a minimum two-foot-wide planting area clear of wall footers may be substituted for a hedge. The wall shall be a minimum of six feet in height using architectural design, materials, and colors that are consistent with those of the primary structure. Smaller planting areas around the container or alternate methods to accomplish the goal of an attractive enclosure may be authorized in existing parking lots and new projects with limited space. 
(k)  Open storage area. An open storage area shall not be permitted unless it is totally screened from the public right-of-way and any adjacent properties by a solid wall and hedge maintained at a six-foot height in a minimum four-foot wide planting area clear of wall footers. A vine maintained at a six-foot height in a minimum two-foot wide planting area clear of walls or their footers may be substituted for a hedge. The wall shall be a minimum of six feet in height using architectural design, materials, and colors that are consistent with those of the primary structure. 
(l)  Merchandise display areas. A merchandise display area (e.g., garden centers), that is within 100 feet of a public right-of-way shall be fenced by decorative metal or solid vinyl privacy fencing. Additionally, the merchandise display area shall be landscaped, integrated into the design of the primary structure using landscaping adjacent to the perimeter, and utilize one of the following techniques: 
(1)  Masonry columns using architectural design, materials, and colors that are consistent with those of the primary structure, spaced a minimum of 25 feet apart; or 
(2)  A freestanding wall using architectural design, materials, and colors that are consistent with those of the primary structure along the entire length of the fenced merchandise display area that covers at least 50 percent of the fenced storage area. 
(m)  Drive-through windows and lanes. Landscaping of newly constructed drive-through windows and lanes adjacent to or visible from public rights-of-way shall include an eight-foot wide planting area of an appropriate length with a hedge maintained at a minimum height of six feet and one understory tree for each 15 feet of length. Renovation of a drive-through requires a four-foot planting area of an appropriate length with a hedge maintained at a minimum height of six feet and one understory tree for each 15 feet of length. If the drive-through is adjacent to residential, it will require an eight-foot planting area as described above in this same subsection. 
(n)  For parking requirements, see article III, zoning, chapter 58-81, off-street parking and loading regulations.

An exterior lighting plan, including a photometric plan (which covers the parcel which is the site of the building or project in question), appropriate pole, fixture, and lamp technical specifications, descriptions of lenses and optical systems and appropriate data tables shall be submitted for review. The exterior lighting plan shall be prepared by a professional engineer, landscape architect or professional architect registered in Florida who shall certify on the photometric plan that the exterior lighting plan complies with this article. The photometric plan shall be prepared in a scale that is easily legible. 
(2)  Lighting intensities. Lighting intensities for buildings, projects, or other uses not specifically regulated by this article (for example, athletic fields, courts, and swimming pools) shall be designed as recommended by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA). However, all such uses shall comply with these regulations for control of glare and light level at the property line, by using hoods, visors or similar shielding devices. 
(3)  Footcandle intensities. Footcandle intensities specified in this article shall be maintained values calculated using a maintenance factor ("m.f.") not lower than 1.0. 
(4)  Light fixtures; types. All light fixtures, including security lighting, shall be cutoff fixtures, and shall be incorporated as an integral design element that complements the design of the building or project through style, material or color. Luminaires shall not be titled. Lighting of or on buildings shall be limited to wall washer type fixtures or up-lights, which do not produce spill light or glare. A cutoff fixture shall not have more than one percent of lamp lumens above horizontal. Sag lenses, convex lenses, and drop lenses shall be prohibited. Lighting at a building or project shall not be comprised in whole or part of any floodlights, except floodlights may be permitted with a noncommercial industrial use, provided the floodlights are shielded to meet cut-off standards and. light levels at the property line. 
(5)  Illumination levels. Illumination levels at the interior (side or rear) property line of the building or project shall not be more than 0.5 f.c. at any point when the building or project is located next to any residential use, and shall not be more than 1.0 f.c. when located next to any other use. To avoid glare or spill light from encroaching onto adjacent properties, illumination shall be installed with house side shields and reflectors, and shall be maintained in such a manner as to confine light rays to the premises of the building or project. 
(6)  Time controls. Non-residential lighting shall be installed with time controls so that light levels are reduced not later than one hour after the close of operations to the minimum levels needed under the IESNA to ensure safety and security (approximately a 50 percent reduction). 
(7)  Upgrade or replacement. When 50 percent or more of any component (e.g., luminaires, poles) of the exterior lighting system at a building or project is upgraded, changed, or replaced (not including regular maintenance), such component for the remainder of the exterior lighting shall be brought into substantial compliance with the requirements of this article. 
(b)  Specific standards. 
(1)  Height. Except as otherwise required under this article, the height of an outdoor lighting fixture (inclusive of the pole and light source/luminaire) shall be a maximum of 16 feet. For large parking lots over one acre in area, a maximum pole and lighting fixture height of 30 feet shall be permitted. Height shall be measured from the finished grade to the top of the light fixture. The height of the fixture shall be in scale with the building; for example the fixture height shall not exceed the height of the building. Parking lots adjacent to or across the street from residential properties will be subject to lesser height requirements to prevent glare or light trespass onto those properties. Any additional fixture height increase or deviation for heights of fixtures will be considered on a case by case basis where it is shown not to be detrimental to the purpose and intent of this division. 
(2)  Parking areas. To avoid conflict in layout, parking area lighting shall be coordinated with the required parking area landscape plans. In a parking area, the following lighting requirements shall apply: 
a.  The lamp source shall be metal halide, or compact fluorescent, or a light source that produces a Color Rendering Index (CRI) of 65 or higher. Wattage shall not exceed 400 watts per bulb. 
b.  Illumination levels outside the radius of any light pole or the building mounted fixture (with radius meaning or equaling the height of the fixture, not to exceed 30 feet, but no less than 20 feet) shall range between a minimum of 0.6 f.c. and a maximum of 3.6 f.c. The 30-foot or lesser radius shall be shown on the photometric plan. Overflow lighting in a transition zone around a canopied area (see subsection (b)(4) regarding canopied areas) shall be permissible in the parking area surrounding the canopied area, notwithstanding the general lighting requirements in this subsection (b)(2) for parking areas. 
c.  Decorative acorn-type fixtures shall not exceed 16 feet in height and 175 watts per bulb, and shall have a textured clear lens/globe, frosted/ phosphor coated bulbs, and an internal louvered optical system. (Refractor type glass globes that meet the cutoff standard and are equipped with frosted/phosphor coated bulbs are acceptable.) Any additional fixture height increase will be considered on a case by case basis where it is shown not to be detrimental to the purpose and intent of this division. Acorn-type fixtures may be permitted in other locations on a case by case basis. 
(3)  Pedestrian walkways and bikeways. In pedestrian walkways or bikeways away from buildings the following lighting requirements shall apply: 
a.  The light fixture/luminaire shall match or complement the architecture of the building. 
b.  The lamp source shall be metal halide, or compact fluorescent, or a light source that produces a CRI of 65 or higher and shall not exceed 100 watts per bulb. 
c.  Illumination level shall not exceed a maximum of 2.5 f.c. 
(4)  Vehicular canopied areas. At a vehicular canopied area, such as that found at drive-through facilities at banks, service stations, convenience centers, and car-washes, lighting under the vehicular canopy, awning, porte-cochere, etcetera, shall be either recessed or cut-off fixtures. Additionally, the following lighting requirements shall apply: 
a.  The lamp source shall be either metal halide, with wattage not to exceed 250 watts per bulb, or compact fluorescent, or a light source that produces a CRI of 65 or higher; 
b.  The maximum footcandle level shall be 15 f.c. (average maintained maximum), 
(5)  Dealerships. 
a.  Display areas at dealerships for new and used vehicles, such as automobiles, trucks, recreational vehicles, motorcycles, and boats, shall have a maximum footcandle level of 15 f.c. for any row or tier of display that is adjacent to an external road or street (public or private), and a maximum level of ten f.c. for all other rows or tiers of display. However, overflow lighting in a transition zone around a row or tier of display that is adjacent to an external road or street shall be permissible between such row or tier and the adjoining row or tier. 
b.  Entrances and exits to and from the dealership shall not exceed ten f.c. when located away from the main display areas. 
c.  All other areas (parking and storage) shall comply with the applicable requirements of this division. 
d.  Existing dealerships may continue with current lighting levels; however, when undergoing redevelopment or remodeling as a new dealership lighting levels shall be reduced by at least ten percent in foot candle measurement. 
(6)  Fire lanes and driveways. Lighting at fire lanes or driveways at building entrances may exceed allowable standards of intensity for safety purposes upon demonstration that compliance with these lighting criteria would otherwise create a safety hazard. 
(7)  Automatic teller machines (ATMs). Lighting intensities at ATM machines shall be governed by applicable Florida Statutes. However, free standing ATMs shall not exceed 20 f.c. within a five-foot radius from the ATM or five f.c. within a 30-foot radius. 
(8)  Parking garages. Light for parking garages shall be designed to have no visible glare emitted from each intermediate story and shall incorporate low wall mount or similar fixtures on the exterior perimeter of the top level of the garage. Internal fixtures on the top level shall be installed no more than 12 feet above the floor surface and shall provide shielding to minimize visibility from neighboring properties. 
(9)  Adjustable fixture mounting systems. Adjustable fixture mounting systems are prohibited unless they are designed to comply with the provisions of this division at all adjustable positions of the fixture. 
(10)  Wall mounted fixtures. Wall mounted fixtures shall be a full cutoff type fixture. 
(11)  Backlit awnings on storefronts. Backlit awnings on storefronts or similar locations may be prohibited in areas subject to architectural design review such as the central business district, Morse Boulevard, and Winter Park Village.

Sec. 58-365. - Technical deviations. 
(a)  Any proposal which includes technical deviations from these lighting standards shall demonstrate the unique aesthetic and/or lighting design that meets or is within the spirit of these regulations. Such presentation shall include appropriate calculations and drawings or illustrations as necessary to explain the request or as may be required by the city. 
(b)  The building official shall make a determination whether to accept such proposed technical deviation. The cost of making such determination shall be borne by the party requesting the technical deviation. 
(c)  Alternate methods of lighting to accomplish green building standards or alternate decorative lighting such as gas lamps or lights shall be considered on a case by case basis but shall not violate the intent of this division. 
(Ord. No. 2734-08, § 1, 3-24-08) 
Sec. 58-366. - Letter of compliance required. 
    The building official shall not issue a certificate of occupancy until a licensed professional engineer or approved lighting professional delivers a letter of compliance stating that the exterior lighting at the building and site complies with this article.

(Ord. 2819-10, § 2, 8-23-10) 
Sec. 58-372. - Procedure for securing approval of subdivisions. 
(a)  General applicability. Any division of redivision of land, vacant or improved which creates two or more lots, parcels or other interests for the purpose of offer, sale, lease or development shall be deemed a subdivision within the city and shall be regulated by the provisions of this article. 
(b)  Pre-application procedure. It is recommended that persons considering subdividing land in the city arrange a conference with the city planner or zoning official and the city engineer before laying out any such plat. These city officials will instruct such persons in the preparation of any plat, particularly as regards the requirements of these regulations. 
(c)  Subdivision fees. The developer, subdivider or applicant shall pay at the time of submission of an application for a subdivision, or plans review, a nonrefundable fee established by the city commission as needed to cover the costs of reviewing, advertising and processing the application. 
Sec. 58-373. - Procedure for approval of preliminary plat. 
(a)  The subdivider shall submit 12 copies of the preliminary plat which has been prepared in compliance with the requirements of this article to the planning department. The preliminary plat, together with the subdivision application and any other materials required by these regulations, shall be submitted at least 30 days prior to the planning and zoning commission meeting. 
(b)  The city staff shall review all preliminary plats. Their comments and recommendations shall be presented to the planning and zoning commission. When the city staff finds the plat does not contain the detail of information required by these regulations, the subdivider shall be notified to submit a revised preliminary plat. Any additional advertising costs shall be borne by the applicant. 
(c)  The planning and zoning commission shall review the preliminary plat at a public hearing and make a recommendation for its approval, its approval subject to conditions, or its disapproval. In disapproving any preliminary plats, the planning and zoning commission shall provide reasons for such action, making references to specific sections in these regulations. 
(d)  The city commission preliminary plat review shall also be a public hearing with appropriate notice published in a newspaper of general circulation within the city at least 15 days in advance of the hearing. In addition, written notice of the time and place of such meeting and proposed action to be taken shall be mailed to all owners of record of property within 500 feet of the subdivision, at least ten days prior to the public hearing. 
(e)  Approval of a preliminary plat shall not constitute approval of the final subdivision plat. Rather, it shall be deemed an expression of approval to the layout submitted on a preliminary plat as a guide to the preparation of the final plat. 
Sec. 58-374. - Procedure for approval of final plat. 
(a)  The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plats as approved, and if desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary plat which he proposes to record and develop at the time; provided, however, that such portion conforms to all requirements of these regulations. 
(b)  Twelve copies of the final plat and other exhibits required for approval shall be prepared as specified in this article and shall be submitted to the planning and zoning commission within one year after approval of the preliminary plat; otherwise such approval shall become null and void unless an extension of time is applied for and granted by the planning and zoning commission. 
(c)  After the report and recommendation of the planning and zoning commission is made and filed, such plats shall be submitted to the city commission for its approval or disapproval. If disapproved by the city commission, the final plat shall be returned to the subdivider together with a statement setting forth the grounds for its disapproval. Should either the preliminary or final plat be disapproved by the planning and zoning commission, the subdivider may petition the city commission for its approval of the plat notwithstanding such disapproval by the planning and zoning commission, and the city commission shall either approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove such plat. 
Sec. 58-375. - Procedure for approval of plats (four or less lots). 
(a)  Application for approval of subdivision plats containing four or less divisions, parcels, lots, etc. shall be prepared by the subdivider. Plats and data shall combine those features required for both the preliminary and final plats. 
(b)  Application for approval shall be submitted in writing to the planning and zoning commission at least 30 days prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered. 
(c)  Twelve copies of the plat and other exhibits required for approval shall be prepared. 
(d)  Review by the planning and zoning commission shall be a public hearing. After report and recommendation of the planning and zoning commission is made, such plats shall be submitted to the city commission for its approval or disapproval as is required for all final plats. 
(e)  The city commission review shall be a public hearing with appropriate notice published in a newspaper of general circulation within the city at least 15 days in advance of the hearing. In addition, written notice of the time and place of such meeting and proposed action to be taken shall be mailed to all owners of record of property within 500 feet of the subdivision, at least ten days prior to the public hearing. 
(f)  The planning and zoning commission and/or the city commission may elect at a public hearing to require that plats, replats or resubdivisions of four or less lots conform to the procedures outlined for approval of preliminary plats and final plats. 
Sec. 58-376. - Variances and appeals from subdivision regulations. 
(a)  The city commission may grant a variance from the terms of these regulations when such variance will not be contrary to the public interest and where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship. Such variance shall not be granted if it has the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations nor shall any variance be granted to permit a private street. Furthermore, such variance shall not be granted by the city commission unless and until: 
(1)  A written application for a variance is submitted demonstrating: 
a.  That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structures or required subdivision improvements involved and which are not applicable to other lands, structures or required subdivision improvements; 
b.  That a literal interpretation of the provisions of these regulations would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties with similar conditions; 
c.  That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant; 
d.  That the granting of the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by these regulations to other lands, structures, or required subdivision improvements under similar conditions. No pre-existing conditions on neighboring lands which are contrary to these regulations shall be considered grounds for issuance of a variance. 
(2)  The city commission shall make findings that the requirements of this division have been met. 
(b)  A public hearing on the proposed variance shall be held. The public hearing may be held prior to or simultaneously with the public hearing for approval of the preliminary plat. Notice of the hearing and notification of adjacent property owners shall follow the same requirements outlined for the approval of preliminary plats. 
(c)  The city commission shall further make a finding that the reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance that would make possible the reasonable use of the land, buildings, or other improvements. 
(d)  The city commission shall make further finding that the granting of the variance would be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of these regulations, will not be injurious to the surrounding territory, or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 
(e)  In granting any variance, the city commission may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with these regulations. Violation of such conditions and safeguards when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted shall be deemed a violation of these regulations. 
(f)  Appeals. Any person aggrieved by the city commission's decision regarding a preliminary or final subdivision plan or plat, or the city commission's decision regarding any variance, may file a petition for a writ of certiorari in the Circuit Court of Orange County. 
Sec. 58-377. - Conformance to the comprehensive plan. 
(a)  In the City of Winter Park, as a substantially developed community, the review of lot splits, lot consolidations, plats, replats or subdivisions within developed areas of the city shall insure conformance with the adopted policies of the comprehensive plan as a precedent to the conformance with other technical standards or code requirements. 
(b)  In existing developed areas and neighborhoods, all proposed lots shall conform to the existing area of neighborhood density and layout. The proposed lot sizes, widths, depths, shape, access arrangement, buildable areas and orientation shall conform to the neighborhood standards and existing conditions. This provision is specifically intended to allow the denial or revision by the city of proposed lot splits, lot consolidations, plats, replats or subdivisions when those are not in conformance with the existing neighborhood density or standards, even if the proposed lots meet the minimum technical requirements of the zoning regulations. 
(c)  In determining the existing area or neighborhood density and standards, for the consideration of lot splits, plats, replats or subdivision of other than estate lots or lakefront lots, the planning and zoning commission and city commission shall consider the frontage and square foot area of home sites and vacant properties with comparable zoning within an area of 500-foot radius from the proposed subdivision. 
(d)  In order to implement the policies of the comprehensive plan, the city commission may also impose restrictions on the size, scale, and style of proposed building, structures, or other improvements. This provision shall enable the city commission to impose restrictions on the size, height, setback, lot coverage, impervious area or right-of-way access such that proposed building and other improvements match the dimension and character of the surrounding area or neighborhood. 
(e)  Pursuant to the policies of the comprehensive plan, in the consideration of lot splits, lot consolidations, plats, replats or subdivisions of single-family estate properties, it shall be recognized that, historically, Winter Park is a distinct residential community in part because of the existence of large estate lots. These existing estate lots, many with historical or architectural significance, provide a character that in turn creates value throughout the surrounding neighborhoods and the community. Thus, preservation of the estate lots maintains the attractive character of Winter Park that helps to set it apart from other cities in Florida. The existence of large estate lots dispersed throughout Winter Park adds great attractiveness, appeal and value to residents and potential buyers as contrasted with newer more uniform homogenous subdivisions. In order to protect these features and values and preserve neighborhood character, the city shall strongly discourage any subdivisions or lot splits of estate lots within areas designated single-family residential. 
(f)  Pursuant to the policies of the comprehensive plan, in the consideration of lot splits, plats, replats or subdivisions of lakefront estate lots, it is the city's policy to maintain the diversity of sizes of lakefront properties and lakefront estate lots and to strongly discourage the subdivision or split of such properties. The city shall preserve low densities along the city's lakefront property, including larger lakefront estate lots in order to perpetuate the unique character of Winter Park that sets it apart from other cities throughout Florida.

Sec. 58-381. - Certification of improvements. 
(a)  Prior to any actual work by the developer or his contractor, the city shall be furnished an estimate of the cost of the project. This may either be a professional engineer's estimate or the low bid received for the project. 
(b)  Construction of improvements by the developer shall be guaranteed by one of the following. Selection is at the option of the developer, but must be approved by the public works department. 
(1)  A performance bond executed by an approved corporate surety company in the amount of 100 percent for all required improvements to be owned and maintained by the city; 
(2)  An escrow agreement with the city for all required improvements to be owned and maintained by the city. 
(c)  All improvements to be owned and maintained by the city must be completed within a two-year period, or within a time period specified by the city commission. Time period to begin with the final approval of plat. 
(d)  The construction of sidewalks may be held in abeyance until such time as individual residences within the subdivision are constructed.

A performance bond or escrow account shall be initiated after formal acceptance by the city of all other improvements. 
(e)  A performance bond or escrow account shall also be initiated to insure against defects in materials and workmanship for all improvements owned and operated by the city for a one-year period after formal acceptance of the subdivision. 
(f)  The city commission shall formally accept the subdivision at such time as all improvements have been installed by the developer in accordance with these subdivision regulations. This acceptance shall terminate the performance bond or escrow account; however, this action shall in no way be construed to relieve the developer of the necessary one-year maintenance and warranty provision for the improvements nor the bond or escrow obligation toward completion of the sidewalks. 
(g)  The city shall not issue any building permits for structures within the subdivision until such time as all the required improvements have been installed, inspected and accepted by the city commission. The city shall issue building permits for structures in the subdivision upon acceptance by the city commission of a schedule for the installation and acceptance of the requirement improvements. However, failure by the developer to meet this accepted schedule will enable the city to withhold any additional building permits until such time as the required improvements are installed and accepted. 
(h)  The developer shall also pay to the city the actual cost of inspection services furnished by the city.

Sec. 58-388. - Stormwater management system. 
(a)  Performance standards. All development must be designed, constructed and maintained to meet the following performance standards: 
(1)  The stormwater management requirement for new development shall be the off-line retention of the first inch of runoff from all impervious surfaces or the quantity required by the applicable standards of the St. Johns River Water Management District, whichever is greater. 
(2)  The stormwater retention requirements of this section shall be achieved through the retention of stormwater runoff in surface retention facilities, such as grassed swales or retention ponds. 
(3)  Detention volume shall be provided so that the post-development peak rate of discharge shall not exceed the pre-development peak rate of discharge for the 25-year/24-hour design storm event, with a rainfall depth of eight and six-tenth inches. 
(4)  While development activity is underway and after it is completed, the characteristics of stormwater runoff shall approximate the rate, volume, quality, and timing of stormwater runoff that occurred under the site's natural unimproved or existing state. 
(5)  The proposed development activity shall not violate the water quality standards as set forth in Chapter 17-3, Florida Administrative Code. 
(b)  Design standards. To comply with the foregoing performance standards, the proposed stormwater management system shall conform to the following design standards: 
(1)  The side slopes and bottoms of all retention areas shall have a grass or other landscape material cover. The maximum side slopes of retention areas shall not exceed three to one. 
(2)  Spillways or other entrance channels to retention areas shall be designed to prevent the flushing of these retention areas by heavy rains. 
(3)  Retention areas shall be designed and function such that all retained water is removed after the third day. If this is not accomplished by percolation and evaporation, the retention area must be improved to include an underdrain system or other bottom materials that will accomplish this requirement. 
(4)  The proposed stormwater management system shall be designed to accommodate the stormwater that originates within the development and stormwater that flows onto or across the development from adjacent lands. 
(5)  The proposed stormwater management system shall be designed to function properly for a minimum 20-year life. 
(6)  The design and construction of the proposed stormwater management system shall be certified as meeting the requirements of this division by a professional engineer registered in the state. 
(7)  No surface water may be channelled or directed into a sanitary sewer. 
(8)  Dredging, clearing of vegetation, deepening, widening, straightening, stabilizing or otherwise altering natural surface waters shall be minimized. 
(9)  Natural surface water shall not be used as sediment traps during or after development. 
(10)  For aesthetic reasons and to increase shoreline habitat, the shorelines of detention and retention areas shall be sinuous rather than straight. 
(11)  Water reuse and conservation shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be achieved by incorporating the stormwater management system into irrigation systems serving the development. 
(12)  Vegetated buffers of sufficient width to prevent erosion shall be retained or created along the shores, banks or edges of all natural or man-made surface waters. 
(13)  In phased developments the stormwater management system for each integrated stage of completion shall be capable of functioning independently as required by this chapter. 
(14)  All detention and retention basins shall be accessible for maintenance from streets or public rights-of-way. 
(15)  Inlets shall be spaced in such a manner as to accept 100 percent of the design runoff. Typically, the maximum allowable gutter run will be 600 feet. However, the actual required spacing will depend on the characteristics of each particular site. Manholes shall be required at the end of each line; at all changes in grade, size and alignment. 
(16)  Specifications shall include a section outlining the proposed method of controlling soil erosion during construction. 
(17)  All drainage plans shall be subject to approval by the city engineer. Plan submission shall include clear engineering calculations showing the method of design, including soil information as required by the city engineer and existing as well as proposed topography. 
(c)  Relationship to other stormwater management requirements. In addition to meeting the requirements of this division, the design and performance of all stormwater management systems shall comply with applicable state regulations (Chapter 17-25, Florida Administrative Code) and rules of the St. Johns Water Management District. In all cases the strictest of the applicable standards shall apply. 
(d)  Ownership and maintenance of stormwater management systems. 
(1)  Dedication. The city shall determine whether, at its discretion, the stormwater management system approved under this chapter will function as an integral part of the city maintained system, as determined by the city/stormwater engineer, and in that case the facilities should be dedicated to the city, or whether the stormwater management system approved under this chapter will primarily serve the proposed development, and in that case the facilities will be maintained by a private property owners association as described below. 
(2)  Maintenance by an acceptable entity. All stormwater management systems that are not dedicated to the city shall be operated and maintained by for-profit or nonprofit corporations including homeowners associations, property owners associations, condominium owners associations or master associations and they must comply with the following requirements: 
a.  The owner or developer submits documents constituting legal capacity and a binding legal obligation between the entity and the city affirmatively taking responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the stormwater management facility. 
b.  The association has sufficient powers reflected in its organizational or operational documents to: 
1.  Operate and maintain the stormwater management system as permitted by the city; 
2.  Establish rules and regulations; 
3.  Assess members; 
4.  Contract for services; 
5.  Exist perpetually, with the articles of incorporation providing that if the association is dissolved, the stormwater management system will be maintained by an acceptable entity as described above. 
(3)  If a project is to be constructed in phases, and subsequent phases will use the same stormwater management facilities as the initial phase or phases, the operation/maintenance entity shall have the ability to accept responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the stormwater management systems of future phases of the project. 
(4)  The applicant shall be an acceptable entity and shall be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the stormwater management system from the time construction begins until the stormwater management system is dedicated to and accepted by another acceptable entity. 
(5)  A dedication to the city may or may not be desirable depending upon the particular circumstances. The foregoing provisions permit the decision to go either way while ensuring that the stormwater management system will be operated and maintained by a responsible entity. Much of the foregoing language is based on Chapter 17-25 of the department of environmental regulation's stormwater rule.

(1)  The new consolidated lot's dimensions are 150 percent greater than certain dimensional standards for that area, as described below: 
a.  For a property on a block composed of properties where the average lot frontage is greater than 60 feet, approval is required where the new lot's frontage or area will be 150 percent greater than the minimum lot frontage or area requirements for that zoning district. For example, for a property zoned R-1A, the 150 percent threshold shall be met if the new lot exceeds by 150 percent the R-1A minimum 75-foot lot width or the minimum 8,500 square foot area. 
b.  For a property on a block composed of properties where the average lot frontage is less than or equal to 60 feet, approval is required where the new lot's frontage or area will be 150 percent greater than the average frontage or area on that block; or 
(2)  The new lot will be 150 percent greater than the existing lot through the aggregation of lot(s) (or portions thereof) which: (1) are located behind the subject property, and (2) front on another street. 
(b)  Exceptions. Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection 58-392(a) above, a lot consolidation approval by the city commission shall not be required for the following: 
(1)  The new lot adds 25 feet or less of width. However, this exception shall not apply to new lots which add lot depth. 
(2)  The property owner voluntarily executes a binding deed restriction to run with title to the entire parcel which limits and restricts the maximum allowable floor area ratio to the total square footage that would have been permitted prior to the consolidation. Said deed restriction shall prohibit the removal of the deed restriction without the express approval of the city commission. Any subsequent request for removal of the deed restriction shall comply with the process and procedures for lot consolidation as outlined in this section. 
(c)  The following shall be considered in the review of residential lot consolidations: 
(1)  The proposal will not adversely affect access, design or other public safety concerns relevant to the original approval of plats, if any; 
(2)  The proposal will not violate any plat conditions; 
(3)  The proposal will not violate this Code; 
(4)  The proposal will not invalidate any easements; 
(5)  No new streets will be created; and 
(6)  The proposal will not be out of scale with the existing street or with the neighborhood character. 
(d)  In their consideration of lot consolidation requests, the city commission may limit the applicable floor area ratio, require greater setbacks or impose other restrictions as a condition of approval in order to preserve neighborhood scale and character. 
(e)  The public notice, process and procedure for the review of lot consolidation requests shall be the same as for the review of subdivision plats in sections 58-373-58-376.

For purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower or antenna complies with district development regulations, including but not limited to, setback requirements, lot-coverage requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire lot shall control, even though the antenna or tower may be located on leased parcels within such lot. 
(c)  Inventory of existing sites. Each applicant for an antenna and/or tower shall provide to the city an inventory of its existing towers, antennas, or sites approved for towers or antennas, that are either within the jurisdiction of the city or within one mile of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height and design of each tower. The city building official may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or conditional use permits under this article or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the city, provided, however, that the city building official is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. 
(d)  Aesthetics. Towers and antennas shall meet the following requirements: 
(1)  Towers not requiring FAA painting/marking shall have either a galvanized finish or painted a noncontrasting blue, gray, or black finish. 
(2)  At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that will blend them into the natural setting and surrounding buildings. 
(3)  If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. 
(4)  Alternative tower structures and towers and antennas that are otherwise concealed are preferred, and the city may require that a proposed tower or antenna be in the form of an alternative tower structure or otherwise concealed where appropriate to preserve the aesthetic character of the surrounding area. 
(e)  Lighting. Towers shall not be artificially lighted, except to assure human safety or as required by the FAA or other applicable authority. If lighting is required, the lighting alternatives and design chosen must cause the least disturbance to the surrounding views. At the time of construction of the tower in cases where there are residential uses located within a distance which is 300 percent of the height of the tower from the tower, dual mode lighting shall be requested from the FAA. 
(f)  State or federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC, and any other agency of the state or federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this article shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a different compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling state or federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. 
(g)  Building codes; safety standard. To ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable state or local building codes. If, upon inspection, the city concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days (or such shorter time as may be reasonably required by the city in an emergency situation) to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such tower into compliance within the required time period shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. Further, any improvements and/or additions (i.e., antenna, satellite dishes, etc.) to existing towers shall require submission of site plans sealed and verified by a professional engineer which demonstrate compliance with the applicable standards in effect at the time of such improvement or addition. Such plans shall be submitted to and reviewed and approved by the city building official at the time building permits are requested. 
(h)  Measurement. For purposes of measurement, tower setbacks as listed in subsection 58-427(c)(4) and separation distances as listed in subsection 58-427(c)(5) shall be calculated and applied to facilities located in the city irrespective of municipal and county jurisdictional boundaries. 
(i)  Not essential services. Towers and antennas shall be regulated and permitted pursuant to this article and shall not be regulated or permitted as essential services, public utilities, or private utilities. 
(j)  Franchises. Owners and/or operators of towers or antennas shall certify that all franchises, licenses, and approvals required by law for the construction and/or operation of a wireless communication system in the city have been obtained and shall file a copy of all required franchises, licenses and approvals with the city building official. 
(k)  Public notice. For purposes of this article, any conditional use request or appeal of an administratively-approved use or conditional use shall require public notice to all abutting property owners and all property owners of properties that are located within 500 feet of the perimeter of the parent parcel upon which the proposed tower is located in addition to any notice otherwise required by law. 
(l)  Signs. No signs, other than those required by law or those necessary to insure public safety, shall be allowed on an antenna or tower. 
(m)  Buildings and support equipment. Buildings and support equipment associated with antennas or towers shall comply with the requirements of section 58-428. 
(n)  Multiple antenna/tower plan. The city encourages the users of towers and antennas to submit a single application for approval of multiple towers and/or antenna sites. 
(o)  Height limit. In no event may a tower exceed 180 feet in height (including the height of a structure on which the tower is placed). 
(p)  Completeness review; time limitation . The city shall grant or deny a properly completed application for a tower, antenna, or other communications facility within 90 days or, as required by federal and state law, after the date the application is determined to be properly completed. An application is deemed submitted or resubmitted on the date the application is received by the city. The city shall notify the applicant within 20 days after the date the application is initially submitted or additional information resubmitted, whether the application is properly completed in compliance with the city's requirements. If the application is not completed in compliance with the city's requirements, the city shall so notify the applicant in writing indicating with specificity any deficiencies which, if cured, make the application properly completed. Upon resubmission of information to cure the stated deficiencies, the city shall notify the applicant, in writing, no later than 20 days after the additional information is submitted, of any remaining deficiencies that must be cured. If a specified deficiency is not properly cured when the applicant resubmits its application to comply with the notice of deficiencies, the city may continue to request the information until such time as the specified deficiency is cured, or may establish a reasonable time frame within which the required information to cure the application deficiency is to be provided. If the curative information is not provided within such time frame, the application will be considered withdrawn or closed.

Sec. 58-425. - Permitted uses. 
(a)  Generally. The uses listed in this section are deemed to be permitted uses and shall not require administrative approval or a conditional use permit. 
(b)  Permitted uses. The following uses are specifically permitted: antennas or towers located on property owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by the city, provided a permit, license, lease, or other written approval authorizing such antenna or tower has been issued by the city. 
(Ord. No. 3075-17 , § 11, 4-24-17) 
Sec. 58-426. - Administratively-approved uses. 
(a)  Generally. The following provisions shall govern the issuance of administrative approvals for towers and antennas. 
(1)  The city building official may administratively approve the uses listed in this section, subject to a site plan review by the planning and zoning commission for all uses except a site plan review shall not be required for uses on existing towers as set forth in subsection 58-426(b)(1)b. 
(2)  Each applicant for administrative approval shall provide the information set forth in subsections 58-427(c)(1) and (c)(3) and a nonrefundable fee as established by the city commission. 
(3)  The city building official shall review the application for administrative approval and determine if the proposed use complies with section 58-424 and subsections 58-427(c)(4)-(7) (except that subsections 58-427(c)(4)-(7) shall apply only to towers not located on buildings), and shall schedule a site plan review if applicable. 
(4)  In connection with any such administrative approval, the city building official may, in order to encourage tower/antenna location on existing buildings, administratively waive any separation distances between towers in subsection 58-427(c)(5)b. by up to 50 percent, and may administratively waive separation distances from off-site uses in subsection 58-427(c)(5)a. by up to 100 percent. 
(5)  In connection with any such administrative approval, the city building official may, in order to encourage the use of monopoles, administratively allow the reconstruction of an existing tower to monopole construction so long as the height of the new monopole tower does not exceed that of the existing tower. 
(6)  If an administrative approval is denied, then prior to filing any appeal that may be available under the city's Code of Ordinances or other applicable law, the applicant must file an application for a conditional use permit, to be heard by (i) the planning and zoning commission (if no site plan review by the planning and zoning commission has occurred) and (ii) the city commission. 
(b)  List of administratively-approved uses. The following uses may be approved by the city building official after conducting an administrative review, and after a site plan review by the planning and zoning commission, if applicable, or as otherwise indicated: 
(1)  Locating antennas on existing structures or towers and tower modifications consistent with the terms below: 
a.  Non-substantial tower modifications. An application to modify an existing tower or base station which does not substantially change the physical dimensions of such tower or base station shall be approved subject only to building permit review and administrative review to determine whether the proposed modification constitutes a substantial modification. A modification substantially changes the physical dimensions of a tower or base station if it meets any of the following criteria: 
1.  For towers outside of public rights-of-way, it increases the height of the tower by more than ten percent, or by the height of one additional antenna array with separation from the nearest existing antenna not to exceed 20 feet, whichever is greater; for those towers in the rights-of-way and for all base stations, it increases the height of the tower or base station by more than ten percent or ten feet, whichever is greater; 
2.  For towers outside of public rights-of-way, it protrudes from the edge of the tower more than 20 feet, or more than the width of the tower structure at the level of the appurtenance, whichever is greater; for those towers in the rights-of-way and for all base stations, it protrudes from the edge of the structure more than six feet; 
3.  It involves installation of more than the standard number of new equipment cabinets for the technology involved but not to exceed four cabinets; 
4.  It entails any excavation or deployment outside the current site of the tower or base station; 
5.  It would defeat the existing concealment elements of the tower or base station; or 
6.  It does not comply with conditions associated with the prior approval of construction or modification of the tower or base station unless the noncompliance is due to an increase in height, increase in width, addition of cabinets, or new excavation that does not exceed the corresponding "substantial change" thresholds identified above. 
The changes in height resulting from a modification should be measured from the original support structure in cases where the deployments are or will be separated horizontally, such as on buildings' rooftops; in other circumstances, changes in height should be measured from the dimensions of the tower or base station inclusive of originally approved appurtenances and any modifications that were approved prior to the passage of the Spectrum Act. 
b.  Antenna co-locations with minimal change to physical dimensions. An application to co-locate an antenna (beyond an initial, previously approved antenna) upon a tower or upon certain non-tower structures meeting the following requirements shall be approved subject only to building permit review and administrative review to determine whether the following requirements are met: 
1.  Co-location on towers, including nonconforming towers: 
i.  The co-location does not increase the height of the tower to which the antenna is to be attached, measured to the highest point of any part of the tower or any existing antenna attached to the tower; 
ii.  The co-location does not increase the ground space area, commonly known as the compound, approved in the site plan for equipment enclosures and ancillary facilities; 
iii.  The co-location consists of one or more antennas, equipment enclosures and ancillary facilities that are of a design and configuration consistent with all applicable design and aesthetic regulations, restrictions, or conditions, if any, applied to the initial antenna placed on the tower and to its accompanying equipment enclosures and ancillary facilities and, if applicable, applied to the tower supporting the antenna. 
2.  Co-location upon any structure except for a tower or historic building, structure, site, object, or district: 
i.  The co-location does not increase the height of the existing structure to which the antenna is to be attached, measured to the highest point of any part of the structure or any existing antenna attached to the structure; 
ii.  The co-location does not increase the ground space area, otherwise known as the compound, if any, approved in the site plan for equipment enclosures and ancillary facilities; 
iii.  The co-location consists of one or more antennas, equipment enclosures, and ancillary facilities that are of a design and configuration consistent with any applicable structural or aesthetic design requirements for location on the structure, but not prohibitions or restrictions on the placement of additional co-locations on the existing structure or additional procedural requirements. 
c.  Towers/antennas on existing structures. Any tower and/or antenna may be approved by the city building official as an accessory use to any commercial, industrial, professional, multifamily or institutional building, provided: 
1.  The building is at least 45 feet in height; 
2.  The building is not located in a single-family residential zoning district; 
3.  The tower or antenna does not extend more than 15 feet above the roof surface of the structure; 
4.  The tower and/or antenna(s) comply with all applicable FCC and FAA regulations; and 
5.  The tower and/or antenna(es) comply with all applicable building codes. 
d.  Antennas on existing towers. Any antenna which is proposed to be attached to an existing tower may be approved by the city building official subject to the following. To minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation and clustering of towers, co-location of antennas by more than one carrier on existing towers shall take precedence over the construction of new towers, provided such co-location is accomplished in a manner consistent with the following: 
1.  A tower which is modified or reconstructed to accommodate the co-location of an additional antenna shall be of the same tower type as the existing tower, unless the city building official allows reconstruction as monopole. 
2.  Height: 
i.  An existing tower may be modified or rebuilt to a taller height, not to exceed 30 feet over the tower's existing height to accommodate the co-location of additional antennas, but subject to the overall height limit set forth in subsection 58-424(o). 
ii.  The height change referenced in subsection 2.i., above, may only occur one time per communication tower. 
iii.  The additional height referenced in subsection 2.i., above, shall not require an additional distance separation as set forth in subsection 58-427(c)(5). The tower's pre-modification height shall be used to calculate such distance separations. 
3.  On-site location: 
i.  A tower which is being rebuilt to accommodate the co-location of an additional antenna may be moved on site within 50 feet of its existing location. 
ii.  After the tower is rebuilt to accommodate co-location, only one tower may remain on the site. 
iii.  A relocated on-site tower shall continue to be measured from the original tower location for purposes of calculating separation distances between towers pursuant to subsection 58-427(c)(5). The relocation of a tower hereunder shall in no way be deemed to cause a violation of subsection 58-427(c)(5). 
iv.  The on-site relocation of a tower which comes within the separation distances to residential units or residentially-zoned lands as established in subsection 58-427(c)(5) shall only be permitted when approved as a conditional use by the city commission. 
(2)  Locating any alternative tower structure in the C-1, C-3, I-1, or PQP zoning districts, that in the judgment of the city building official is in conformity with the goals set forth in section 58-121; 
(3)  Installing a cable microcell network through the use or multiple low-powered transmitters/receivers attached to existing wireline systems, such as conventional cable or telephone wires, or similar technology that does not require the use of towers. 
(Ord. No. 3075-17 , § 12, 4-24-17) 
Sec. 58-427. - Conditional use permits. 
(a)  Generally. Except as provided in section 58-425 or 58-426, towers and antennas shall be conditional uses in the C-1, C-3, I-1 and PQP zoning districts and shall be prohibited in all other zoning districts. 
(b)  Provisions governing issuance. The following provisions shall govern the issuance of conditional use permits for towers or antennas by the city commission: 
(1)  If the tower or antenna is not a permitted use under section 58-425 or permitted to be approved administratively pursuant to section 58-426, then a conditional use permit shall be required for the construction of a tower or the placement of an antenna in all permitted zoning districts. 
(2)  Applications for conditional use permits under this section shall be subject to the procedures and requirements of this Code of Ordinances, except as modified in this section. 
(3)  In granting a conditional use permit the city commission may impose conditions to the extent the city commission concludes such conditions are necessary to minimize any adverse effect of the proposed tower on adjoining properties. 
(4)  To the extent required by applicable law, any information of an engineering nature that the applicant submits, whether civil, mechanical, or electrical, shall be certified by a licensed professional engineer. 
(5)  An applicant for a conditional use permit shall submit the information described in this section and a nonrefundable fee as established by the city commission. 
(6)  Every conditional use permit for a tower which is 80 feet in height or taller and which is issued after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives shall automatically expire five years after the date of approval of the conditional use permit, unless a copy of a co-location lease recorded in the public records of Orange County, or some similar document deemed sufficient by the city, is delivered to the city prior to that date. The co-location lease shall indicate that one or more other service providers have entered into an agreement with the tower owner and the other service provider(s) have the right to co-locate their antennas on the tower. 
a.  If the tower applicant provides a recorded co-location lease as part of its application, the five-year expiration condition shall not be a part of the conditional use permit conditions of approval. An unrecorded copy of the co-location lease may be submitted to the city; provided, however, that no building permit shall be issued for such tower until the co-location lease is recorded in the public records of Orange County and a recorded copy is presented to the city. 
b.  Upon the passage of five years without this condition being fulfilled, the conditional use permit shall terminate and the tower removed at the applicant's expense. Notwithstanding any other remedies available at law or in equity, the city may seek an injunction to have the tower removed. 
c.  A tower conditional use permit holder may seek to continue the conditional use permit beyond five years without a recorded co-location lease evidencing co-location by filing an application for a new conditional use permit not less than 90 days prior to the expiration of the current conditional use permit. As part of the application, the applicant shall supply evidence as to the reasons co-location at the site has not been achievable. Provided the conditional use permit holder is able to document that a continuous, good faith, proactive effort has been made to secure a co-located service provider before, during and after the tower is constructed, the city shall grant a reasonable extension. 
(7)  When communication towers or antennas are proposed to be disguised as alternative tower structures the request must be reviewed by the city's town designer. 
(c)  Towers. 
(1)  Information required. In addition to any information required for applications for conditional use permits pursuant to this Code of Ordinances, applicants for a conditional use permit for a tower shall submit the following information. The application may utilize any combination of site plans, surveys, maps, technical reports or written narratives necessary to convey the following information: 
a.  A scaled site plan clearly indicating the location, type and height of the proposed tower, onsite land uses and zoning, adjacent land uses and zoning (including when adjacent to other municipalities), comprehensive plan classification of the site and all properties within the applicable separation distances set forth in subsection 58-427(c)(5), adjacent roadways, proposed means of access, setbacks from property lines, elevation drawings of the proposed tower and any other structures, topography, parking, and other information deemed by the city to be necessary to assess compliance with this article. 
b.  A current tax map and aerial as provided by the county property appraiser's office showing the location of the proposed tower. 
c.  Legal description of the parent tract and leased parcel (if applicable). 
d.  The setback distance between the proposed tower and the nearest residential unit, and nearest residentially-zoned property. 
e.  The separation distance from other towers shall be shown on an updated site plan or map. The applicant shall also identify the type of construction of the existing tower(s) and the owner/operator of the existing tower(s), if known. 
f.  A landscape plan showing specific landscape materials. 
g.  Method of fencing and finished color and, if applicable, the method of illumination. 
h.  A description of compliance with subsections 58-424(c)-(g), 58-424(j), 58-424(l) and (m), 58-427(c)(4)-(7), and all applicable federal, state or local laws. 
i.  A notarized letter signed by the applicant stating the tower will comply with all applicable state and city codes. 
j.  A notarized statement by the applicant as to whether construction of the tower will accommodate co-location of additional antennas for future users. 
k.  Identification of the entities providing the backhaul network for the tower(s) described in the application and other cellular sites owned or operated by the applicant in the city. 
l.  A description of the suitability of the use of existing towers, other structures or alternative technology not requiring the use of towers or structures to provide the services to be provided through the use of the proposed new tower. 
m.  For alternative tower structures, a colorized pictorial representation, artist's rendering or the like; design specifications, including total height, diameter and colorations. A corresponding statement accompanying the graphic representation explaining the following: what is the nature and character of the area within which the alternative tower structure is proposed, with respect to land use, surrounding environment, building heights and designs, and building/environment density; how will the proposed alternative tower structure blend in and harmonize with the nature and character of the area. 
(2)  Factors considered in granting conditional use permits for towers. In addition to any standards for consideration of conditional use permit applications pursuant to this Code of Ordinances, the city commission shall consider the following factors in determining whether to issue a conditional use permit, although the city commission may waive or reduce the burden on the applicant of one or more of these criteria if the city commission concludes that the goals of this article are better served thereby: 
a.  Height of the proposed tower; 
b.  Proximity of the tower to residential structures and residential district boundaries; 
c.  Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties; 
d.  Surrounding topography; 
e.  Surrounding tree coverage and foliage; 
f.  Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness; 
g.  Proposed ingress and egress; and 
h.  Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or alternative technologies not requiring the use of towers or structures, as addressed in subsection 58-427(c)(3). 
(3)  Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures, or alternative technology. No new tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the city commission that no existing tower, structure or alternative technology that does not require the use of towers or structures can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. An applicant shall submit information requested by the city commission related to the availability of suitable existing towers, other structures or alternative technology. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower, structure or alternative technology can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of any of the following: 
a.  No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area which meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
b.  Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
c.  Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment. 
d.  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
e.  The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable. 
f.  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
g.  The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that does not require the use of towers or structures, such as cable microcell network using multiple low-powered transmitters/receivers attached to wireline system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new tower or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology unsuitable. 
(4)  Setbacks. The following setback requirements shall apply to all towers; provided, however, that the city commission may reduce the standard setback requirements if the goals of this chapter would be better served thereby: 
a.  Towers must comply with the minimum setback requirements for principal buildings in the zoning district where the tower is located. Tower setbacks shall be measured from the base of the tower (in the case of guy wires, the location of the guy wires shall be considered as part of the base of the tower) to the property line of the parcel on which it is located. 
b.  Accessory buildings must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements. 
(5)  Separation. The following separation requirements apply to all towers and antennas. However, the city commission may reduce the separation distances by up to 50 percent from off-site uses and up to 100 percent between towers/antennas if the applicant utilizes an alternative or camouflaged tower/antenna structure and the city commission determines that this proposal achieves the aesthetic goals of this article and minimizes the negative impact upon adjacent property values. Separation shall be measured from the base of the tower/antenna to the lot line of the off-site use or to the base of the existing tower/antenna. 
a.  Separation from off-site uses. The separation from residential zoning for lattice or guyed towers/antennas of any height shall be 1,000 feet. The separation from residential zoning for monopole towers/antennas shall be six feet for every one foot of tower/antenna height. 
b.  Separation between communication towers/antennas. The separation between any two lattice or guyed communication towers/antennas shall be 5,000 feet. The separation between any lattice or guyed communication tower/antenna and a monopole shall be 3,000 feet. The separation between monopole towers/antennas shall be 35 feet for every one foot of height. 
(6)  Security fencing. A decorative brick wall not less than eight feet in height from finished grade shall be provided around the perimeter of all tower sites for ground-mounted towers. Access to the tower site shall be through a locked gate. Towers mounted on buildings shall provide security comparable to ground-mounted tower sites. 
(7)  Landscaping. The visual impacts of a tower and ancillary structures shall be mitigated for nearby viewers through landscaping or other screening materials. The following landscaping and buffering of towers shall be required around the perimeter of ground mounted towers and ancillary structures, except that the standards may be waived for those sides of the proposed tower that are located adjacent to undeveloped lands and lands not in public view. Ancillary structures include but are not limited to buildings and equipment. Further, the use of existing vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent practicable. Landscaping shall be installed on the outside of fences. Further, the use of existing vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent practicable and may be used as a substitute of or in supplement toward meeting landscaping requirements. The following requirements shall apply to tower sites: 
a.  A row of shade trees, a minimum of eight feet tall and spaced to give optimum growth (eight feet to 20 feet depending on variety) shall be planted and maintained at locations surrounding the tower and buildings and equipment such that the maximum screening from adjacent lands and rights-of-way are achieved. 
b.  A continuous hedge at least 30 inches high at planting capable of growing to at least 36 inches in height within 18 months shall be planted and maintained in front of the tree lines referenced above. 
c.  All hedge material shall be of the evergreen variety. 
d.  All landscaping shall be xeriscape tolerant or irrigated and properly maintained to insure good health and viability. 
(Ord. No. 2422-01, § 1, 6-12-01; Ord. No. 2431-01, § 1, 8-14-01) 
Sec. 58-428. - Other requirements. 
(a)  The equipment cabinet or structure used in association with towers and antennas shall be no larger than is reasonably necessary to accommodate the service provider's equipment and machinery which is required to operate the antenna(s). 
(b)  No cellular or two-way radio communication tower/antenna shall create any interference or interruption with the service for the city's radio communications system or any other emergency public safety radio system network at any time. Prior to the installation of any new cellular or two-way radio tower/antenna and after the antenna is operational by the carrier, an engineering test of the radio frequency shall be conducted to verify that no interference or interruption of the city's or other public safety radio system will occur or has occurred due to the installation of the antenna. In the event such interference or interruption occurs after antennas are functional, the company operating such antenna shall be required to immediately remedy and remove such interference upon notice from the city. 
(Ord. No. 2422-01, § 2, 6-12-01) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2422-01, § 2, adopted June 12, 2001, repealed the former § 58-428, and enacted a new § 58-428 as set out herein. The former § 58-428 pertained to buildings or other equipment storage and derived from the original codification. 
Sec. 58-429. - Removal of abandoned antennas and towers. 
(a)  The city commission finds and declares that, because of the national public policy of insuring that the wireless communications industry and its evolving new technologies are accommodated notwithstanding the undesirable effects that towers may have on the aesthetics of communities and neighborhoods, there is a compelling public interest in insuring that towers are promptly disassembled, dismantled and removed once they are no longer being used. Further, the city commission finds that there is substantial risk that towers may cease being used in large numbers if there is a concentration or consolidation of competitors within the industry or if even newer technologies arise, eliminating the need for towers. 
(b)  Accordingly, any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 180 days shall be deemed to be abandoned. Determination of the date of abandonment shall be made by the city building official who shall have the right to request documentation and/or affidavits from the tower owner/operator regarding the issue of tower usage and other information. Failure or refusal for any reason by the owner/operator to respond within 20 days to such a request shall constitute prima facie evidence that the tower has been abandoned. Upon a determination of abandonment and notice thereof to the owner/operator, the owner/operator of the tower shall have 180 days within which to: 
(1)  Reactivate the use of the tower or antenna or transfer the tower to another owner/operator who makes actual use of the tower or antenna within the 180-day period; or 
(2)  Dismantle and remove the tower or antenna. 
(c)  At the earlier of 181 days after the date of abandonment without reactivation or upon completion of dismantling and removal, any conditional use and/or variance approval for the tower shall automatically expire. 
(d)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection 58-429(b), upon abandonment of a tower as determined under subsection 58-429(b) by the city building official and the failure or refusal of the owner/operator of the tower or antenna to either reactivate the tower or antenna or dismantle and remove it within 180 days as required by subsection 58-429(b), the following persons or entities (the "responsible parties") shall have the duty jointly and severally to remove the abandoned tower or antenna: 
(1)  The owner of the abandoned tower/antenna (and, if different, the operator of the abandoned tower/antenna);

The lien of the assessment shall bear interest and shall have priority and be collectible at the same rate and in like manner as provided under state law and this Code of Ordinances for special assessments. 
Sec. 58-430. - Documentation, performance bond or deposit for removal. 
    Prior to receiving a building permit for the construction of a tower, the applicant shall provide either: 
(1)  Documentation supplied to the city sufficient to demonstrate that an adequate methodology and/or sufficient funds are dedicated to and available for removal of the tower structure upon abandonment (by way of example and not limitation, sufficient documentation would include evidence that the tower owner has an obligation under the governing lease to dismantle and remove the tower upon abandonment); or

The adequate amount shall be $30.00 per foot of height for monopole towers and $100.00 per foot of height for lattice of guyed towers. In no event shall any one service provider be required to place more than $30,000.00 into the account for the cumulative number of towers under its control and located within the city. 
Sec. 58-431. - Nonconforming uses. 
(a)  Not expansion of nonconforming use. Towers that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance with the provisions of this article, shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion of a nonconforming use or structure. 
(b)  Preexisting towers. Preexisting towers shall be allowed to continue their usage as they presently exist. Routine maintenance (including replacement with a new tower of like construction and height) shall be permitted on such preexisting towers. New construction other than routine maintenance on a preexisting tower shall comply with the requirements of this article. 
(c)  Rebuilding damaged or destroyed nonconforming towers or antennas. Notwithstanding section 58-129, bona fide nonconforming towers or antennas that are damaged or destroyed may be rebuilt without having to first obtain administrative approval or a conditional use permit and without having to meet the separation requirements specified in subsections 58-427(c)(4) and (5). The type, height, and location of the tower onsite shall be of the same type and intensity as the original facility approval. The rebuilt facility shall comply with the then applicable building codes and the required building permits shall be obtained within 180 days from the date the facility is damaged or destroyed, subject to the requirements of section 58-424(g). If no permit is obtained or if such permit expires, the tower or antenna shall be deemed abandoned as specified in section 58-429. 
(d)  Future nonconforming uses. If at any time after January 1, 2013, the city commission finds (1) that the technologies pertaining to towers have changed such that wireless communications can be readily provided with no towers or with towers or other structures that are substantially less intrusive to residential and commercial areas and substantially more aesthetic for neighborhoods and commercial areas and (2) that the service providers in the city are making frequent use of the new technologies in the installation of new communication systems or the expansion of existing systems (whether such installations or expansions are occurring in the city or elsewhere), the city commission may declare to be nonconforming uses all towers then existing in residential, professional office, and commercial zones in the city and which have been erected pursuant to building permits issued on or after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives. The city commission shall declare such towers to be nonconforming uses in an ordinance which amends this Code of Ordinances to make such towers nonpermitted uses altogether in residential, professional office, and commercial zones and, simultaneously, to make the new technologies permitted uses or conditional uses in those zones. The city commission may then set such time limits as are reasonable and legally permissible for the service providers and tower owner/operators to remove the nonconforming towers and replace them with the new technologies. This section shall be effective only if and to the extent not prohibited or preempted by state or federal law. 
Sec. 58-432. - Appeals. 
    Final, written decisions of the building official or the planning and zoning commission under this article may be appealed as provided in section 58-94 of this Code of Ordinances. There shall be no right to an appeal of a decision by the city commission under this article except as provided by law.

DIVISION 3. - DESIGNATION OF HISTORIC LANDMARKS, RESOURCES OR DISTRICTS 

Sec. 58-456. - Designation criteria. 
    In order to qualify as a local historic landmark, resource or district, properties must be in keeping with the intent and purpose of the Winter Park Historic Preservation Code as set forth in section 58-433. The eligibility of any potential historic landmark, resource or district shall be supported by meeting applicable criteria based upon the National Register of Historic Places guidelines criteria for evaluation at the local, state or national level. Properties must be at least 50 years old to be eligible for designation unless they are of exceptional importance. 
(1)  The criteria for the designation of historic landmarks and historic resources are as follows: 
a.  A quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and associations; and 
b.  At least one of the following: 
1.  That are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history; or 
2.  That are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or 
3.  That embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction; or 
4.  That represent the work of a master; or 
5.  That possess high artistic values; or 
6.  That represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or 
7.  Those have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history. 
(2)  Historic districts must meet the criteria of subsection 58-456(1)a. and two or more of the criteria in subsection 58-456(1)b. at the local, state or national level. A district shall possess a significant concentration, linkage, or continuity of sites, buildings, structures or objects united historically or aesthetically by plan or physical development. 
a.  The identity of a district results from the interrelationship of its resources, which can convey a visual sense of the historic environment or be an arrangement of historically or functionally related properties. At least 50 percent of the sites, buildings, structures or objects in a historic district must meet two or more of the National Register of Historic Places criteria at the local, state or national level. 
b.  A district must contain a minimum of 12 properties. A district must be a definable geographic area of contiguous properties and, where possible, should cover both sides of any street or comprise all the properties in any cul-de-sac or similar area and generally follow the technical guidelines for selecting boundaries used by the National Register of Historic Places. The boundaries must be based upon a shared relationship among the properties constituting the district and represent the area which completed the process described in subsection 58-457(2). The boundaries should be defined by utilizing the parcels and lots as shown on the Orange County Property Appraiser's maps. 
c.  If the nomination for designation of a particular district pursuant to subsection 58-457(2) below is unsuccessful, no district nomination including the selected area shall be presented for nomination for at least three (3) years after the date the city notifies the proposed district's residents that the nomination has been unsuccessful. 
(Ord. No. 2688-06, § 1, Exh. A(58-442), 10-9-06; Ord. No. 3024-15 , § 1(Exh. A), 12-14-15) 
Sec. 58-457. - Designation procedures. 
    Winter Park historic landmarks, resources and districts shall be designated only as provided in this section. Properties, which meet the criteria for designation as set forth in section 58-456, shall be designated according to the following procedures: 
(1)  Designation of local historic landmarks and resources. 
a.  Recommendations for nomination for designation of individual local historic landmarks and resources may be submitted to the planning and community development department by the property owner(s), who believe(s) that the property meets the criteria for listing as set forth in section 58-456. The property owner shall provide to the city proof of current fee simple ownership of the property being nominated. The proposal shall include a legal description or address of the property, a brief statement regarding its historic, cultural, aesthetic or architectural significance, and must include written authorization by the property owner(s). 
b.  Prior to consideration of designation, the city shall first determine if the property sought to be designated meets the criteria for designation. If so, the city shall prepare a historic designation report that shall be presented to the HPB at a regularly scheduled meeting. 
c.  For each proposed designation of a historic landmark or resource, the city is responsible for mailing a notice of public hearing to all property owners of record on the latest Orange County tax roll within a 500-foot radius of the proposed landmark or resource at least 15 days prior to the public hearing held pursuant to this section, however, failure to receive such notice shall not invalidate the same as such notice shall also be given by publishing a copy thereof in a newspaper of general circulation at least 15 days prior to the hearing. 
(2)  Local historic districts. 
a.  Nominations for designation of historic districts may be submitted to the planning and community development department by petition from 20 percent of the proposed district property owners, at least half of whom shall be owners of individually designated historic homes in the proposed district, or owners of contributing homes in the proposed district who believe that the district meets the criteria for listing as set forth in section 58-456. The nomination shall include a description of the proposed boundaries of the district, and a brief statement setting forth: 
1.  That at least 50 percent of the homes in the proposed district are individually designated historic homes or contributing homes; 
2.  Explaining its historic, cultural, aesthetic or architectural significance; 
3.  The specific National Register of Historic Places criteria (two or more) that apply to the proposed district; and 
4.  Including required petition representing the ownership of at least 20 percent of the properties within the proposed district as described above. 
Designation of historic districts shall only be considered by the HPB subsequent to meetings with district property owners and actions as described in subsections b. and c. below. 
b.  Prior to consideration of designation by the HPB, the city shall first determine if the proposed district meets the criteria for designation as set forth in the petition. If so, the city shall then prepare a historic designation report which shall analyze and report upon: 
1.  Proposed boundaries; 
2.  Contributing and noncontributing buildings and elements; 
3.  District goals; 
4.  Design guidelines to include district alteration criteria; 
5.  Effects of designation; and 
6.  Available incentives. 
The city shall then mail the report and other necessary information to each property owner of record to notify them of the initial interest in establishing a historic district, the effects of establishing a historic district, and a schedule of informational meetings for owners and interested parties. The schedule of informational meetings will also be published in a newspaper of general circulation and posted on the city's web site. The city shall then facilitate conferences with property owners within the nominated district to discuss the proposed district. The city shall have 90 days to complete these requirements. 
c.  After informational meetings have concluded, the city will mail a summarized final historic designation report to every property owner of record in the nominated district as of that date. The report will describe the voting process including a 14-day deadline to respond. The final report, voting process and deadline will also be posted on the city's website. Property owners of record will be polled, with each property representing one vote. If a property is jointly owned by two or more persons or entities, all such persons or entities having an ownership interest in that property must agree in order to cast a vote in favor of creating the nominated district. Upon receipt of a favorable vote representing the ownership of two-thirds of the properties within the nominated district, a historic designation report shall be forwarded to the HPB recommending approval or disapproval of the nominated area as a historic district based upon the vote received and citing any other specific criteria for the decision. 
d.  The nominated historic district shall have a historic designation report that shall be presented to the HPB at a regularly scheduled meeting. The designation report shall include the historic context, proposed boundaries, contributing and noncontributing elements, a staff recommendation and the results of listing which may include guidelines for review, and appropriate incentives. For each proposed designation of a historic district, the city is responsible for mailing a notice of public hearing to all property owners of record whose property is located within the boundary of the designation 15 days prior to the public hearing held pursuant to this section, however failure to receive such notice shall not invalidate the same as such notice shall also be given by publishing a copy thereof in a newspaper of general circulation in the city and county at least 15 days prior to the hearing. 
(3)  Decision of the HPB. If, after a public hearing, the HPB finds that the proposed local historic landmark, resource or district meets the criteria set forth in section 58-456, it shall transmit such findings to the city commission along with the recommendation that the designation be approved. The historic landmark or resource shall only be recorded in the Winter Park Register of Historic Places following adoption of a resolution of the city commission approving such designation. The designation of a historic district shall only be created following the adoption of an ordinance of the city commission approving such designation.

DIVISION 4. - CERTIFICATE OF REVIEW 

Sec. 58-466. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the certificate of review process is to assist owners of historical landmarks or resources and owners in historic districts who plan to rehabilitate, restore or redevelop their property for contemporary use to achieve their goals and take advantage of incentive programs while preserving the historic character, architecture and materials, to the greatest extent possible. 
(Ord. No. 2688-06, § 1, Exh. A(Div. IV), 10-9-06; Ord. No. 3024-15 , § 1(Exh. A), 12-14-15) 
Sec. 58-467. - Pre-application conference. 
    Before entering binding commitments or incurring substantial expense in the preparation of plans, surveys and other data, and before submitting an application for a certificate of review, an applicant shall confer with the city HPB staff to obtain information and guidance. The purpose of such conference is to further discuss and clarify conservation objectives and design guidelines in cases that do not conform to established objectives and the land development code. In no case shall any statement or representation made prior to the official application review be binding on the HPB, the city commission or any city departments. 
(Ord. No. 2688-06, § 1, Exh. A(58-444), 10-9-06; Ord. No. 3024-15 , § 1(Exh. A), 12-14-15) 
Sec. 58-468. - Review requirement.

    Provided however, the HPB shall not have the authority to review and render a decision on interior alterations to structures that do not affect the exterior or structural integrity of the structure. The HPB may approve, approve with conditions, or deny an application. For reconstructed buildings that have been permitted pursuant to section 58-482, the provisions of this section shall still apply. 
(Ord. No. 2688-06, § 1, Exh. A(58-445), 10-9-06; Ord. No. 3024-15 , § 1(Exh. A), 12-14-15) 
Sec. 58-469. - Guidelines for review. 
    It shall be the intent of the HPB to preserve the exterior historic characteristics of the landmark, resource or district, and to promote maintenance, restoration, adaptive reuses appropriate to the property, and compatible contemporary designs which are harmonious with the exterior architectural and landscape features of neighboring buildings, sites, and streetscapes. Guidelines shall also serve as criteria for staff to make decisions, as permitted by the HPB, regarding applications for administrative certificates of review. 
(1)  The U.S. Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, as periodically revised, are generally the standards and guidelines by which applications for any certificate of review for historic buildings, sites, or districts are to be measured and evaluated. The HPB may recommend additional standards to preserve and protect special features unique to the city or may recommend amending any existing guidelines to the city commission. 
(2)  Variances to achieve the design review standards for historic preservation may be granted from the land development code requirements for the purposes of this chapter, provided the variance does not negatively affect the character of the area and with good cause shown. These variances may include those for building height, side, rear and front setbacks, building coverage, floor area ratio, impervious coverage, stormwater retention, and walls and fences. Building code exemptions may be granted subject to the guidelines of the Florida Building Code for qualified historic buildings or structures. Additional information to justify variances and exemptions may be needed. 
a.  When a variance or exception is considered, the application shall comply with the notice standards listed in subsection 58-89(c)(2). 
b.  All variance requests through the HPB certificate of review process shall be limited to properties with individual landmark, resource or historic district designation. This landmark, resource or district designation must be completed before issuance of a building permit for the work that requires a variance. 
c.  The appeal of a decision to grant or deny a variance by any person aggrieved by the decision of the HPB shall be taken to the city commission after following the notice criteria of subsection 58-89(c)(2) if filed within 15 days of the date of the decision by the HPB. 
(3)  The HPB may also allow garage apartments or accessory cottages to be determined to be conforming uses on designated historic landmarks or resources, or on properties in a designated historic district. 
a.  Historic designation must be completed before the issuance of a building permit or approval for the construction, re-establishment or construction of a new garage apartment or accessory cottage. 
b.  Building setbacks shall be determined by the HPB, however, no garage apartment or accessory cottage shall be closer than five feet to a rear or side line, unless such setback currently exists, or may be in a required front setback. 
c.  It is desirable that garage apartments or accessory cottages not exceed 750 square feet of living area. The HPB may reduce or enlarge this square-foot limitation depending on the configuration or size of the property; provided, however, garage apartments or accessory cottages shall not exceed 1,000 square feet in size. 
d.  Conversion of any existing garage space shall not be allowed, but an existing garage may be enlarged in height or ground area to accommodate the garage apartment. Garage apartments or accessory cottages may utilize a separate electric meter and utility connections contingent upon meeting the parking requirements for an accessory dwelling unit. 
e.  Tenants must be provided on-site parking space(s) behind the front setback of the principal residence. All required parking spaces must be accessed independently and shall not require moving any vehicle to allow another vehicle to enter or exit from the property. All vehicles shall be parked on site in spaces conforming to setbacks so that no regular daytime or overnight parking occurs on city streets. Violation of these terms and conditions may result in enforcement action by code compliance. 
(4)  Each designated historic district may adopt specific district guidelines for design review based upon the U.S. Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, as periodically revised, subject to final approval by the HPB. 
(5)  Local guidelines for design review may be adopted based upon the U.S. Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation, as periodically revised.

DIVISION 6. - TAX EXEMPTIONS FOR HISTORIC PROPERTIES 

Sec. 58-510. - Reserved. 
Sec. 58-511. - Scope of tax exemptions for restoration, renovation or rehabilitation. 
    F.S. § 196.1997 establishes a method for the city commission to allow tax exemptions for the restoration, renovation or rehabilitation of historic properties. The exemption shall apply to 100 percent of the assessed value of all improvements to historic properties, which result from restoration, renovation or rehabilitation made on or after the effective date of an approved application. The exemption applies only to taxes levied by the city. The exemption does not apply to taxes levied for the payment of bonds or to taxes authorized by a vote of the electors pursuant to Section 9(b) or Section 12, Article VII of the Florida State Constitution. The exemption does not apply to personal property. 
(Ord. No. 2688-06, § 1, Exh. A(58-476), 10-9-06; Ord. No. 3024-15 , § 1(Exh. A), 12-14-15) 
Sec. 58-512. - Duration of tax exemptions. 
    Any exemption granted under section 58-511 to a particular property may remain in effect for ten years as specified in the ordinance approving the exemption. The duration of ten years may continue regardless of any change in the authority of the city to grant such exemptions or any changes in ownership of the property. In order to retain an exemption, however, the historic character of the property, and improvements, which qualified the property for an exemption, must be maintained over the period for which the exemption was granted. 
(Ord. No. 2688-06, § 1, Exh. A(58-477), 10-9-06; Ord. No. 3024-15 , § 1(Exh. A), 12-14-15) 
Sec. 58-513. - Eligible properties and improvements. 
(a)  Property is qualified for an exemption under section 58-511 if: 
(1)  At the time the exemption is granted, the property is: 
a.  Individually listed in the National Register of Historic Places pursuant to the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended; 
b.  A contributing property within a National Register listed district; or 
c.  Individually listed in the Winter Park Register of Historic Places or noted as a contributing structure within a designated local historic district as enacted by ordinance of the city commission. 
(2)  The HPB has certified to the city commission that the property for which an exemption is requested satisfies subsection (a)(1) above. 
(b)  In order for an improvement to a historic property to qualify the property for an exemption the improvement must be: 
(1)  Consistent with the United States Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and/or local design guidelines for historic preservation, and 
(2)  Determined by the HPB to meet criteria established in rules adopted by the department of state if the city is a certified local government, or by the department of state division of historic resources. 
(c)  Property is qualified under subsection 58-513(b) above if the property meets the following criteria: 
(1)  The property must be used for commercial purposes or used by a not-for-profit organization under Section 501(c)(3) or (6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; or 
(2)  The property must be listed in the National Register of Historic Places, as defined in F.S. § 267.021; or 
(3)  Must be a local historic contributing property to a National Register Historic District; or must be a locally designated historic landmark or a contributing property within a locally designated historic district; and 
(4)  The property must be regularly open to the public, which means that there are regular hours when the public may visit to observe the historically significant aspects of the building. This means a minimum of 40 hours per week for 45 weeks per year, or an equivalent of 1,800 hours per year. A fee may be charged to the public, however, it must be comparable with other entrance fees in the immediate geographic locale. 
    Only those portions of the property used predominantly for the purposes specified in subsection 58-513(c) shall receive the ad valorem tax exemption of up to 50 percent of the assessed property value. In no event shall an incidental use of property qualify such property for an exemption or impair the exemption of an otherwise exempt property. In order to retain the exemption, the historic character of the property must be maintained in good repair and condition to the extent necessary to preserve the historic value and significance of the property. 
(Ord. No. 2688-06, § 1, Exh. A(58-478), 10-9-06; Ord. No. 3024-15 , § 1(Exh. A), 12-14-15) 
Sec. 58-514. - Applications. 
(a)  Any person, firm or corporation that desires ad valorem tax exemption from the improvement of a historic property must, in the year the exemption is desired to take effect, file with the historic preservation staff a written application on a form approved by the Florida Department of State. All applicable fees shall be paid at the time the application is submitted. The application must include the following information: 
(1)  The name of the property owner and the location of the historic property. 
(2)  A description of the improvements to real property for which an exemption is requested and the date of commencement of construction of such improvement. 
(3)  Proof to the satisfaction of the HPB that the property that is to be rehabilitated or renovated is a historic property under this section. 
(4)  Proof to the satisfaction of the HPB that the improvements to the property will be consistent with the United States Secretary of Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and will be made in accordance with guidelines developed by the Florida Department of State. 
(5)  Other information identified in appropriate Florida Department of State regulations. 
(b)  Following approval by the city commission, any person, firm or corporation who is claiming the ad valorem tax exemption provided under Section 513(b) shall, on or before March 1 of each year, file an application for exemption with the Orange County Property Appraiser describing the property for which exemption and certifying its ownership and use. 
(Ord. No. 2688-06, § 1, Exh. A(58-479), 10-9-06; Ord. No. 3024-15 , § 1(Exh. A), 12-14-15) 
Sec. 58-515. - Required restrictive covenant. 
    To qualify for an exemption the property must enter into a covenant or agreement with the city commission for the term for which the exemption is granted. The form of the covenant must be established by the Florida Department of State and must require that the character of the property, and the qualifying improvements to the property, be maintained during the period that the exemption is granted. The covenant or agreement shall be binding on the current property owner, transferees, and their heirs, successors or assigns. Violations of the covenant or agreement results in the property owner being subject to the payment of the differences between the total amount of taxes which would have been doe in March in each of the previous years in which the covenant or agreement was in effect had the property not received the exemption and the total amount of taxes actually paid in those years plus interest on the difference calculated as provided in F.S. § 212.12(3).

Sec. 58-516. - Review by the HPB historic preservation board. 
    The HPB or its successor is designated to review applications for exemptions. The HPB must recommend that the city commission grant or deny the exemption. Such reviews must be conducted in accordance with rules adopted by the Florida Department of State. The recommendation and the reason therefore must be provided to the applicant and to the city commission before consideration of the application at an official meeting.

Sec. 58-517. - Approval by the city commission. 
    A majority vote of the city commission shall be required to approve a written application for exemption. Such exemption shall take effect on the January 1 following substantial completion of the improvement. The city commission shall include the following in the decision approving the written application for exemption: 
(1)  The name of the property owner and the address of the historic property for which the exemption is granted. 
(2)  The period of time for which the exemption will remain in effect and the expiration date of the exemption.

Sec. 62-79. - Prohibition against picketing before or about a dwelling unit. 
(a)  Definitions. 
(1)  "Picket"; "picketing"; and "protest". The terms "picket", "picketing" and "protest" shall all mean, for purposes of this section, any assembly of one or more persons, who, through conduct, speech or other form of expression, criticize, protest or complain about any matter in which a particular person, group of persons or type of person is specifically targeted for protest, complaint or criticism, and where such assembly stands, loiters, congregates or mills before or about a dwelling unit in which a person who is a target or subject of such protest resides or is perceived to reside. 
One or more persons may be considered picketing or protesting within the meaning of this section even if the message being communicated is intended to be heard or seen by persons in addition to the resident or residents inside a dwelling unit. 
(2)  The term "dwelling unit" shall mean a building or portion thereof that is designed for residential occupancy, and shall include single-family homes, zero lot line residences, townhomes or connected homes, and duplexes, and other single- and multi-family dwelling units located in the R-1AAA lakefront district, R-1AA, R-1A, R-2, R-3, R-4 and PURD zoning districts. Where a single-family residence is grandfathered in another zoning district and is still used for single-family residential purposes it shall be included in this definition. Excluded from this definition are apartment buildings and condominiums located in a commercial zoning district. 
(3)  The term "buffer area" shall mean that area of public property, including any park, public street, public right-of-way, or sidewalk, located within an area that extends 50 linear feet in any direction measured from the property line of a dwelling unit. Privately owned property shall not be considered to be included in the buffer area, although the laws of trespass shall apply. 
(b)  Findings. It is essential to the harmony, peace and tranquility of persons residing in residential dwelling units in the City of Winter Park that they feel free in their own homes, and safe from protests and picketing activity that targets them or that is directed at them because the persons picketing have assumed that the residents are a member of a group or a type being targeted. The importance of peace and tranquility in one's own home is of compelling significance, and is of crucial importance in the City of Winter Park. The city intends to protect this interest through its governing Code of Ordinances as allowed by law. See Frisby v. Shultz, 487 U.S. 474 (1988) and Cary v. Brown, 447 U.S. 455 (1980). 
(c)  Prohibition against protest and picketing before or about a dwelling unit. It shall be unlawful for any person or persons to picket, protest or conduct any picketing or protesting activity within a buffer area of 50 feet from the property line of any dwelling unit in the City of Winter Park. It shall also be unlawful for any person or persons to picket, protest or conduct any picketing or protesting activity in any park, public street, public right-of-way, or on a sidewalk, where such activity impedes or interferes with the rights of others to travel on or in such areas in a safe manner, consistent with the traditional pedestrian, bicycle or motor vehicle use of such areas. 
(d)  Enforcement and penalty for violation. A person violating the provisions of this section shall be guilty of an offense punishable as provided in section 1-7 of the Municipal Code. In addition, a knowing violation of this section shall constitute a second-degree misdemeanor, and enforcement methods may include, but are not limited to, the issuance of a citation, summons, notice to appear in county court or arrest for violation of municipal ordinances as provided for in F.S. ch. 901, including § 901.15(1). Enforcement may also be made pursuant to the provisions of F.S. ch. 162, including § 162.22, such that a person convicted of violating this section may be sentenced to pay a fine not to exceed $500.00 for each violation and may be sentenced to a definite term of imprisonment not to exceed 60 days in a facility as authorized by law. 
(e)  These provisions supplement other provisions of the Municipal Code. The provisions of this section supplement other provisions of law and the Municipal Code that protect the public order and safety, including, but not limited to those provisions of law prohibiting obstruction or interference with passage on a public right-of-way, sidewalk or street, and those laws that prohibit trespass, assault, battery, destruction of property or other injury to person or property. 
(f)  Alternative means. The city manager shall, on application, make available city-owned land reasonably near or abutting a residential zoning district for any protest or picket, subject to all laws applying to the conduct of persons engaged in the picket. And, nothing herein prohibits a protest or picketing in a commercially zoned area, so long as the conduct of such is otherwise lawful.

Sec. 62-92. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    "A" Level means the total sound level of all noise as measured with a sound level meter using the "A" weighting network. The unit of measurement is the dBA. 
    Commercial area means an area classified by the zoning code as primarily commercial (to include areas zoned C-1, C-2, C-3), light industrial and warehouse (to include areas zoned I-1) and office (to include areas zoned O-1, O-2). 
    Decibel means a unit of measurement for sound pressure level at a specified location. 
    Emergency means any occurrence or set of circumstances involving actual or imminent physical trauma or property damage which demands immediate action. 
    Emergency work means any work performed for the purpose of preventing or alleviating the physical trauma or property damage threatened or caused by an emergency. 
    Illegal open house party means any gathering of three or more persons unrelated by blood or marriage in a residence or in or adjacent to a neighborhood zoned for residential uses at which underage consumption of alcohol or use of illegal or controlled substances occurs.

(4)  Is loud or raucous; 
(5)  Causes actual or imminent interference with peace or good order; or

    Plainly audible sound means any sound that can be detected by a person using his or her unaided hearing faculties. As an example, if the sound source under investigation is a portable or personal vehicular sound amplification or reproduction device, the detection of the rhythmic base component of the music is sufficient to verify plainly audible sound. A person need not determine the title, specific words, or the artist performing the song. 
    Real property line means an imaginary line along the surface and its vertical plane extension which separates the real property owned, rented or leased by one person from that owned, rented or leased by another person, excluding intrabuilding real property divisions. 
    Residential area means an area classified by the zoning code as residential. 
    Sound level meter means any instrument including a microphone, amplifier, an output meter, and frequency waiting networks for the measurement of noise and sound levels in a specific manner and which complies with standards established by the American National Standards Institute specifications for sound level meters S1.4. 1971, as amended.

(b)  The City Commission of the City of Winter Park hereby adopts the provisions of F.S. § 775.21(3)(a), which state as follows: 
"Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use physical violence, and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their offenses, and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant." 
(c)  The City Commission of the City of Winter Park hereby adopts the provisions of F.S. § 947.1405(8), which provides, in pertinent part, that: 
"It is the finding of the Legislature that the population of offenders released from state prison into the community who meet the conditional release criteria poses the greatest threat to the public safety of the groups of offenders under community supervision. Therefore, the Department of Corrections is to provide intensive supervision by experienced correctional probation officers to conditional release offenders." 
(d)  It is the intent of this ordinance to serve the city's compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City of Winter Park by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or permanent residence. 
(e)  The City Commission of the City of Winter Park hereby finds and determines that the provisions of this ordinance advance a legitimate public purpose and promotes and protects the public health, safety, morals and welfare of the public.

(b)  A property owner's failure to comply with the provisions of this section shall constitute a violation of this section and shall subject the property owner to the code enforcement provisions and procedures as provided in of this Code, including action before code enforcement board and the issuance of citation by a police officer as a class III violation. In the alternative, the city may pursue any other enforcement action or legal remedy available under controlling state law, including but not limited to injunctive relief.

Sec. 70-10. - Regulation of street performers. 
(a)  Intent. The City Commission of the City of Winter Park recognizes that street performers, as defined in this section, are afforded rights defined in established federal and Florida law relating to freedom of expression and freedom of speech. The city commission further desires to balance such rights with significant and substantial governmental interests related to the public health, safety, and welfare as outlined herein. The city commission finds that street performers in certain areas of the city defined herein and designated as the prohibited public area have interfered with and have a substantial likelihood of interfering with pedestrian and vehicular traffic of the city, including residents, business owners and occupants, and visitors and tourists by, among other things, attracting audiences which congest the prohibited public area, increase the likelihood for conflict and disorderliness, and may impede the ability of emergency response personnel to reach various locations. Moreover, such street performers may cause or contribute to pedestrian and vehicular safety risks through increased congestion, sight obstruction and obfuscation, and obstruction of pedestrian rights-of-way and crosswalks. The city finds that the existence of street performers in the prohibited public area adversely affects the city's interests in maintaining the aesthetics of the prohibited public area and character of same in a city with a unique historic downtown district. Additionally, the city finds that such street performers adversely affect the interests of residents and code compliant businesses and museums in the enjoyment of peace, repose, and quiet in their homes, businesses, and museums. Therefore, it is the intent of the city to regulate and limit street performers from performing in the prohibited public area of the city. It is the further intention of the city to balance the above-referenced regulations and governmental interests with the recognized rights of street performers to practice freedom of speech and freedom of expression to their intended audiences. Accordingly, the city further intends for street performers subject to these provisions to be afforded ample alternative channels of communication and expression and reasonable access to proximate performance areas where the street performers may reach their intended audience. 
(b)  Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following words, terms, and phrases, shall have the following meanings subscribed to them except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Perform and performance means to engage in any of the following activities: acting; singing; playing musical instruments; puppetry; pantomiming, miming; performing or demonstrating magic or acts of illusion; dancing; juggling; or the public display of and composition or creation of crafts, sculpture, artistry, writings, or compositions, including the application of brush, pastel, crayon, pencil, or other similar objects applied to paper, cardboard, canvas, cloth or to other similar medium. 
    Prohibited public area means the pedestrian accessed public areas of the central business and Hannibal Square districts along Park Avenue from Fairbanks Avenue to Swoope Avenue, and along New England Avenue from Park Avenue to Pennsylvania Avenue including the area within 50 feet of the public right-of-way of Park Avenue and New England Avenue on the public lanes, streets, thoroughfares, and ways, including the Winter Park train station and the public property at what is known as the Winter Park Farmer's Market and the Winter Park Historical Association located at 200 West New England Avenue, excluding public performance zones as provided in subsection (d)(2). A map of the prohibited public area is attached as exhibit "1". 
    Prohibited street performer activity means any activity performed, effectuated, or directed by any street performer during a performance that involves the utilization of any spray painting, or the use of aerosols or propellants, including air pressure, to spray or apply any liquid.

    Street performer means individuals or groups who perform in a public area or areas for the purpose of providing public entertainment or whose performance otherwise has the effect of drawing a crowd or audience.

(1)  Public areas not encompassed in the prohibited public area. Street performers may perform in all public areas of the city where the public is allowed, including, without limitation, the public performance zone(s) provided in subsection (d)(2) except those areas designated as the prohibited public area as set forth in subsection (b)(3) of this section. Notwithstanding the preceding, street performers shall not perform in locations or in a manner that: 
a.  Unreasonably interferes with, obstructs, or obfuscates the visibility or sight distances of any motorist traveling on or entering or exiting any street, thoroughfare, or right-of-way of the city; 
b.  Unreasonably interferes with, obstructs, or impedes the safe and orderly movement of pedestrian traffic proximate to city crosswalks; or 
c.  Is in violation of any other city ordinance. 
(2)  Public performance zone(s).

The location of the public performance zone(s) shall at all times be reasonably proximate to the prohibited public area to ensure that street performers may reach their intended audiences. A map of the public performance zone(s) shall be provided upon request. Notwithstanding the preceding, the city manager or his or her designee may restrict, limit, or modify any public performance zone(s) for special events or private events where street performers would likely interfere with the event or portions thereof. To the extent such special events or private events necessitate the closing of customary public performance zone(s), the city manager or his or her designee may provide alternative or additional public performance zone(s) as identified on the attached appendix "1-4" or as may otherwise be designated as necessary. All street performers who perform in any public performance zone(s) shall not perform in a location or in a manner that is in violation of any other city ordinance.

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, for Credited Service on and after October 1, 2011, Salary shall exclude payments for overtime in excess of three hundred (300) hours per calendar year, excluding overtime worked as part of a member's regular work schedule, and payments for accrued annual leave, except that payments for accrued annual leave accrued as of October 1, 2011 may be included in Salary for pension purposes even if payment is not actually made until on or after October 1, 2011 provided, however, the amount of accrued annual leave accrued as of October 1, 2011 that may be included in Salary for pension purposes shall be reduced by the actual amount of annual leave used by the Member on or after October 1, 2011 as follows: 
A.  For Members with thirteen (13) years or more Credited Service as of October 1, 2011, the amount of accrued annual leave included in Salary shall be calculated by reducing the amount of accrued annual leave as of October 1, 2011 by the actual amount of annual leave used by the Member on or after that date on a last in first out (LIFO) basis; and 
B.  For Members with less than thirteen (13) years of Credited Service as of October 1, 2011, the amount of annual leave included in Salary shall be calculated by reducing the amount of accrued annual leave as of October 1, 2011 by the actual amount of annual leave used by the Member on or after that date on a first in first out (FIFO) basis. 
Compensation in excess of limitations set forth in Section 401(a)(17) of the Code as of the first day of the Plan Year shall be disregarded for any purpose, including employee contributions or any benefit calculations.

Compensation means compensation during the fiscal year. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination period that begins with or within such calendar year. If the determination period consists of fewer than twelve (12) months, the annual compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period, and the denominator of which is twelve (12).

The limitation on compensation for an "eligible employee" shall not be less than the amount which was allowed to be taken into account hereunder as in effect on July 1, 1993. "Eligible employee" is an individual who was a Member before the first Plan Year beginning after December 31, 1995.

3.  All funds of the Firefighters' Pension Plan may be deposited by the Board with the Finance Director of the City, acting in a ministerial capacity only, who shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as he is liable for the safekeeping of funds for the City. However, any funds so deposited with the Finance Director of the City shall be kept in a separate fund by the Finance Director or clearly identified as such funds of the Firefighters' Pension Plan. In lieu thereof, the Board shall deposit the funds of the Firefighters' Pension Plan in a qualified public depository as defined in §280.02, Florida Statutes, which depository with regard to such funds shall conform to and be bound by all of the provisions of Chapter 280, Florida Statutes. In order to fulfill its investment responsibilities as set forth herein, the Board may retain the services of a custodian bank, an investment advisor registered under Investment Advisors Act of 1940 or otherwise exempt from such required registration, an insurance company, or a combination of these, for the purposes of investment decisions and management. Such investment manager shall have discretion, subject to any guidelines as prescribed by the Board, in the investment of all Fund assets. 
4.  All funds and securities of the System may be commingled in the Fund, provided that accurate records are maintained at all times reflecting the financial composition of the Fund, including accurate current accounts and entries as regards the following: 
A.  Current amounts of Accumulated Contributions of Members on both an individual and aggregate account basis, and 
B.  Receipts and disbursements, and 
C.  Benefit payments, and 
D.  Current amounts clearly reflecting all monies, funds and assets whatsoever attributable to contributions and deposits from the City, and 
E.  All interest, dividends and gains (or losses) whatsoever, and 
F.  Such other entries as may be properly required so as to reflect a clear and complete financial report of the Fund. 
5.  An audit shall be performed annually by a certified public accountant for the most recent fiscal year of the System showing a detailed listing of assets and a statement of all income and disbursements during the year. Such income and disbursements must be reconciled with the assets at the beginning and end of the year. Such report shall reflect a complete evaluation of assets on both a cost and market basis, as well as other items normally included in a certified audit. 
6.  The Board shall have the following investment powers and authority: 
A.  The Board shall be vested with full legal title to said Fund, subject, however, and in any event to the authority and power of the Winter Park City Commission to amend or terminate this Fund, provided that no amendment or Fund termination shall ever result in the use of any assets of this Fund except for the payment of regular expenses and benefits under this System, except as otherwise provided herein. All contributions from time to time paid into the Fund, and the income thereof, without distinction between principal and income, shall be held and administered by the Board or its agent in the Fund and the Board shall not be required to segregate or invest separately any portion of the Fund. 
B.  All monies paid into or held in the Fund shall be invested and reinvested by the Board and the investment of all or any part of such funds shall be subject to the following: 
(1)  Notwithstanding any limitation provided for in Chapter 175, Florida Statutes to the contrary (unless such limitation may not be amended by local ordinance) or any limitation in prior city ordinances to the contrary, all monies paid into or held in the Fund may be invested and reinvested in such securities, investment vehicles or property wherever situated and of whatever kind, as shall be approved by the Board, including but not limited to common or preferred stocks, bonds, and other evidences of indebtedness or ownership. In no event, however, shall more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the assets of the Fund at market value be invested in foreign securities. 
(2)  The Board shall develop and adopt a written investment policy statement setting forth permissible types of investments, goals and objectives of investments and setting quality and quantity limitations on investments in accordance with the recommendations of its investment consultants. The investment policy statement shall be reviewed by the Board at least annually. 
(3)  In addition, the Board may, upon recommendation by the Board's investment consultant, make investments in group trusts meeting the requirements of Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 81-100 and Revenue Ruling 2011-1, IRS Notice 2012-6 and Revenue Ruling 2014-24 or successor rulings or guidance of similar import, and operated or maintained exclusively for the commingling and collective investment of monies, provided that the funds in the group trust consist exclusively of trust assets held under plans qualified under section 401(a) of the Code, individual retirement accounts that are exempt under section 408(e) of the Code, eligible governmental plans that meet the requirements of section 457(b) of the Code, and governmental plans under 401(a)(24) of the Code. For this purpose, a trust includes a custodial account or a separate tax favored account maintained by an insurance company that is treated as a trust under section 401(f) or under section 457(g)(3) of the Code. While any portion of the assets of the fund are invested in such a group trust, such group trust is itself adopted as a part of the System or plan. 
(a)  Any collective or common group trust to which assets of the fund are transferred pursuant to subsection (3) shall be adopted by the board as part of the plan by executing appropriate participation, adoption agreements, and/or trust agreements with the group trust's trustee. 
(b)  The separate account maintained by the group trust for the plan pursuant to subsection (3) shall not be used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than for the exclusive benefit of the members and beneficiaries of the plan. 
(c)  For purposes of valuation, the value of the separate account maintained by the group trust for the plan shall be the fair market value of the portion of the group trust held for the plan, determined in accordance with generally recognized valuation procedures. 
C.  At least once every three (3) years, and more often as determined by the Board, the Board shall retain a professionally qualified independent consultant, as defined in Section 175.071, Florida Statutes, to evaluate the performance of all current investment managers and make recommendations regarding the retention of all such investment managers. These recommendations shall be considered by the Board at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
D.  The Board may retain in cash and keep unproductive of income such amount of the Fund as it may deem advisable, having regard for the cash requirements of the System. 
E.  Neither the Board nor any Trustee shall be liable for the making, retention or sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of the Fund, except that due to his or its own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. 
F.  The Board may cause any investment in securities held by it to be registered in or transferred into its name as Trustee or into the name of such nominee as it may direct, or it may retain them unregistered and in form permitting transferability, but the books and records shall at all times show that all investments are part of the Fund. 
G.  The Board is empowered, but is not required, to vote upon any stocks, bonds, or securities of any corporation, association, or trust and to give general or specific proxies or powers of attorney with or without power of substitution; to participate in mergers, reorganizations, recapitalizations, consolidations, and similar transactions with respect to such securities; to deposit such stock or other securities in any voting trust or any protective or like committee with the Trustees or with depositories designated thereby; to amortize or fail to amortize any part or all of the premium or discount resulting from the acquisition or disposition of assets; and generally to exercise any of the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, or other investments comprising the Fund which it may deem to be to the best interest of the Fund to exercise. 
H.  The Board shall not be required to make any inventory or appraisal or report to any court, nor to secure any order of court for the exercise of any power contained herein. 
I.  Where any action which the Board is required to take or any duty or function which it is required to perform either under the terms herein or under the general law applicable to it as Trustee under this ordinance, can reasonably be taken or performed only after receipt by it from a Member, the City, or any other entity, of specific information, certification, direction or instructions, the Board shall be free of liability in failing to take such action or perform such duty or function until such information, certification, direction or instruction has been received by it. 
J.  Any overpayments or underpayments from the Fund to a Member, Retiree or Beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate per annum approved by the Board in such a manner that the Actuarial Equivalent of the benefit to which the Member, Retiree or Beneficiary was correctly entitled, shall be paid. Overpayments shall be charged against payments next succeeding the correction or collected in another manner if prudent. Underpayments shall be made up from the Fund in a prudent manner. 
K.  The Board shall sustain no liability whatsoever for the sufficiency of the Fund to meet the payments and benefits provided for herein. 
L.  In any application to or proceeding or action in the courts, only the Board shall be a necessary party, and no Member or other person having an interest in the Fund shall be entitled to any notice or service of process. Any judgment entered in such a proceeding or action shall be conclusive upon all persons. 
M.  Any of the foregoing powers and functions reposed in the Board may be performed or carried out by the Board through duly authorized agents, provided that the Board at all times maintains continuous supervision over the acts of any such agent; provided further, that legal title to said Fund shall always remain in the Board.

A.  Amount. Each Member of the System shall be required to make regular contributions to the Fund in the amount of six percent (6%) of his Salary. Member contributions withheld by the City on behalf of the Member shall be deposited with the Board immediately after each pay period. The contributions made by each Member to the Fund shall be designated as employer contributions pursuant to §414(h) of the Code. Such designation is contingent upon the contributions being excluded from the Members' gross income for Federal Income Tax purposes. For all other purposes of the System, such contributions shall be considered to be Member contributions. 
B.  Method. Such contributions shall be made by payroll deduction. 
2.  State Contributions. Any monies received or receivable by reason of laws of the State of Florida, for the express purpose of funding and paying for retirement benefits for Firefighters of the City shall be deposited in the Fund comprising part of this System immediately and under no circumstances more than five (5) days after receipt by the City. In accordance with the August 30, 2012, letter from the Florida Department of Management Services, all Chapter 175 premium tax revenues received through September 30, 2018, shall be used to offset the City's annual contribution to the Fund. Effective October 1, 2018, as mutually agreed by the City and the Firefighters' Union, the statutory default provisions for the use of Chapter 175 premium tax revenues in Section 175.351. F.S. shall be applied. Effective October 1, 2018, one-half of the accumulated premium tax revenues as of September 30, 2012, ($102,055.50) shall be used to pay down the unfunded liability, and one-half of the accumulated premium tax revenues as of September 30, 2012, ($102,055.50) shall be used to fund the share plan as provided in Section 74-180. Effective October 1, 2018, all annual premium tax revenues up to the 2012 amount ($385,648.00) shall be used to offset the City's annual contribution to the Fund, and premium tax revenues in excess of $385,648.00 shall be used as follows: one-half of the excess shall be used to offset the City's annual contribution to the Fund, and one-half of the excess shall be used to fund the share plan, as provided in Section 74-180. 
3.  City Contributions. So long as this System is in effect, the City shall make quarterly contributions to the Fund in an amount equal to the required City contribution, as shown by the applicable actuarial valuation of the System. 
4.  Other. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the Fund, but such deposits must be accounted for separately and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis. Funds arising from these sources may be used only for additional benefits for Members, as determined by the Board, and may not be used to reduce what would have otherwise been required City contributions.

Sec. 74-157. - Pre-retirement death. 
1.  Prior to Vesting or Eligibility for Retirement. The Beneficiary of a deceased Member who was not receiving monthly benefits or who was not yet vested or eligible for early or normal retirement and who did not die as a direct result of the performance of his duties as a firefighter, shall receive a refund of one hundred percent (100%) of the Member's Accumulated Contributions. 
2.  Deceased Members Vested or Eligible for Retirement; Death In-Line of Duty. The Beneficiary of any Member who dies and who, at the date of his death was vested or eligible for early or normal retirement, or who dies as a direct result of his duties as a firefighter, shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
A.  With Non-Spouse Beneficiary. 
(1)  This subsection 2.A. applies only when the Member's Spouse is not the Beneficiary or is not the sole designated Beneficiary, but there is a surviving Beneficiary. If the Member was vested, but not eligible for normal or early retirement, the Beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased Member's Credited Service and Average Final Compensation as of the date of his death. The Beneficiary shall receive an immediate benefit, payable for ten (10) years, which is actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the early retirement date. 
(2)  If the deceased Member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the Beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for life determined as if the Member had retired the day before his death and elected the one hundred percent (100%) Joint and Survivor benefit. 
(3)  A Beneficiary may elect to receive an actuarial equivalent life benefit and the Board may elect to make a lump sum payment pursuant to Section 74-160. subsection 7. 
(4)  A Beneficiary may, in lieu of any benefit provided for in (1) or (2) above, elect to receive a refund of the deceased Member's Accumulated Contributions. 
(5)  If a surviving Beneficiary commences receiving a benefit under subsection (1) or (2) above, but dies before all payments are made, the actuarial value of the remaining benefit will be paid to the surviving Beneficiary's estate by December 31 of the calendar year of the Beneficiary's death in a lump sum. 
(6)  If there is no surviving Beneficiary as of the Member's death, and the estate is to receive the benefits, the actuarial equivalent of the Member's entire interest must be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Member's death. 
(7)  The Uniform Lifetime Table in Treasury Regulations § 1.401(a)(9)-9 shall determine the payment period for the calendar year benefits commence, if necessary to satisfy the regulations. 
B.  This subsection 2.B. applies only when the Member's Spouse is the sole designated Beneficiary. 
(1)  If the Member was vested, but not eligible for normal or early retirement, the Spouse Beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years, beginning on the date that the deceased Member would have been eligible for early or normal retirement, at the option of the Spouse Beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased Member's Credited Service and Average Final Compensation as of the date of his death and reduced as for early retirement, if applicable. The Spouse Beneficiary may also elect to receive an immediate benefit, payable for ten (10) years, which is actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the early retirement date. 
(2)  If the deceased Member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the Spouse Beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for life determined as if the Member had retired the day before his death and elected the one hundred percent (100%) Joint and Survivor benefit. 
(3)  In the event the Member dies as a direct result of the performance of his duties as a Firefighter, (1) and (2) above shall not apply and the Spouse Beneficiary shall receive a life benefit equal to the greater of i) thirty percent (30%) of the average monthly Salary of the Member over the previous twelve (12) month period, or ii) the Member's unreduced accrued benefit. 
(4)  A Spouse Beneficiary may not elect an optional form of benefit, however the Board may elect to make a lump sum payment pursuant to Section 74-160, subsection 7. 
(5)  A Spouse Beneficiary may, in lieu of any benefit provided for in (1) above, elect to receive a refund of the deceased Member's Accumulated Contributions. 
3.  The board shall determine whether death occurred as a direct result of the performance of duties as a firefighter and the In-Line of Duty Presumptions in Section 74-158, subsection 2, shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 2787-09, § 1, 11-23-09; Ord. No. 3092-17 , § 5, 12-11-17; Ord. No. 3120-18 , § 2, 8-27-18) 
Sec. 74-158. - Disability. 
1.  Disability Benefits In-Line of Duty. Any Member who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a Firefighter, which disability was directly caused by the performance of his duty as a Firefighter, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the Board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to three percent (3%) of his Average Final Compensation multiplied by the total years of Credited Service, but in any event, the minimum amount paid to the Member shall be forty-two percent (42%) of the Average Final Compensation of the Member. Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a Member is terminated by the City for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the Board within thirty (30) days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the Board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
2.  In-Line of Duty Presumptions. 
A.  Presumption. Any condition or impairment of health of a Member caused by hypertension or heart disease shall be presumed to have been suffered in line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence, provided that such Member shall have successfully passed a physical examination upon entering into such service, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of such condition; and provided further, that such presumption shall not apply to benefits payable or granted in a policy of life insurance or disability insurance. 
B.  Additional Presumption. The presumption provided for in this subparagraph B. shall apply only to those conditions described in this subparagraph B. that are diagnosed on or after January 1, 1996. 
(1)  Definitions. As used in this subsection 2.B., the following definitions apply: 
(a)  "Body fluids" means blood and body fluids containing visible blood and other body fluids to which universal precautions for prevention of occupational transmission of blood-borne pathogens, as established by the Centers for Disease Control, apply. For purposes of potential transmission of meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis, the term "body fluids" includes respiratory, salivary, and sinus fluids, including droplets, sputum, and saliva, mucous, and other fluids through which infectious airborne organisms can be transmitted between persons. 
(b)  "Emergency rescue or public safety Member" means any Member employed full time by the City as a firefighter, paramedic, emergency medical technician, law enforcement officer, or correctional officer who, in the course of employment, runs a high risk of occupational exposure to hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis and who is not employed elsewhere in a similar capacity. However, the term "emergency rescue or public safety Member" does not include any person employed by a public hospital licensed under Chapter 395, Florida Statutes, or any person employed by a subsidiary thereof. 
(c)  "Hepatitis" means hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis non-A, hepatitis non-B, hepatitis C, or any other strain of hepatitis generally recognized by the medical community. 
(d)  "High risk of occupational exposure" means that risk that is incurred because a person subject to the provisions of this subsection, in performing the basic duties associated with his employment: 
i.  Provides emergency medical treatment in a non-health-care setting where there is a potential for transfer of body fluids between persons; 
ii.  At the site of an accident, fire, or other rescue or public safety operation, or in an emergency rescue or public safety vehicle, handles body fluids in or out of containers or works with or otherwise handles needles or other sharp instruments exposed to body fluids; 
iii.  Engages in the pursuit, apprehension, and arrest of law violators or suspected law violators and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids; or 
iv.  Is responsible for the custody, and physical restraint when necessary, of prisoners or inmates within a prison, jail, or other criminal detention facility, while on work detail outside the facility, or while being transported and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids. 
(e)  "Occupational exposure," in the case of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, means an exposure that occurs during the performance of job duties that may place a worker at risk of infection. 
(2)  Presumption. Any emergency rescue or public safety Member who suffers a condition or impairment of health that is caused by hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, that requires medical treatment, and that results in total or partial disability or death shall be presumed to have a disability suffered in the line of duty, unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence; however, in order to be entitled to the presumption, the Member must, by written affidavit as provided in Section 92.50, Florida Statutes, verify by written declaration that, to the best of his knowledge and belief: 
(a)  In the case of a medical condition caused by or derived from hepatitis, he has not: 
i.  Been exposed, through transfer of bodily fluids, to any person known to have sickness or medical conditions derived from hepatitis, outside the scope of his employment; 
ii.  Had a transfusion of blood or blood components, other than a transfusion arising out of an accident or injury happening in connection with his present employment, or received any blood products for the treatment of a coagulation disorder since last undergoing medical tests for hepatitis, which tests failed to indicate the presence of hepatitis; 
iii.  Engaged in unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior, as identified by the Centers for Disease Control or the Surgeon General of the United States or had sexual relations with a person known to him to have engaged in such unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior; or 
iv.  Used intravenous drugs not prescribed by a physician. 
(b)  In the case of meningococcal meningitis, in the ten (10) days immediately preceding diagnosis he was not exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known to have meningococcal meningitis or known to be an asymptomatic carrier of the disease. 
(c)  In the case of tuberculosis, in the period of time since the Member's last negative tuberculosis skin test, he has not been exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known by him to have tuberculosis. 
(3)  Immunization. Whenever any standard, medically recognized vaccine or other form of immunization or prophylaxis exists for the prevention of a communicable disease for which a presumption is granted under this section, if medically indicated in the given circumstances pursuant to immunization policies established by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Public Health Service, an emergency rescue or public safety Member may be required by the City to undergo the immunization or prophylaxis unless the Member's physician determines in writing that the immunization or other prophylaxis would pose a significant risk to the Member's health. Absent such written declaration, failure or refusal by an emergency rescue or public safety Member to undergo such immunization or prophylaxis disqualifies the Member from the benefits of the presumption. 
(4)  Record of Exposures. The City shall maintain a record of any known or reasonably suspected exposure of an emergency rescue or public safety Member in its employ to the disease described in this section and shall immediately notify the Member of such exposure. An emergency rescue or public safety Member shall file an incident or accident report with the City of each instance of known or suspected occupational exposure to hepatitis infection, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis. 
(5)  Required medical tests; preemployment physical. In order to be entitled to the presumption provided by this section: 
(a)  An emergency rescue or public safety Member must, prior to diagnosis, have undergone standard, medically acceptable tests for evidence of the communicable disease for which the presumption is sought, or evidence of medical conditions derived therefrom, which tests fail to indicate the presence of infection. This paragraph does not apply in the case of meningococcal meningitis. 
(b)  On or after June 15, 1995, an emergency rescue or public safety Member may be required to undergo a preemployment physical examination that tests for and fails to reveal any evidence of hepatitis or tuberculosis. 
3.  Disability Benefits Not-in-Line of Duty. Any Member with ten (10) years or more Credited Service who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a Firefighter, which disability is not directly caused by the performance of his duties as a Firefighter shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the Board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to three percent (3%) of his Average Final Compensation multiplied by the total years of Credited Service. Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a Member is terminated by the City for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the Board within thirty (30) days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the Board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
4.  Conditions Disqualifying Disability Benefits. Each Member who is claiming disability shall establish, to the satisfaction of the Board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
A.  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or narcotics. 
B.  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections or while committing a crime. 
C.  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the Armed Forces. 
D.  Injury or disease sustained after his employment as a Firefighter with the City of Winter Park shall have terminated. 
5.  Physical Examination Requirement. A Member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons, who shall be selected by the Board for that purpose. The Board shall not select the Member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose except in an unusual case where the Board determines it would be reasonable and prudent to do so. 
    Any Retiree receiving disability benefits under provisions of this ordinance may be required by the Board to submit sworn statements of his condition accompanied by a physician's statement (provided at the Retiree's expense) to the Board annually and may be required by the Board to undergo additional periodic re-examinations by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons who shall be selected by the Board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the Board finds that the Retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a Firefighter, the Board shall recommend to the City that the Retiree be returned to performance of duty as a Firefighter, and the Retiree so returned shall enjoy the same rights that he had at the time he was placed upon pension. In the event the Retiree so ordered to return shall refuse to comply with the order within thirty (30) days from the issuance thereof, he shall forfeit the right to his pension. 
    The cost of the physical examination and/or re-examination of the Member claiming or the Retiree receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the Fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by the Board incident to the physical examination, such as, but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the Fund. 
    If the Retiree recovers from disability and reenters the service of the City as a Firefighter, his service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he reentered the service of the City will not be considered as Credited Service for the purposes of the System. 
    The Board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability claims. 
6.  Disability Payment. The monthly benefit to which a Member is entitled in the event of the Member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the Board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the Board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be: 
A.  If the Retiree recovers from the disability, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery, or 
B.  If the Retiree dies without recovering from disability, the payment due next preceding his death or the 120th monthly payment, whichever is later. 
    Provided, however, the disability Retiree may select, at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in Section 74-160, subsection 1.A. or 1.B., which shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the normal form of benefit. 
(Ord. No. 2787-09, § 1, 11-23-09; Ord. No. 3092-17 , § 6, 12-11-17) 
Sec. 74-159. - Vesting. 
    If a Member terminates his employment as a Firefighter, either voluntarily or by discharge, and is not eligible for any other benefits under this System, Member shall be entitled to the following: 
1.  If the Member has less than ten (10) years of Credited Service upon termination, the Member shall be entitled to a refund of his Accumulated Contributions or the Member may leave it deposited with the Fund. 
2.  If the Member has ten (10) or more years of Credited Service upon termination, the Member shall be entitled to a monthly retirement benefit, determined in the same manner as for normal or early retirement and based upon the Member's Credited Service, Average Final Compensation and the benefit accrual rate as of the date of termination, payable to him commencing at the Member's otherwise normal or early retirement date, determined as if he had remained employed, provided he does not elect to withdraw his Accumulated Contributions and provided the Member survives to his otherwise early or normal retirement date. If the Member does not withdraw his Accumulated Contributions and does not survive to his otherwise early or normal retirement date, his designated Beneficiary shall be entitled to a benefit as provided herein for a deceased Member, who has ten (10) or more years of Credited Service and who dies from a condition that was not-in-line of duty as provided under Pre-Retirement Death. 
(Ord. No. 2787-09, § 1, 11-23-09; Ord. No. 2906-13 , § 3, 1-28-13; Ord. No. 3092-17 , § 7, 12-11-17; Ord. No. 3120-18 , § 3, 8-27-18) 
Sec. 74-160. - Optional forms of benefits. 
1.  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early retirement as specified herein, a Member, upon written request to the Board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one (1) of the following options: 
A.  A retirement income of a monthly amount, payable to the Retiree for his lifetime only. 
B.  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the Retiree during the lifetime of the Retiree and following the death of the Retiree, one hundred percent (100%), seventy-five percent (75%), sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3 %), or fifty percent (50%) of such monthly amount payable to a joint pensioner for his lifetime. Except where the Retiree's joint pensioner is his spouse, the payments to the joint pensioner as a percentage of the payments to the Retiree shall not exceed the applicable percentage provided for in the applicable table in the Treasury regulations. (See Q & A-2 of 1.401(a)(9)-6) 
C.  If a Member retires prior to the time at which Social Security benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as Social Security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of Retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the System, based upon the Social Security law in effect at the time of the Member's Retirement. 
D.  For any Member who does not participate in the DROP pursuant to Section 74-176, a lump sum payment payable to the Retiree equal to twenty percent (20%) of the actuarial equivalent present value of the Retiree's accrued benefit at the date of retirement with the remaining eighty percent (80%) payable to the Retiree in a form selected by the Retiree and provided for in A. or B. above or in the normal form (ten (10) year certain and life). A Retiree who is a participant in the Deferred Retirement Option Plan shall not be eligible to select this partial lump sum option. 
2.  The Member, upon electing any option of this Section, will designate the joint pensioner (subsection 1.B., above) or Beneficiary (or Beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the System in the event of Member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one (1) or more primary Beneficiaries where applicable. A Member may change his Beneficiary at any time. If a Member has elected an option with a joint pensioner and the Member's retirement income benefits have commenced, the Member may thereafter change his designated Beneficiary at any time, but may only change his joint pensioner twice. Subject to the restriction in the previous sentence, a Member may substitute a new joint pensioner for a deceased joint pensioner. In the absence of proof of good health of the joint pensioner being replaced, the actuary will assume that the joint pensioner has deceased for purposes of calculating the new payment. 
3.  The consent of a Member's or Retiree's joint pensioner or Beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously-designated Beneficiaries to receive benefits under the System shall thereupon cease. 
4.  Upon change of a Retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this Section, the amount of the retirement income payable to the Retiree shall be actuarially redetermined to take into account the age of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the Retiree and to ensure that the benefit paid is the Actuarial Equivalent of the present value of the Retiree's then current benefit at the time of the change. Any such Retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the Board and on completion will be filed with the Board. In the event that no designated Beneficiary survives the Retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the Retiree subsequent to his Retirement shall be paid as provided in Section 74-161. 
5.  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this Section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
A.  If a Member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under Section 74-157. 
B.  If the designated Beneficiary (or Beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the Member's Retirement under the System, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the Member upon his Retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this Section or a new Beneficiary is designated by the Member prior to his Retirement. 
C.  If both the Retiree and the Beneficiary (or Beneficiaries) designated by Member or Retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection 1, the Board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with Section 74-161. 
D.  If a Member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of Section 74-156, subsection 1, and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this Section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a Beneficiary (or Beneficiaries) designated by the Member in the amount or amounts computed as if the Member had retired under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
E.  The Member's benefit under this Section must begin to be distributed to the Member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the Member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the Member terminates employment with the City. 
6.  A Retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
7.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Board in its discretion, may elect to make a lump sum payment to a Member or a Member's Beneficiary in the event that the total commuted value of the monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the Board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the System with regard to such Member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(Ord. No. 2787-09, § 1, 11-23-09; Ord. No. 3092-17 , § 8, 12-11-17) 
Sec. 74-161. - Beneficiaries. 
1.  Each Member or Retiree may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the Board, designate a Beneficiary (or Beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the event of his death. Each designation may be revoked or changed by such Member or Retiree by signing and filing with the Board a new designation-of-beneficiary form. Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated Beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the System shall cease. 
2.  If a deceased Member or Retiree failed to name a Beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection 1, or if the Beneficiary (or Beneficiaries) named by a deceased Member or Retiree predeceases the Member or Retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the System with respect to such deceased Member or Retiree shall be paid to the estate of the Member or Retiree and the Board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum. 
3.  Any payment made to any person pursuant to this Section shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the System with regard to the deceased Member and any other persons with rights under the System and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 2787-09, § 1, 11-23-09) 
Sec. 74-162. - Claims procedures. 
1.  The Board shall establish administrative claims procedures to be utilized in processing written requests ("claims"), on matters which affect the substantial rights of any person ("Claimant"), including Members, Retirees, Beneficiaries, or any person affected by a decision of the Board. 
2.  The Board shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents for discovery prior to and at any proceedings provided for in the Board's claims procedures. The Claimant may request in writing the issuance of subpoenas by the Board. A reasonable fee may be charged for the issuance of any subpoenas not to exceed the fees set forth in Florida Statutes. 
(Ord. No. 2787-09, § 1, 11-23-09) 
Sec. 74-163. - Reports to Division of Retirement. 
    Each year and no later than March 15th, the Board shall file an Annual Report with the Division of Retirement containing the documents and information required by Section 175.261, Florida Statutes. 
(Ord. No. 2787-09, § 1, 11-23-09) 
Sec. 74-164. - Roster of Retirees. 
    The Secretary of the Board shall keep a record of all persons enjoying a pension under the provisions of this ordinance in which it shall be noted the time when the pension is allowed and when the same shall cease to be paid. Additionally, the Secretary shall keep a record of all Members in such a manner as to show the name, address, date of employment and date of termination of employment. 
(Ord. No. 2787-09, § 1, 11-23-09) 
Sec. 74-165. - Maximum pension. 
1.  Basic Limitation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this System to the contrary, the Member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the System shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of Code Section 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in Code Section 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) ($160,000.00), subject to the applicable adjustments in Code Section 415(b) and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this System. For purposes of this Section, "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
    For purposes of Code Section 415(b), the "annual benefit" means a benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) without regard to the benefit attributable to after-tax employee contributions (except pursuant to Code Section 415(n) and to rollover contributions (as defined in Code Section 415(b)(2)(A)). The "benefit attributable" shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations. 
2.  Adjustments to Basic Limitation for Form of Benefit. If the benefit under the plan is other than the annual benefit described in subsection 1., then the benefit shall be adjusted so that it is the equivalent of the annual benefit, using factors prescribed in Treasury Regulations. If the form of the benefit without regard to any automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity or a qualified joint and survivor annuity, then the preceding sentence is applied by either reducing the Code Section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date or adjusting the form of benefit to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the additional benefits under the form of benefit as follows: 
A.  For a benefit paid in a form to which Section 417(e)(3) of the Code does not apply (generally, a monthly benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greater of: 
(1)  The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the Member under the Plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit to the Member, or

C.  The actuary may adjust the 415(b) limit at the annuity starting date in accordance with subsections A. and B. above. 
3.  Benefits Not Taken into Account. For purposes of this Section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
A.  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
B.  Any other benefit not required under § 415(b)(2) of the Code and Regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of Code Section 415(b)(1); and 
C.  That portion of any joint and survivor annuity that constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity. 
4.  COLA Effect. Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b) (the "Limit"), the following will apply: 
A.  A Member's applicable limit will be applied to the Member's annual benefit in the Member's first limitation year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
B.  Thereafter, in any subsequent limitation year, a Member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under Code Section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
C.  In no event shall a Member's benefit payable under the System in any limitation year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code Section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
    Unless otherwise specified in the System, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b), a Member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost of living increases as required by Section 415(b) of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations. 
5.  Other Adjustments in Limitations. 
A.  In the event the Member's retirement benefits become payable before age sixty-two (62), the limit prescribed by this Section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of Code Section 415(b) of the Code, so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a one hundred sixty thousand dollar ($160,000.00) annual benefit beginning at age sixty-two (62). 
B.  In the event the Member's benefit is based on at least fifteen (15) years of Credited Service as a full-time employee of the police or fire department of the City, the adjustments provided for in A. above shall not apply. 
C.  The reductions provided for in A. above shall not be applicable to disability benefits pursuant to Section 74-158, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to Section 74-157. 
D.  In the event the Member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age sixty-five (65), for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection 1 herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age sixty-five (65). This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. 
6.  Less than Ten (10) Years of Participation. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this Section to any Member who has completed less than ten (10) years of participation shall be the amount determined under subsection 1 of this Section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the Member's years of participation and the denominator of which is ten (10). The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below 10% of the limit determined without regard to this subsection. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to pre-retirement disability benefits paid pursuant to Section 74-158, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to Section 74-157. 
7.  Participation in Other Defined Benefit Plans. The limit of this Section with respect to any Member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in Code Section 414(j) maintained by the City shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all City defined benefit plans in which the Member has been a member were payable from one plan. 
8.  Ten Thousand Dollar ($10,000.00) Limit; Less Than Ten Years of Service. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 74-165, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a Member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this subsection 8. of Section 74-165 if the benefits payable, with respect to such Member under this System and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the City contributes, do not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) for the applicable limitation year or for any prior limitation year, and the City has not at any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the Member participated; provided, however, that if the Member has completed less than ten (10) years of Credited Service with the City, the limit under this subsection 8. of Section 74-165 shall be a reduced limit equal to ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the Member's years of Credited Service and the denominator of which is ten (10). 
9.  Reduction of Benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the Member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which Member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which Member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the Board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the Member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which Member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the Board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the Board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such Member. 
10.  Service Credit Purchase Limits. 
A.  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a Member makes one or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the System, as allowed in Section 74-177 and 74-178, then the requirements of this Section will be treated as met only if: 
(1)  The requirements of Code Section 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of Code Section 415(b), or 
(2)  The requirements of Code Section 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of Code Section 415(c). 
For purposes of applying subparagraph (1), the System will not fail to meet the reduced limit under Code Section 415(b)(2)(c) solely by reason of this subparagraph , and for purposes of applying subparagraph (2) the System will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under Section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Code solely by reason of this subparagraph. 
B.  For purposes of this subsection the term "permissive service credit" means service credit- 
(1)  Recognized by the System for purposes of calculating a Member's benefit under the plan, 
(2)  Which such Member has not received under the plan, and 
(3)  Which such Member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the System, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the System, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding clause B.(2), may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a Member is receiving under the System. 
11.  Contributions Limits. 
A.  For purposes of applying the Code Section 415(c) limits which are incorporated by reference and for purposes of this subsection 11., only and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable will be compensation actually paid or made available during a limitation year, except as noted below and as permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the System, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of Code Section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under Code Sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052 and will be determined without regard to any rules under Code Section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code Section 3401(a)(2). 
(1)  However, for limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under Code Sections 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b). For limitation years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of Code Section 132(f)(4). 
(2)  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the limitation year will also include compensation paid by the later of 21/2 months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
(a)  The payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
(b)  The payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
(3)  Back pay, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this definition. 
B.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the Board may modify a request by a Member to make a contribution to the System if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in Code Section 415 by using the following methods: 
(1)  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the Board may establish a periodic payment deduction plan for the Member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under Code Sections 415(c) or 415(n). 
(2)  If payment pursuant to subparagraph (1) will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by Code Section 415(c), the Board may either reduce the Member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the Member's contribution. 
C.  If the annual additions for any Member for a limitation year exceed the limitation under Section 415(c) of the Code, the excess annual addition will be corrected as permitted under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (or similar IRS correction program). 
D.  For limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, a Member's compensation for purposes of this subsection 11. shall not exceed the annual limit under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code. 
12.  Additional Limitation on Pension Benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
A.  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a Retiree shall not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of his Average Final Compensation. However, nothing contained in this Section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
B.  No Member of the System shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the Member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to social security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 1223, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
13.  Effect of Direct Rollover on 415(b) Limit. If the plan accepts a direct rollover of an employee's or former employee's benefit from a defined contribution plan qualified under Code Section 401(a) which is maintained by the employer, any annuity resulting from the rollover amount that is determined using a more favorable actuarial basis than required under Code Section 417(e) shall be included in the annual benefit for purposes of the limit under Code Section 415(b). 
(Ord. No. 2787-09, § 1, 11-23-09; Ord. No. 2934-13, § 3, 8-26-13; Ord. No. 3092-17 , § 9, 12-11-17) 
Sec. 74-166. - Distribution of benefits. 
1.  General Rules. 
A.  Effective Date. Effective as of January 1, 1989, the Plan will pay all benefits in accordance with a good faith interpretation of the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations in effect under that section, as applicable to a governmental plan within the meaning of Code Section 414(d). Effective on and after January 1, 2003, the Plan is also subject to the specific provisions contained in this Section. The provisions of this Section will apply for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for calendar years beginning with the 2003 calendar year. 
B.  Precedence. The requirements of this Section will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the Plan. 
C.  TEFRA Section 242(b)(2) Elections. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section other than this subsection 1.C., distributions may be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, in accordance with Section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) and the provisions of the plan that related to Section 242(b)(2) of TEFRA. 
2.  Time and Manner of Distribution. 
A.  Required Beginning Date. The Member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the Member no later than the Member's required beginning date which shall not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the Member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the Member terminates employment with the City. 
B.  Death of Member Before Distributions Begin. If the Member dies before distributions begin, the Member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than as follows: 
(1)  If the Member's surviving spouse is the Member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Member died, or by a date on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the Member would have attained age seventy and one-half (701/2), if later, as the surviving spouse elects. 
(2)  If the Member's surviving spouse is not the Member's sole designated beneficiary, then, distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Member died. 
(3)  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the Member's death, the Member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Member's death. 
(4)  If the Member's surviving spouse is the Member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the Member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection 2.B., other than subsection 2.B.(1), will apply as if the surviving spouse were the Member. 
For purposes of this subsection 2.B., distributions are considered to begin on the Member's required beginning date or, if subsection 2.B.(4) applies, the date of distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection 2.B.(1). If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the Member before the Member's required beginning date (or to the Member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection 2.B.(1)), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
C.  Death After Distributions Begin. If the Member dies after the required distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the Member's interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution before the Member's death. 
D.  Form of Distribution. Unless the Member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with this Section. If the Member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury regulations. Any part of the Member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in Section 414(k) of the Code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
3.  Determination of Amount to be Distributed Each Year. 
A.  General Requirements. If the Member's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the Plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
(1)  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one (1) year. 
(2)  The Member's entire interest must be distributed pursuant to Section 74-156, Section 74-157, Section 74-159, or Section 74-160 (as applicable) and in any event over a period equal to or less than the Member's life or the lives of the Member and a designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the Member or of the Member and a designated beneficiary. The life expectancy of the Member, the Member's spouse, or the Member's beneficiary may not be recalculated after the initial determination for purposes of determining benefits. 
B.  Amount Required to be Distributed by Required Beginning Date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the Member's required beginning date (or, if the Member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under Section 74-157) is the payment that is required for one (1) payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., monthly. All of the Member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments. 
C.  Additional Accruals After First Distribution Calendar Year. Any additional benefits accruing to the Member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
4.  General Distribution Rules. 
A.  The amount of an annuity paid to a Member's beneficiary may not exceed the maximum determined under the incidental death benefit requirement of Code Section 401(a)(9)(G), and effective for any annuity commencing on or after January 1, 2008, the minimum distribution incidental benefit rule under Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(a)(9)-6, Q&A-2. 
B.  The death and disability benefits provided by the Plan are limited by the incidental benefit rule set forth in Code Section 401(a)(9)(G) and Treasury Regulation Section 1.401-1(b)(1)(I) or any successor regulation thereto. As a result, the total death or disability benefits payable may not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the cost for all of the Members' benefits received from the retirement system. 
5.  Definitions. 
A.  Designated Beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the Plan and is the designated beneficiary under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4, of the Treasury regulations. 
B.  Distribution Calendar Year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the Member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the Member's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the Member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to Section 74-157.

1.  Interest of Members in System. All assets of the Fund are held in trust, and at no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the System with respect to Retirees and Members and their Spouses or Beneficiaries, shall any part of the corpus or income of the Fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit. 
2.  No Reduction of Accrued Benefit. No amendment or ordinance shall be adopted by the City Commission of the City of Winter Park which shall have the effect of reducing the then vested accrued benefits of Members or a Member's Beneficiaries.

It is intended that the System will constitute a qualified public pension plan under the applicable provisions of the Code for a qualified plan under Code Section 401(a) and a governmental plan under Code Section 414(d), as now in effect or hereafter amended. Any modification or amendment of the System may be made retroactively, if necessary or appropriate, to qualify or maintain the System as a Plan meeting the requirements of the applicable provisions of the Code as now in effect or hereafter amended, or any other applicable provisions of the U.S. federal tax laws, as now in effect or hereafter amended or adopted, and the regulations issued thereunder. 
4.  Use of Forfeitures. Forfeitures arising from terminations of service of Members shall serve only to reduce future City contributions.

6.  USERRA. Effective December 12, 1994, notwithstanding any other provision of this System, contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military service are governed by Code Section 414(u) and the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, as amended. To the extent that the definition of "Credited Service" sets forth contribution requirements that are more favorable to the Member than the minimum compliance requirements, the more favorable provisions shall apply. 
7.  Vesting. 
A.  Member will be one hundred percent (100%) vested in all benefits upon attainment of the Plan's age and service requirements for the Plan's normal retirement benefit; and

However, where applicable, the Board shall comply with Treas. Reg. § 1.401(a)-21. 
9.  Compliance with Chapter 175, Florida Statutes. It is intended that the System will continue to qualify for funding under Section 175.101, Florida Statutes. Accordingly, unless otherwise required by law, any provision of the System which would disqualify the System from funding under Section 175.101, Florida Statutes, as amended from time to time, shall be superseded by and administered in accordance with the requirements of such chapter applicable to local law plans. 
(Ord. No. 2787-09, § 1, 11-23-09) 
Sec. 74-168. - Repeal or termination of system. 
1.  The ordinance establishing the System and Fund, and subsequent ordinances pertaining to said System and Fund, may be modified, terminated, or amended, in whole or in part; provided that if this or any subsequent ordinance shall be amended or repealed in its application to any person benefiting hereunder, the amount of benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment, or repeal shall have accrued to the Member or Beneficiary shall not be affected thereby. 
2.  If this ordinance shall be repealed, or if contributions to the System are discontinued or if there is a transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions as provided in Chapter 121, Florida Statutes, the Board shall continue to administer the System in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance, for the sole benefit of the then Members, any Beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one (1) of the options provided for in this division who are designated by any of said Members. In the event of repeal, discontinuance of contributions, or transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions, there shall be full vesting one hundred percent (100%) of benefits accrued to date of repeal and such benefits shall be nonforfeitable. 
3.  The fund shall be distributed in accordance with the following procedures: 
A.  The Board shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value required to fund all the nonforfeitable benefits after taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The Board shall inform the City if additional assets are required, in which event the City shall continue to financially support the Plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded. 
B.  The Board shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or otherwise, for each Firefighter entitled to benefits under the plan as specified in subsection C. 
C.  The Board shall distribute the asset value as of the date of termination in the manner set forth in this subsection, on the basis that the amount required to provide any given retirement income is the actuarially computed single-sum value of such retirement income, except that if the method of distribution determined under subsection B. involves the purchase of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given retirement income is the single premium payable for such annuity. The actuarial single-sum value may not be less than the Firefighter's Accumulated Contributions to the Plan, with interest if provided by the Plan, less the value of any plan benefits previously paid to the Firefighter. 
D.  If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection C., and after the payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the City, less return to the State of the State's contributions, provided that, if the excess is less than the total contributions made by the City and the State to date of termination of the Plan, such excess shall be divided proportionately to the total contributions made by the City and the State. 
E.  The Board shall distribute, in accordance with subsection B., the amounts determined under subsection C. 
If, after twenty-four (24) months after the date the Plan terminated or the date the Board received written notice that the contributions thereunder were being permanently discontinued, the City or the Board of the Fund affected has not complied with all the provisions in this Section, the Florida Department of Management Services will effect the termination of the Fund in accordance with this Section.

1.  Domestic Relations Orders. 
A.  Prior to the entry of any domestic relations order which affects or purports to affect the System's responsibility in connection with the payment of benefits of a Retiree, the Member or Retiree shall submit the proposed order to the Board for review to determine whether the System may legally honor the order. 
B.  If a domestic relations order is not submitted to the Board for review prior to entry of the order, and the System is ordered to take action that it may not legally take, and the System expends administrative or legal fees in resolving the matter, the Member or Retiree who submits such an order will be required to reimburse the System for its expenses in connection with the order. 
2.  Retiree Directed Payments. The Board may, upon written request by a Retiree or by a dependent, when authorized by a Retiree or the Retiree's Beneficiary, authorize the System to withhold from the monthly retirement payment those funds that are necessary to pay for the benefits being received through the City, to pay the certified bargaining agent of the City, to make payments to insurance companies for insurance premiums, as permitted by Chapter 175, Florida Statutes, and to make any payments for child support or alimony. 
3.  Exemption from Execution, Non-Assignability. Except as otherwise provided by law, the pensions, annuities, or any other benefits accrued or accruing to any person under the provisions of this ordinance and the Accumulated Contributions and the cash securities in the Fund created under this ordinance are hereby exempted from any state, county or municipal tax of the state and shall not be subject to execution, attachment, garnishment or any legal process whatsoever and shall be unassignable.

Sec. 74-174. - Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions; elimination of mandatory distributions. 
1.  Rollover Distributions. 
A.  General. This Section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the System to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this Section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
B.  Definitions. 
(1)  Eligible Rollover Distribution: An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include the following: (i) any distribution that is one (1) of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated Beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; (ii) any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code; and (iii) the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income. Effective January 1, 2002, any portion of any distribution which would be includible in gross income as after-tax employee contributions will be an eligible rollover distribution if the distribution is made to an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a); to an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b); to a qualified defined contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible; or on or after January 1, 2007, to a qualified defined benefit plan described in Code Section 401(a) or to an annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b), that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not so includible. 
(2)  Eligible Retirement Plan: An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code; an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code; an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code, effective January 1, 2002, an eligible deferred compensation plan described in Section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by an eligible employer described in Section 457(e)(1)(A) of the Code and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan; effective January 1, 2002, an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code; a qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the Code; or effective January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described in Section 408A of the Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. This definition shall also apply in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving Spouse. 
(3)  Distributee: A distributee includes an employee or former employee. It also includes the employee's or former employee's surviving Spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse. Effective January 1, 2007, it further includes a nonspouse beneficiary who is a designated beneficiary as defined by Code Section 401(a)(9)(E). However, a nonspouse beneficiary may rollover the distribution only to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving the distribution and the account or annuity will be treated as an "inherited" individual retirement account or annuity. 
(4)  Direct Rollover: A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
2.  Rollovers or Transfers into the Fund. On or after January 1, 2002, the System will accept, solely for the purpose of purchasing Credited Service as provided herein, permissible Member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans, Member rollover cash contributions and/or direct cash rollovers of distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, as follows: 
A.  Transfers and Direct Rollovers or Member Rollover Contributions from Other Plans. The System will accept either a direct rollover of an eligible rollover distribution or a Member contribution of an eligible rollover distribution from a qualified plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code, from an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Code or from an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state. The System will also accept legally permissible Member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans. 
B.  Member Rollover Contributions from IRAs. The system will accept a Member rollover contribution of the portion of a distribution from an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or 408(b) of the Code that is eligible to be rolled over. 
3.  Elimination of Mandatory Distributions. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event this Plan provides for a mandatory (involuntary) cash distribution from the Plan not otherwise required by law, for an amount in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), such distribution shall be made from the Plan only upon written request of the Member and completion by the Member of a written election on forms designated by the Board, to either receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount. 
(Ord. No. 2787-09, § 1, 11-23-09) 
Sec. 74-175. - Family and Medical Leave Act. 
    The fractional parts of the twelve (12) month period ending each March 1 that a Member is on leave without pay from the City pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), 29 U.S.C. §2611 et seq., shall be added to his Credited Service provided that: 
1.  The Member contributes to the Fund (i) the sum that he would have contributed, based on his Salary and the Member contribution rate in effect at the time that the Credited Service is requested, had he been a Member of the System for the fractional parts of the twelve (12) month period ending each March 1 for which he is requesting credit, plus (ii) an amount actuarially determined (using the actuarial assumptions that are used by this plan for purposes of its annual actuarial valuation) such that the crediting of service does not result in any cost to the Fund, plus (iii) payment of fees for all professional services rendered to the Board in connection with the Member's purchase of periods of Credited Service. 
2.  Credited Service shall not be issued unless (i) prior to that March 1, the Member files a written request for Credited Service for FMLA leave time during the twelve (12) month period that ends on that March 1; (ii) on or before the next following March 31, the Member pays the fees for professional services described above, and (iii) on or before the next following April 30, the Member pays, in one (1) lump sum, the sum described above and the actuarially determined amount described above. Credited Service shall not be issued until such payment is received. 
3.  Credited Service purchased pursuant to this Section shall count as Credited Service for all purposes of this System, including vesting and eligibility for retirement.

C.  "Total Return of the Assets" - For purposes of calculating earnings on a Member's DROP Account pursuant to subsection 3.B.(2)(b). for each fiscal year quarter, the percentage increase (or decrease) in the interest and dividends earned on investments, including realized and unrealized gains (or losses), of the total Plan assets. 
2.  Participation. 
A.  Eligibility to Participate. In lieu of terminating his employment as a Firefighter, any Member who is eligible for normal retirement under the System may elect to defer receipt of such service retirement pension and to participate in the DROP. 
B.  Election to Participate. A Member's election to participate in the DROP must be made in writing in a time and manner determined by the Board and shall be effective on the first day of the first calendar month which is at least fifteen (15) business days after it is received by the Board. 
C.  Period of Participation. A Member who elects to participate in the DROP under subsection 2.B., shall participate in the DROP for a period not to exceed eighty-four (84) months beginning at the time his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. An person who is currently in the DROP on the effective date of the ordinance extending the permissible DROP period provided for in this paragraph may extend his DROP participation as provided herein. An election to participate in the DROP shall constitute an irrevocable election to resign from the service of the City not later than the date provided for in the previous sentence. A Member may participate only once. 
D.  Termination of Participation. 
(1)  A Member's participation in the DROP shall cease at the earlier of: 
(a)  The end of his permissible period of participation in the DROP as determined under subsection 2.C.; or 
(b)  Termination of his employment as a Firefighter. 
(2)  Upon the Member's termination of participation in the DROP pursuant to subsection (1)(a) above, all amounts provided for in subsection 3.B., including monthly benefits and investment earnings and losses or interest, shall cease to be transferred from the System to his DROP Account. Any amounts remaining in his DROP Account shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of subsection 4. when he terminates his employment as a Firefighter. 
(3)  A Member who terminates his participation in the DROP under this subsection 2.D. shall not be permitted to again become a participant in the DROP. 
E.  Effect of DROP Participation on the System. 
(1)  A Member's Credited Service and his accrued benefit under the System shall be determined on the date his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. The Member shall not accrue any additional Credited Service or any additional benefits under the System (except for any supplemental benefit payable to DROP participants or any additional benefits provided under any cost-of-living adjustment for Retirees in the System) while he is a participant in the DROP. After a Member commences participation, he shall not be permitted to again contribute to the System nor shall he be eligible for disability or pre-retirement death benefits, except as provided for in Section 74-179, Reemployment After Retirement. 
(2)  No amounts shall be paid to a Member from the System while the Member is a participant in the DROP. Unless otherwise specified in the System, if a Member's participation in the DROP is terminated other than by terminating his employment as a Firefighter, no amounts shall be paid to him from the System until he terminates his employment as a Firefighter. Unless otherwise specified in the System, amounts transferred from the System to the Member's DROP Account shall be paid directly to the member only upon the termination of his employment as a Firefighter. 
3.  Funding. 
A.  Establishment of DROP Account. A DROP Account shall be established for each Member participating in the DROP. A Member's DROP Account shall consist of amounts transferred to the DROP under subsection 3.B., and earnings or interest on those amounts. 
B.  Transfers From Retirement System. 
(1)  As of the first day of each month of a Member's period of participation in the DROP, the monthly retirement benefit he would have received under the System had he terminated his employment as a Firefighter and elected to receive monthly benefit payments thereunder shall be transferred to his DROP Account, except as otherwise provided for in subsection 2.D.(2). A Member's period of participation in the DROP shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of subsections 2.C. and 2.D., but in no event shall it continue past the date he terminates his employment as a Firefighter. 
(2)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2.D.(2), a Member's DROP Account under this subsection 3.B. shall be debited or credited with either: 
(a)  Interest at an effective rate of six and one-half percent (61/2%) per annum compounded monthly determined on the last business day of the prior month's ending balance and credited to the Member's DROP Account as of such date (to be applicable to all current and future DROP participants): or 
(b)  Earnings, to be credited or debited to the Member's DROP Account, determined as of the last business day of each fiscal year quarter and debited or credited as of such date, determined as follows: 
The average daily balance in a Member's DROP Account shall be credited or debited at a rate equal to the net investment return realized by the System for that quarter. "Net investment return" for the purpose of this paragraph is the total return of the assets in which the Member's DROP Account is invested by the Board net of brokerage commissions, management fees and transaction costs. 
For purposes of calculating earnings on a Member's DROP Account pursuant to this subsection 3.B.(2)(b), brokerage commissions, transaction costs, and management fees shall be determined for each quarter by the investment consultant pursuant to contracts with fund managers as reported in the custodial statement. The investment consultant shall report these quarterly contractual fees to the Board. The investment consultant shall also report the net investment return for each manager and the net investment return for the total Plan assets. 
Upon electing participation in the DROP, the Member shall elect to receive either interest or earnings on his account to be determined as provided above. The Member may, in writing, elect to change his election only once during his DROP participation. An election to change must be made prior to the end of a quarter and shall be effective beginning the following quarter. This amendment to subsection 3.B.(2) shall apply to both current and future DROP participants. 
(3)  A Member's DROP Account shall only be credited or debited with earnings or interest and monthly benefits while the Member is a participant in the DROP. A Member's final DROP account value for distribution to the Member upon termination of participation in the DROP shall be the value of the account at the end of the quarter immediately preceding termination of participation for participants electing the net plan return and at the end of the month immediately preceding termination of participation for participants electing the flat interest rate return plus any monthly periodic additions made to the DROP account subsequent to the end of the previous quarter or month, as applicable, and prior to distribution. If a Member fails to terminate employment after participating in the DROP for the permissible period of DROP participation, then beginning with the Member's first month of employment following the last month of the permissible period of DROP participation, the Member's DROP Account will no longer be credited or debited with earnings or interest, nor will monthly benefits be transferred to the DROP account. All such non-transferred amounts shall be forfeited and continue to be forfeited while the Member is employed by the Fire Department, and no cost-of-living adjustments shall be applied to the Member's credit during such period of continued employment. A Member employed by the Fire Department after the permissible period of DROP participation will be eligible for pre-retirement death and disability benefits, and will accrue additional Credited Service or benefits only as provided for in Section 74-179. 
4.  Distribution of Drop Accounts on Termination of Employment. 
A.  Eligibility for Benefits. A Member shall receive the balance in his DROP Account in accordance with the provisions of this subsection 4. upon his termination of employment as a Firefighter. Except as provided in subsection 4.E., no amounts shall be paid to a Member from the DROP prior to his termination of employment as a Firefighter. 
B.  Form of Distribution. 
(1)  Distribution of the Member's DROP Account shall be made in a cash lump sum subject to the direct rollover provisions set forth in subsection 4.F. Elections under this paragraph shall be in writing and shall be made in such time or manner as the Board shall determine. 
(2)  Notwithstanding the preceding, if a Member dies before his benefit is paid, his DROP Account shall be paid to his Beneficiary in such optional form as his Beneficiary may select. If no Beneficiary designation is made, the DROP Account shall be distributed to the Member's estate. 
C.  Date of Payment of Distribution. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection 4., distribution of a Member's DROP Account shall be made as soon as administratively practicable following the Member's termination of employment. Distribution of the amount in a Member's DROP account will not be made unless the Member completes a written request for distribution and a written election, on forms designated by the Board, to either receive a cash lump sum or a rollover of the lump sum amount. 
D.  Proof of Death and Right of Beneficiary or Other Person. The Board may require and rely upon such proof of death and such evidence of the right of any Beneficiary or other person to receive the value of a deceased Member's DROP Account as the Board may deem proper and its determination of the right of that Beneficiary or other person to receive payment shall be conclusive. 
E.  Distribution Limitation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection 4., all distributions from the DROP shall conform to the "Minimum Distribution Of Benefits" provisions as provided for herein. 
F.  Direct Rollover of Certain Distributions. This subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the DROP to the contrary, a distributee may elect to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid in a direct rollover as otherwise provided under the System in Section 74-174. 
5.  Administration of DROP. 
A.  Board Administers the DROP. The general administration of the DROP, the responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the DROP and the responsibility of overseeing the investment of the DROP's assets shall be placed in the Board. The Members of the Board may appoint from their number such subcommittees with such powers as they shall determine; may adopt such administrative procedures and regulations as they deem desirable for the conduct of their affairs; may authorize one (1) or more of their number or any agent to execute or deliver any instrument or make any payment on their behalf; may retain counsel, employ agents and provide for such clerical, accounting, actuarial and consulting services as they may require in carrying out the provisions of the DROP; and may allocate among themselves or delegate to other persons all or such portion of their duties under the DROP, other than those granted to them as trustee under any trust agreement adopted for use in implementing the DROP, as they, in their sole discretion, shall decide. A trustee shall not vote on any question relating exclusively to himself. 
B.  Individual Accounts, Records and Reports. The Board shall maintain records showing the operation and condition of the DROP, including records showing the individual balances in each Member's DROP Account, and the Board shall keep in convenient form such data as may be necessary for the valuation of the assets and liabilities of the DROP. The Board shall prepare and distribute to Members participating in the DROP and other individuals or file with the appropriate governmental agencies, as the case may be, all necessary descriptions, reports, information returns, and data required to be distributed or filed for the DROP pursuant to the Code and any other applicable laws. 
C.  Establishment of Rules. Subject to the limitations of the DROP, the Board from time to time shall establish rules for the administration of the DROP and the transaction of its business. The Board shall have discretionary authority to construe and interpret the DROP (including but not limited to determination of an individual's eligibility for DROP participation, the right and amount of any benefit payable under the DROP and the date on which any individual ceases to be a participant in the DROP). The determination of the Board as to the interpretation of the DROP or its determination of any disputed questions shall be conclusive and final to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
D.  Limitation of Liability. 
(1)  The trustees shall not incur any liability individually or on behalf of any other individuals for any act or failure to act, made in good faith in relation to the DROP or the funds of the DROP. 
(2)  Neither the Board nor any trustee of the Board shall be responsible for any reports furnished by any expert retained or employed by the Board, but they shall be entitled to rely thereon as well as on certificates furnished by an accountant or an actuary, and on all opinions of counsel. The Board shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in reliance upon such expert, accountant, actuary or counsel, and all actions taken or suffered in such reliance shall be conclusive upon any person with any interest in the DROP. 
E.  Expenses. To compensate the System for the expenses of administering and operating the DROP, each Member's DROP Account shall be charged an annual administrative fee which shall be reviewed and subject to increase or decrease annually. The initial expense charge of three-quarters of one percent (0.75%) of the account balance, shall be deducted from the Member's DROP Account after each fiscal year quarter at the rate of 0.1875% of the account's average daily balance during that quarter. 
6.  General Provisions. 
A.  The DROP Is Not a Separate Retirement Plan. Instead, it is a program under which a Member who is eligible for normal retirement under the System may elect to accrue future retirement benefits in the manner provided in this section 74-176 for the remainder of his employment, rather than in the normal manner provided under the plan. Under termination of employment, a Member is entitled to a lump sum distribution of his or her DROP Account balance or may elect a rollover. The DROP Account distribution is in addition to the Member's monthly benefit. 
B.  Notional Account. The DROP Account established for such a Member is a notional account, used only for the purpose of calculation of the DROP distribution amount. It is not a separate account in the System. There is no change in the System's assets, and there is no distribution available to the Member until the Member's termination from the DROP. The Member has no control over the investment of the DROP Account. 
C.  No Employer Discretion. The DROP benefit is determined pursuant to a specific formula which does not involve employer discretion. 
D.  IRC Limit. The DROP Account distribution, along with other benefits payable from the System, is subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b). 
E.  Amendment of DROP. The DROP may be amended by an ordinance of the City at any time and from time to time, and retroactively if deemed necessary or appropriate, to amend in whole or in part any or all of the provisions of the DROP. However, except as otherwise provided by law, no amendment shall make it possible for any part of the DROP's funds to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of persons entitled to benefits under the DROP. No amendment shall be made which has the effect of decreasing the balance of the DROP Account of any Member. 
F.  Facility of Payment. If a Member or other person entitled to a benefit under the DROP is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident or is a minor, the Board shall direct that any benefit due him shall be made only to a duly appointed legal representative. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of the liabilities of the DROP for that benefit. 
G.  Information. Each Member, Beneficiary or other person entitled to a benefit, before any benefit shall be payable to him or on his account under the DROP, shall file with the Board the information that it shall require to establish his rights and benefits under the DROP. 
H.  Prevention of Escheat. If the Board cannot ascertain the whereabouts of any person to whom a payment is due under the DROP, the Board may, no earlier than five (5) years from the date such payment is due, mail a notice of such due and owing payment to the last known address of such person, as shown on the records of the Board or the City. If such person has not made written claim therefor within three (3) months of the date of the mailing, the Board may, if it so elects and upon receiving advice from counsel to the DROP, direct that such payment and all remaining payments otherwise due such person be canceled on the records of the DROP. Upon such cancellation, the DROP shall have no further liability therefor except that, in the event such person or his Beneficiary later notifies the Board of his whereabouts and requests the payment or payments due to him under the DROP, the amount so applied shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of the DROP. 
I.  Written Elections, Notification. 
(1)  Any elections, notifications or designations made by a Member pursuant to the provisions of the DROP shall be made in writing and filed with the Board in a time and manner determined by the Board under rules uniformly applicable to all employees similarly situated. The Board reserves the right to change from time to time and manner for making notifications, elections or designations by Members under the DROP if it determines after due deliberation that such action is justified in that it improves the administration of the DROP. In the event of a conflict between the provisions for making an election, notification or designation set forth in the DROP and such new administrative procedures, those new administrative procedures shall prevail. 
(2)  Each Member or Retiree who has a DROP Account shall be responsible for furnishing the Board with his current address and any subsequent changes in his address. Any notice required to be given to a Member or Retiree hereunder shall be deemed given if directed to him at the last such address given to the Board and mailed by registered or certified United States mail. If any check mailed by registered or certified United States mail to such address is returned, mailing of checks will be suspended until such time as the Member or Retiree notifies the Board of his address. 
J.  Benefits Not Guaranteed. All benefits payable to a Member from the DROP shall be paid only from the assets of the Member's DROP Account and neither the City nor the Board shall have any duty or liability to furnish the DROP with any funds, securities or other assets except to the extent required by any applicable law. 
K.  Construction. 
(1)  The DROP shall be construed, regulated and administered under the laws of Florida, except where other applicable law controls. 
(2)  The titles and headings of the subsections in this Section 74-176 are for convenience only. In the case of ambiguity or inconsistency, the text rather than the titles or headings shall control. 
L.  Forfeiture of Retirement Benefits. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to remove DROP participants from the application of any forfeiture provisions applicable to the System. DROP participants shall be subject to forfeiture of all retirement benefits, including DROP benefits. 
M.  Effect of DROP Participation on Employment. Participation in the DROP is not a guarantee of employment and DROP participants shall be subject to the same employment standards and policies that are applicable to employees who are not DROP participants.

Sec. 74-179. - Reemployment after retirement. 
1.  Any Retiree under this System, except for disability retirement as previously provided for, may be reemployed by any public or private employer, except the City, and may receive compensation from that employment without limiting or restricting in any way the retirement benefits payable under this System. Reemployment by the City shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this Section. 
2.  After Normal Retirement. Any Retiree who is retired under normal (or early) retirement pursuant to this System and who is reemployed as a Firefighter and, by virtue of that reemployment, is eligible to participate in this System, shall upon being reemployed, discontinue receipt of benefits. Upon reemployment, the Member shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional Credited Service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final Retirement. Calculations of benefits upon Retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, Average Final Compensation, and Credited Service (and early retirement reduction factor, if applicable) as of that date and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, Average Final Compensation (based only on the subsequent employment period and not including any period of DROP participation), and Credited Service (and early retirement reduction factor, if applicable) as of the date of subsequent retirement. The amount of any death or disability benefit received during a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the Retiree may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable only to the subsequent retirement benefit. 
3.  Any Retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this System who is reemployed by the City in a position other than as a Firefighter, shall upon being reemployed, continue receipt of retirement benefits during any subsequent period of employment. Former DROP participants shall begin receipt of benefits under these circumstances.

If the reemployed person is not eligible to participate in this System, that person's pension benefit payments shall be suspended until the earlier of termination of employment or such time as the reemployed retiree reaches the date that he would have been eligible for normal retirement under this system had he continued employment and not elected early retirement. "Normal retirement" as used in this subsection shall be the current normal retirement date provided under this System. 
5.  Reemployment of Terminated Vested Persons. Reemployed terminated vested persons shall not be subject to the provisions of this Section until such time as they begin to actually receive benefits. Upon receipt of benefits, terminated vested persons shall be treated as normal or early Retirees for purposes of applying the provisions of this Section and their status as an early or normal Retiree shall be determined by the date they elect to begin to receive their benefit. 
6.  DROP Participants. Members or Retirees who are or were in the Deferred Retirement Option Plan shall, following termination of employment after DROP participation, have the options provided for in this Section for reemployment.

The investment consultant shall report these annual contractual fees to the board. The investment consultant shall also report the net investment return for each manager and the net investment return for the total plan assets. 
C.  Allocation of Costs, Fees and Expenses. On each valuation date, each individual share account shall be adjusted to allocate its pro rata share of the costs, fees and expenses of administration of the share plan. These fees shall be allocated to each individual Member share account on a proportionate basis taking the costs, fees and expenses of administration of the Share Plan as a whole multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total assets in each individual Member share account (after adding the annual investment gain or loss) and the denominator of which is the total assets of the fund as a whole as of the same date. 
D.  No Right to Allocation. The fact of allocation or credit of an allocation to a Member's share account by the Board shall not vest in any Member, any right, title, or interest in the assets of the trust or in the Chapter 175 tax revenues except at the time or times, to the extent, and subject to the terms and conditions provided in this Section. 
E.  Members shall be provided annual statements setting forth their share account balance as of the end of the Plan Year.

B.  Termination Benefit.

(2)  Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection 6. 
C.  Disability Benefit. 
(1)  In the event that a Member is determined to be eligible for either an in-line of duty disability benefit pursuant to Section 74-158, subsection 1, or a not-in-line of duty disability benefit pursuant to Section 74-158, subsection 3., he shall be entitled to one hundred percent (100%) of the value of his share account.

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, for Credited Service on and after October 1, 2011, Salary shall exclude payments for overtime in excess of three hundred (300) hours per calendar year and payments for accrued annual leave, except that payments for accrued annual leave accrued as of October 1, 2011 may be included in Salary for pension purposes even if payment is not actually made until on or after October 1, 2011 provided, however, the amount of accrued annual leave accrued as of October 1, 2011 that may be included in Salary for pension purposes shall be reduced by the actual amount of annual leave used by the Member on or after October 1, 2011 as follows: 
A.  For Members with sixteen (16) years or more Credited Service as of October 1, 2011, the amount of accrued annual leave included in Salary shall be calculated by reducing the amount of accrued annual leave as of October 1, 2011 by the actual amount of annual leave used by the Member on or after that date on a last in first out (LIFO) basis; and 
B.  For Members with less than sixteen (16) years of Credited Service as of October 1, 2011, the amount of annual leave included in Salary shall be calculated by reducing the amount of accrued annual leave as of October 1, 2011 by the actual amount of annual leave used by the Member on or after that date on a first in first out (FIFO) basis. 
    Compensation in excess of limitations set forth in Section 401(a)(17) of the Code as of the first day of the Plan Year shall be disregarded for any purpose, including employee contributions or any benefit calculations. The annual compensation of each member taken into account in determining benefits or employee contributions for any Plan Year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, may not exceed $200,000.00, as adjusted for cost-of-living increases in accordance with Code Section 401(a)(17)(B). Compensation means compensation during the fiscal year. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination period that begins with or within such calendar year. If the determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the annual compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period, and the denominator of which is 12. If the compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a Member's contributions or benefits for the current Plan Year, the compensation for such prior determination period is subject to the applicable annual compensation limit in effect for that prior period. The limitation on compensation for an "eligible employee" shall not be less than the amount which was allowed to be taken into account hereunder as in effect on July 1, 1993. "Eligible employee" is an individual who was a Member before the first Plan Year beginning after December 31, 1995.

The sole and exclusive administration of and responsibility for the proper operation of the System and for making effective the provisions of this ordinance is hereby vested in a Board of Trustees. The Board is hereby designated as the plan administrator. The Board shall consist of five (5) Trustees, two (2) of whom, unless otherwise prohibited by law, shall be legal residents of the City, who shall be appointed by the Winter Park City Commission, and two (2) of whom shall be full-time Members of the System, who shall be elected by a majority of the Police Officers who are Members of the System. The fifth Trustee shall be chosen by a majority of the previous four (4) Trustees as provided for herein, and such person's name shall be submitted to the Winter Park City Commission. Upon receipt of the fifth person's name, the Winter Park City Commission shall, as a ministerial duty, appoint such person to the Board as its fifth Trustee. The fifth Trustee shall have the same rights as each of the other four (4) Trustees appointed or elected as herein provided and shall serve a two (2) year term unless he sooner vacates the office. Each resident Trustee shall serve as Trustee for a period of two (2) years, unless he sooner vacates the office or is sooner replaced by the Winter Park City Commission at whose pleasure he shall serve. Each Member Trustee shall serve as Trustee for a period of two (2) years, unless he sooner leaves the employment of the City as a Police Officer or otherwise vacates his office as Trustee, whereupon a successor shall be chosen in the same manner as the departing Trustee. Each Trustee may succeed himself in office. DROP participants can be elected as but not vote for elected Trustees. The Board shall establish and administer the nominating and election procedures for each election. The Board shall meet at least quarterly each year. The Board shall be a legal entity with, in addition to other powers and responsibilities contained herein, the power to bring and defend lawsuits of every kind, nature, and description. 
2.  The Trustees shall, by a majority vote, elect a Chairman, Vice-Chairman and a Secretary. The Secretary of the Board shall keep a complete minute book of the actions, proceedings, or hearings of the Board. The Trustees shall not receive any compensation as such, but may receive expenses and per diem as provided by law. 
3.  Each Trustee shall be entitled to one (1) vote on the Board. Three (3) affirmative votes shall be necessary for any decision by the Trustees at any meeting of the Board. A Trustee shall abstain from voting as the result of a conflict of interest and shall comply with the provisions of Section 112.3143, Florida Statutes. 
4.  The Board shall engage such actuarial, accounting, legal, and other services as shall be required to transact the business of the System. The compensation of all persons engaged by the Board and all other expenses of the Board necessary for the operation of the System shall be paid from the Fund at such rates and in such amounts as the Board shall agree. In the event the Board chooses to use the City's legal counsel, actuary or other professional, technical or other advisors, it shall do so only under terms and conditions acceptable to the Board. 
5.  The duties and responsibilities of the Board shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following:

Sec. 74-204. - Finances and Fund management. 
    Establishment and Operation of Fund. 
1.  As part of the System, there exists the Fund, into which shall be deposited all of the contributions and assets whatsoever attributable to the System. 
2.  The actual custody and supervision of the Fund (and assets thereof) shall be vested in the Board. Payment of benefits and disbursements from the Fund shall be made by the disbursing agent but only upon written authorization from the Board. 
3.  All funds of the Police Officers' Pension Plan may be deposited by the Board with the Finance Director of the City, acting in a ministerial capacity only, who shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as he is liable for the safekeeping of funds for the City. However, any funds so deposited with the Finance Director of the City shall be kept in a separate fund by the Finance Director or clearly identified as such funds of the Police Officers' Pension Plan. In lieu thereof, the Board shall deposit the funds of the Police Officers' Pension Plan in a qualified public depository as defined in §280.02, Florida Statutes, which depository with regard to such funds shall conform to and be bound by all of the provisions of Chapter 280, Florida Statutes. In order to fulfill its investment responsibilities as set forth herein, the Board may retain the services of a custodian bank, an investment advisor registered under Investment Advisors Act of 1940 or otherwise exempt from such required registration, an insurance company, or a combination of these, for the purposes of investment decisions and management. Such investment manager shall have discretion, subject to any guidelines as prescribed by the Board, in the investment of all Fund assets. 
4.  All funds and securities of the System may be commingled in the Fund, provided that accurate records are maintained at all times reflecting the financial composition of the Fund, including accurate current accounts and entries as regards the following: 
A.  Current amounts of Accumulated Contributions of Members on both an individual and aggregate account basis, and 
B.  Receipts and disbursements, and 
C.  Benefit payments, and 
D.  Current amounts clearly reflecting all monies, funds and assets whatsoever attributable to contributions and deposits from the City, and 
E.  All interest, dividends and gains (or losses) whatsoever, and 
F.  Such other entries as may be properly required so as to reflect a clear and complete financial report of the Fund. 
5.  An audit shall be performed annually by a certified public accountant for the most recent fiscal year of the System showing a detailed listing of assets and a statement of all income and disbursements during the year. Such income and disbursements must be reconciled with the assets at the beginning and end of the year. Such report shall reflect a complete evaluation of assets on both a cost and market basis, as well as other items normally included in a certified audit. 
6.  The Board shall have the following investment powers and authority: 
A.  The Board shall be vested with full legal title to said Fund, subject, however, and in any event to the authority and power of the Winter Park City Commission to amend or terminate this Fund, provided that no amendment or Fund termination shall ever result in the use of any assets of this Fund except for the payment of regular expenses and benefits under this System, except as otherwise provided herein. All contributions from time to time paid into the Fund, and the income thereof, without distinction between principal and income, shall be held and administered by the Board or its agent in the Fund and the Board shall not be required to segregate or invest separately any portion of the Fund. 
B.  All monies paid into or held in the Fund shall be invested and reinvested by the Board and the investment of all or any part of such funds shall be subject to the following: 
(1)  Notwithstanding any limitation provided for in Chapter 185, Florida Statutes to the contrary (unless such limitation may not be amended by local ordinance) or any limitation in prior city ordinances to the contrary, all monies paid into or held in the Fund may be invested and reinvested in such securities, investment vehicles or property wherever situated and of whatever kind, as shall be approved by the Board, including but not limited to common or preferred stocks, bonds, and other evidences of indebtedness or ownership. In no event, however, shall more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the assets of the Fund at market value be invested in foreign securities. 
(2)  The Board shall develop and adopt a written investment policy statement setting forth permissible types of investments, goals and objectives of investments and setting quality and quantity limitations on investments in accordance with the recommendations of its investment consultants. The investment policy statement shall be reviewed by the Board at least annually. 
(3)  In addition, the Board may, upon recommendation by the Board's investment consultant, make investments in group trusts meeting the requirements of Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 81-100, Revenue Ruling 2011-1, IRS Notice 2012-6 and Revenue Ruling 2014-24 or successor rulings or guidance of similar import, and operated or maintained exclusively for the commingling and collective investment of monies, provided that the funds in the group trust consist exclusively of trust assets held under plans qualified under section 401(a) of the Code, individual retirement accounts that are exempt under section 408(e) of the Code, eligible governmental plans that meet the requirements of section 457(b) of the Code, and governmental plans under 401(a)(24) of the Code. For this purpose, a trust includes a custodial account or a separate tax favored account maintained by an insurance company that is treated as a trust under section 401(f) or under section 457(g)(3) of the Code. While any portion of the assets of the fund are invested in such a group trust, such group trust is itself adopted as a part of the System or plan. 
(a)  Any collective or common group trust to which assets of the fund are transferred pursuant to subsection (3) shall be adopted by the board as part of the plan by executing appropriate participation, adoption agreements, and/or trust agreements with the group trust's trustee. 
(b)  The separate account maintained by the group trust for the plan pursuant to subsection (3) shall not be used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than for the exclusive benefit of the members and beneficiaries of the plan. 
(c)  For purposes of valuation, the value of the separate account maintained by the group trust for the plan shall be the fair market value of the portion of the group trust held for the plan, determined in accordance with generally recognized valuation procedures. 
C.  At least once every three (3) years, and more often as determined by the Board, the Board shall retain a professionally qualified independent consultant, as defined in Section 185.06, Florida Statutes, to evaluate the performance of all current investment managers and make recommendations regarding the retention of all such investment managers. These recommendations shall be considered by the Board at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
D.  The Board may retain in cash and keep unproductive of income such amount of the Fund as it may deem advisable, having regard for the cash requirements of the System. 
E.  Neither the Board nor any Trustee shall be liable for the making, retention or sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of the Fund, except that due to his or its own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. 
F.  The Board may cause any investment in securities held by it to be registered in or transferred into its name as Trustee or into the name of such nominee as it may direct, or it may retain them unregistered and in form permitting transferability, but the books and records shall at all times show that all investments are part of the Fund. 
G.  The Board is empowered, but is not required, to vote upon any stocks, bonds, or securities of any corporation, association, or trust and to give general or specific proxies or powers of attorney with or without power of substitution; to participate in mergers, reorganizations, recapitalizations, consolidations, and similar transactions with respect to such securities; to deposit such stock or other securities in any voting trust or any protective or like committee with the Trustees or with depositories designated thereby; to amortize or fail to amortize any part or all of the premium or discount resulting from the acquisition or disposition of assets; and generally to exercise any of the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, or other investments comprising the Fund which it may deem to be to the best interest of the Fund to exercise. 
H.  The Board shall not be required to make any inventory or appraisal or report to any court, nor to secure any order of court for the exercise of any power contained herein. 
I.  Where any action which the Board is required to take or any duty or function which it is required to perform either under the terms herein or under the general law applicable to it as Trustee under this ordinance, can reasonably be taken or performed only after receipt by it from a Member, the City, or any other entity, of specific information, certification, direction or instructions, the Board shall be free of liability in failing to take such action or perform such duty or function until such information, certification, direction or instruction has been received by it. 
J.  Any overpayments or underpayments from the Fund to a Member, Retiree or Beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate per annum approved by the Board in such a manner that the Actuarial Equivalent of the benefit to which the Member, Retiree or Beneficiary was correctly entitled, shall be paid. Overpayments shall be charged against payments next succeeding the correction or collected in another manner if prudent. Underpayments shall be made up from the Fund in a prudent manner. 
K.  The Board shall sustain no liability whatsoever for the sufficiency of the Fund to meet the payments and benefits provided for herein. 
L.  In any application to or proceeding or action in the courts, only the Board shall be a necessary party, and no Member or other person having an interest in the Fund shall be entitled to any notice or service of process. Any judgment entered in such a proceeding or action shall be conclusive upon all persons. 
M.  Any of the foregoing powers and functions reposed in the Board may be performed or carried out by the Board through duly authorized agents, provided that the Board at all times maintains continuous supervision over the acts of any such agent; provided further, that legal title to said Fund shall always remain in the Board.

Sec. 74-205. - Contributions. 
1.  Member Contributions. 
A.  Amount. Each Member of the System shall be required to make regular contributions to the Fund in the amount of six percent (6%) of his Salary. Member contributions withheld by the City on behalf of the Member shall be deposited with the Board immediately after each pay period. The contributions made by each Member to the Fund shall be designated as employer contributions pursuant to §414(h) of the Code. Such designation is contingent upon the contributions being excluded from the Members' gross income for Federal Income Tax purposes. For all other purposes of the System, such contributions shall be considered to be Member contributions. 
B.  Method. Such contributions shall be made by payroll deduction. 
2.  State Contributions. Any monies received or receivable by reason of laws of the State of Florida, for the express purpose of funding and paying for retirement benefits for Police Officers of the City shall be deposited in the Fund comprising part of this System immediately and under no circumstances more than five (5) days after receipt by the City. 
3.  City Contributions. So long as this System is in effect, the City shall make quarterly contributions to the Fund in an amount equal to the required City contribution, as shown by the applicable actuarial valuation of the System. 
4.  Other. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the Fund, but such deposits must be accounted for separately and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis. Funds arising from these sources may be used only for additional benefits for Members, as determined by the Board, and may not be used to reduce what would have otherwise been required City contributions. 
(Ord. No. 2786-09, § 1, 11-23-09) 
Sec. 74-206. - Benefit amounts and eligibility.

4.  Early Retirement Benefit. A Member retiring hereunder on his early retirement date may receive either a deferred or an immediate monthly retirement benefit payable in the same form as for normal retirement as follows: 
A.  A deferred monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on what would have been his normal retirement date had he continued employment as a Police Officer and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The amount of each such deferred monthly retirement benefit shall be determined in the same manner as for retirement on his normal retirement date, except that Credited Service and Average Final Compensation shall be determined as of his early retirement date; or 
B.  An immediate monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on his early retirement date and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The benefit payable shall be as determined in paragraph A above, reduced by three percent (3%) for each year by which the commencement of benefits precedes the normal retirement date. 
5.  Cost-of-Living Adjustment.

Beginning on the first day of the month following the date on which a Retiree reaches age sixty (60), and annually on the same date in each subsequent year, the monthly benefit of each Retiree, Beneficiary, joint annuitant or terminated vested person who retires or otherwise terminates employment on or after the effective date of the ordinance adopting this subsection, shall be increased by three percent (3%). Beneficiaries and joint annuitants of deceased Retirees shall receive adjustments as provided for herein based on the age of the deceased Retiree.

Beginning October 1, 2003 and on each subsequent October 1st, the benefit recipients described in A. above shall, after receiving their first benefit increase on the first day of the month following their sixtieth birthday, receive their three percent (3%) annual adjustment on each October 1st thereafter. The October 1, 2003 increase for those currently receiving benefits, and the first October 1st following the sixtieth birthday increase, for those who begin benefits after October 1, 2003, shall be prorated according to the number of months since the immediately preceding increase was received. 
C.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection 5, Members who terminate City employment on or after March 1, 2013 for any reason, voluntary or involuntary, prior to attaining eligibility for normal or early retirement shall not be eligible for a cost of living adjustment pursuant to this subsection.

1.  Prior to Vesting or Eligibility for Retirement. The Beneficiary of a deceased Member who was not receiving monthly benefits or who was not yet vested or eligible for early or normal retirement and who did not die as a direct result of the performance of his duties as a police officer, shall receive a refund of one hundred percent (100%) of the Member's Accumulated Contributions. 
2.  Deceased Members Vested or Eligible for Retirement; Death In-Line of Duty. The Beneficiary of any Member who dies and who, at the date of his death was vested or eligible for early or normal retirement, or who dies as a direct result of his duties as a police officer, shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
A.  With Non-Spouse Beneficiary 
(1)  This subsection 2.A. applies only when the Member's Spouse is not the Beneficiary or is not the sole designated Beneficiary, but there is a surviving Beneficiary. If the Member was vested, but not eligible for normal or early retirement, the Beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased Member's Credited Service and Average Final Compensation as of the date of his death. The Beneficiary shall receive an immediate benefit, payable for ten (10) years, which is actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the early retirement date. 
(2)  If the deceased Member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the Beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for life determined as if the Member had retired the day before his death and elected the one hundred percent (100%) Joint and Survivor benefit. 
(3)  A Beneficiary may elect to receive an actuarial equivalent life benefit and the Board may elect to make a lump sum payment pursuant to Section 74-210, subsection 7. 
(4)  A Beneficiary may, in lieu of any benefit provided for in (1) or (2) above, elect to receive a refund of the deceased Member's Accumulated Contributions. 
(5)  If a surviving Beneficiary commences receiving a benefit under subsection (1) or (2) above, but dies before all payments are made, the actuarial value of the remaining benefit will be paid to the surviving Beneficiary's estate by December 31 of the calendar year of the Beneficiary's death in a lump sum. 
(6)  If there is no surviving Beneficiary as of the Member's death, and the estate is to receive the benefits, the actuarial equivalent of the Member's entire interest must be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Member's death. 
(7)  The Uniform Lifetime Table in Treasury Regulations § 1.401(a)(9)-9 shall determine the payment period for the calendar year benefits commence, if necessary to satisfy the regulations. 
B.  This subsection 2.B. applies only when the Member's Spouse is the sole designated Beneficiary. 
(1)  If the Member was vested, but not eligible for normal or early retirement, the Spouse Beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years, beginning on the date that the deceased Member would have been eligible for early or normal retirement, at the option of the Spouse Beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased Member's Credited Service and Average Final Compensation as of the date of his death and reduced as for early retirement, if applicable. The Spouse Beneficiary may also elect to receive an immediate benefit, payable for ten (10) years, which is actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the early retirement date. 
(2)  If the deceased Member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the Spouse Beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for life determined as if the Member had retired the day before his death and elected the one hundred percent (100%) Joint and Survivor benefit. 
(3)  In the event the Member dies as a direct result of the performance of his duties as a Police Officer, (1) and (2) above shall not apply and the Spouse Beneficiary shall receive a life benefit equal to the greater of i) thirty percent (30%) of the average monthly Salary of the Member over the previous twelve (12) month period, or ii) the Member's unreduced accrued benefit. 
(4)  A Spouse Beneficiary may not elect an optional form of benefit, however the Board may elect to make a lump sum payment pursuant to Section 10, subsection 7. 
(5)  A Spouse Beneficiary may, in lieu of any benefit provided for in (1) above, elect to receive a refund of the deceased Member's Accumulated Contributions. 
3.  The board shall determine whether death occurred as a direct result of the performance of duties as a police officer and the In-Line of Duty Presumptions in Section 74-208, subsection 2, shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 2786-09, § 1, 11-23-09; Ord. No. 3121-18 , § 2, 8-27-18) 
Sec. 74-208. - Disability. 
1.  Disability Benefits In-Line of Duty . Any Member who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a Police Officer, which disability was directly caused by the performance of his duty as a Police Officer, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the Board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to three percent (3%) of his Average Final Compensation multiplied by the total years of Credited Service, but in any event, the minimum amount paid to the Member shall be forty-two percent (42%) of the Average Final Compensation of the Member. Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a Member is terminated by the City for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the Board within thirty (30) days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the Board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
2.  In-Line of Duty Presumptions. 
A.  Presumption. Any condition or impairment of health of a Member caused by hypertension or heart disease shall be presumed to have been suffered in line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence, provided that such Member shall have successfully passed a physical examination upon entering into such service, including cardiogram, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of such condition; and provided further, that such presumption shall not apply to benefits payable or granted in a policy of life insurance or disability insurance. 
B.  Additional Presumption. The presumption provided for in this subparagraph B. shall apply only to those conditions described in this subparagraph B. that are diagnosed on or after January 1, 1996. 
(1)  Definitions. As used in this subsection 2.B., the following definitions apply: 
(a)  "Body fluids" means blood and body fluids containing visible blood and other body fluids to which universal precautions for prevention of occupational transmission of blood-borne pathogens, as established by the Centers for Disease Control, apply. For purposes of potential transmission of meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis, the term "body fluids" includes respiratory, salivary, and sinus fluids, including droplets, sputum, and saliva, mucous, and other fluids through which infectious airborne organisms can be transmitted between persons. 
(b)  "Emergency rescue or public safety Member" means any Member employed full time by the City as a firefighter, paramedic, emergency medical technician, law enforcement officer, or correctional officer who, in the course of employment, runs a high risk of occupational exposure to hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis and who is not employed elsewhere in a similar capacity. However, the term "emergency rescue or public safety Member" does not include any person employed by a public hospital licensed under Chapter 395, Florida Statutes, or any person employed by a subsidiary thereof. 
(c)  "Hepatitis" means hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis non-A, hepatitis non-B, hepatitis C, or any other strain of hepatitis generally recognized by the medical community. 
(d)  "High risk of occupational exposure" means that risk that is incurred because a person subject to the provisions of this subsection, in performing the basic duties associated with his employment: 
i.  Provides emergency medical treatment in a non-health-care setting where there is a potential for transfer of body fluids between persons; 
ii.  At the site of an accident, fire, or other rescue or public safety operation, or in an emergency rescue or public safety vehicle, handles body fluids in or out of containers or works with or otherwise handles needles or other sharp instruments exposed to body fluids; 
iii.  Engages in the pursuit, apprehension, and arrest of law violators or suspected law violators and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids; or 
iv.  Is responsible for the custody, and physical restraint when necessary, of prisoners or inmates within a prison, jail, or other criminal detention facility, while on work detail outside the facility, or while being transported and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids. 
(e)  "Occupational exposure," in the case of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, means an exposure that occurs during the performance of job duties that may place a worker at risk of infection. 
(2)  Presumption. Any emergency rescue or public safety Member who suffers a condition or impairment of health that is caused by hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, that requires medical treatment, and that results in total or partial disability or death shall be presumed to have a disability suffered in the line of duty, unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence; however, in order to be entitled to the presumption, the Member must, by written affidavit as provided in Section 92.50, Florida Statutes, verify by written declaration that, to the best of his knowledge and belief: 
(a)  In the case of a medical condition caused by or derived from hepatitis, he has not: 
i.  Been exposed, through transfer of bodily fluids, to any person known to have sickness or medical conditions derived from hepatitis, outside the scope of his employment; 
ii.  Had a transfusion of blood or blood components, other than a transfusion arising out of an accident or injury happening in connection with his present employment, or received any blood products for the treatment of a coagulation disorder since last undergoing medical tests for hepatitis, which tests failed to indicate the presence of hepatitis; 
iii.  Engaged in unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior, as identified by the Centers for Disease Control or the Surgeon General of the United States or had sexual relations with a person known to him to have engaged in such unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior; or 
iv.  Used intravenous drugs not prescribed by a physician. 
(b)  In the case of meningococcal meningitis, in the ten (10) days immediately preceding diagnosis he was not exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known to have meningococcal meningitis or known to be any asymptomatic carrier of the disease. 
(c)  In the case of tuberculosis, in the period of time since the Member's last negative tuberculosis skin test, he has not been exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known by him to have tuberculosis. 
(3)  Immunization. Whenever any standard, medically recognized vaccine or other form of immunization or prophylaxis exists for the prevention of a communicable disease for which a presumption is granted under this section, if medically indicated in the given circumstances pursuant to immunization policies established by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Public Health Service, an emergency rescue or public safety Member may be required by the City to undergo the immunization or prophylaxis unless the Member's physician determines in writing that the immunization or other prophylaxis would pose a significant risk to the Member's health. Absent such written declaration, failure or refusal by an emergency rescue or public safety Member to undergo such immunization or prophylaxis disqualifies the Member from the benefits of the presumption. 
(4)  Record of Exposures. The City shall maintain a record of any known or reasonably suspected exposure of an emergency rescue or public safety Member in its employ to the disease described in this section and shall immediately notify the Member of such exposure. An emergency rescue or public safety Member shall file an incident or accident report with the City of each instance of known or suspected occupational exposure to hepatitis infection, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis. 
(5)  Required medical tests; preemployment physical. In order to be entitled to the presumption provided by this section: 
(a)  An emergency rescue or public safety Member must, prior to diagnosis, have undergone standard, medically acceptable tests for evidence of the communicable disease for which the presumption is sought, or evidence of medical conditions derived therefrom, which tests fail to indicate the presence of infection. This paragraph does not apply in the case of meningococcal meningitis. 
(b)  On or after June 15, 1995, an emergency rescue or public safety Member may be required to undergo a preemployment physical examination that tests for and fails to reveal any evidence of hepatitis or tuberculosis. 
3.  Disability Benefits Not-in-Line of Duty . Any Member with ten (10) years or more Credited Service who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a Police Officer, which disability is not directly caused by the performance of his duties as a Police Officer shall upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the Board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to three percent (3%) of his Average Final Compensation multiplied by the total years of Credited Service. Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a Member is terminated by the City for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the Board within thirty (30) days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the Board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
4.  Conditions Disqualifying Disability Benefits. Each Member who is claiming disability shall establish, to the satisfaction of the Board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
A.  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or narcotics. 
B.  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections or while committing a crime. 
C.  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the Armed Forces. 
D.  Injury or disease sustained after his employment as a Police Officer with the City of Winter Park shall have terminated. 
E.  Injury or disease sustained by the Member while working for anyone other than the City and arising out of such employment, but injuries or disease sustained by a Member while performing special details approved by the City even though the cost of the special detail is paid by someone other than the City shall not be excluded. 
5.  Physical Examination Requirement. A Member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons, who shall be selected by the Board for that purpose. The Board shall not select the Member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose except in an unusual case where the Board determines it would be reasonable and prudent to do so. 
    Any Retiree receiving disability benefits under provisions of this ordinance may be required by the Board to submit sworn statements of his condition accompanied by a physician's statement (provided at the Retiree's expense) to the Board annually and may be required by the Board to undergo additional periodic re-examinations by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons who shall be selected by the Board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the Board finds that the Retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a Police Officer, the Board shall recommend to the City that the Retiree be returned to performance of duty as a Police Officer, and the Retiree so returned shall enjoy the same rights that he had at the time he was placed upon pension. In the event the Retiree so ordered to return shall refuse to comply with the order within thirty (30) days from the issuance thereof, he shall forfeit the right to his pension. 
    The cost of the physical examination and/or re-examination of the Member claiming or the Retiree receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the Fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by the Board incident to the physical examination, such as, but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the Fund. 
    If the Retiree recovers from disability and reenters the service of the City as a Police Officer, his service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he reentered the service of the City will not be considered as Credited Service for the purposes of the System. 
    The Board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability claims. 
6.  Disability Payment . The monthly benefit to which a Member is entitled in the event of the Member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the Board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the Board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be: 
A.  If the Retiree recovers from the disability, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery, or 
B.  If the Retiree dies without recovering from disability, the payment due next preceding his death or the 120th monthly payment, whichever is later. 
Provided, however, the disability Retiree may select, at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in Section 74-210, subsection 1.A. or 1.B., which shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the normal form of benefit. 
(Ord. No. 2786-09, § 1, 11-23-09; Ord. No. 3121-18 , § 3, 8-27-18) 
Sec. 74-209. - Vesting. 
    If a Member terminates his employment as a Police Officer, either voluntarily or by discharge, and is not eligible for any other benefits under this System, the Board shall be entitled to the following: 
1.  If the Member has less than ten (10) years of Credited Service upon termination, the Member shall be entitled to a refund of his Accumulated Contributions or the Member may leave it deposited with the Fund. 
2.  If the Member has ten (10) or more years of Credited Service upon termination, the Member shall be entitled to a monthly retirement benefit, determined in the same manner as for early or normal retirement and based upon the Member's Credited Service, Average Final Compensation and the benefit accrual rate as of the date of termination, payable to him commencing at the Member's otherwise early or normal retirement date, determined as if he had remained employed, provided he does not elect to withdraw his Accumulated Contributions and provided the Member survives to his otherwise early or normal retirement date. If the Member does not withdraw his Accumulated Contributions and does not survive to his otherwise early or normal retirement date, his designated Beneficiary shall be entitled to a benefit as provided herein for a deceased Member, who has ten (10) or more years of Credited Service and who dies from a condition that was not-in-line of duty as provided under Pre-Retirement Death. 
(Ord. No. 2786-09, § 1, 11-23-09; Ord. No. 2905-13 , § 3, 1-28-13; Ord. No. 3037-16 , § 5, 6-13-16; Ord. No. 3121-18 , § 4, 8-27-18) 
Sec. 74-210. - Optional forms of benefits. 
1.  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early retirement as specified herein, a Member, upon written request to the Board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one (1) of the following options: 
A.  A retirement income of a monthly amount, payable to the Retiree for his lifetime only. 
B.  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the Retiree during the lifetime of the Retiree and following the death of the Retiree, one hundred percent (100%), seventy-five percent (75%), sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3 %), or fifty percent (50%) of such monthly amount payable to a joint pensioner for his lifetime. Except where the Retiree's joint pensioner is his spouse, the payments to the joint pensioner as a percentage of the payments to the Retiree shall not exceed the applicable percentage provided for in the applicable table in the Treasury regulations. (See Q & A-2 of 1.401(a)(9)-6). 
C.  If a Member retires prior to the time at which Social Security benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as Social Security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of Retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the System, based upon the Social Security law in effect at the time of the Member's Retirement. 
D.  For any Member who does not participate in the DROP pursuant to Section 74-226, a lump sum payment payable to the Retiree equal to twenty percent (20%) of the actuarial equivalent present value of the Retiree's accrued benefit at the date of retirement with the remaining eighty percent (80%) payable to the Retiree in a form selected by the Retiree and provided for in A. or B. above or in the normal form (ten (10) year certain and life). A Retiree who is a participant in the Deferred Retirement Option Plan shall not be eligible to select this partial lump sum option. 
2.  The Member, upon electing any option of this Section, will designate the joint pensioner (subsection 1.B., above) or Beneficiary (or Beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the System in the event of Member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one (1) or more primary Beneficiaries where applicable. A Member may change his Beneficiary at any time. If a Member has elected an option with a joint pensioner and the Member's retirement income benefits have commenced, the Member may thereafter change his designated Beneficiary at any time, but may only change his joint pensioner twice. Subject to the restriction in the previous sentence, a Member may substitute a new joint pensioner for a deceased joint pensioner. In the absence of proof of good health of the joint pensioner being replaced, the actuary will assume that the joint pensioner has deceased for purposes of calculating the new payment. 
3.  The consent of a Member's or Retiree's joint pensioner or Beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously-designated Beneficiaries to receive benefits under the System shall thereupon cease. 
4.  Upon change of a Retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this Section, the amount of the retirement income payable to the Retiree shall be actuarially redetermined to take into account the age of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the Retiree and to ensure that the benefit paid is the Actuarial Equivalent of the present value of the Retiree's then current benefit at the time of the change. Any such Retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the Board and on completion will be filed with the Board. In the event that no designated Beneficiary survives the Retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the Retiree subsequent to his Retirement shall be paid as provided in Section 74-211. 
5.  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this Section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
A.  If a Member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under Section 74-207. 
B.  If the designated Beneficiary (or Beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the Member's Retirement under the System, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the Member upon his Retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this Section or a new Beneficiary is designated by the Member prior to his Retirement. 
C.  If both the Retiree and the Beneficiary (or Beneficiaries) designated by Member or Retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection 1, the Board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with Section 74-211. 
D.  If a Member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of Section 74-206, subsection 1, and dies prior to his actual Retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this Section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a Beneficiary (or Beneficiaries) designated by the Member in the amount or amounts computed as if the Member had retired under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
E.  The Member's benefit under this Section must begin to be distributed to the Member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the Member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the Member terminates employment with the City. 
6.  A Retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
7.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Board in its discretion, may elect to make a lump sum payment to a Member or a Member's Beneficiary in the event that the total commuted value of the monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the Board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the System with regard to such Member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(Ord. No. 2786-09, § 1, 11-23-09; Ord. No. 3037-16 , § 6, 6-13-16) 
Sec. 74-211. - Beneficiaries. 
1.  Each Member or Retiree may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the Board, designate a Beneficiary (or Beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the event of his death. Each designation may be revoked or changed by such Member or Retiree by signing and filing with the Board a new designation-of-beneficiary form. Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated Beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the System shall cease. 
2.  If a deceased Member or Retiree failed to name a Beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection 1, or if the Beneficiary (or Beneficiaries) named by a deceased Member or Retiree predeceases the Member or Retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the System with respect to such deceased Member or Retiree shall be paid to the estate of the Member or Retiree and the Board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum. 
3.  Any payment made to any person pursuant to this Section shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the System with regard to the deceased Member and any other persons with rights under the System and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 2786-09, § 1, 11-23-09) 
Sec. 74-212. - Claims procedures. 
1.  The Board shall establish administrative claims procedures to be utilized in processing written requests ("claims"), on matters which affect the substantial rights of any person ("Claimant"), including Members, Retirees, Beneficiaries, or any person affected by a decision of the Board. 
2.  The Board shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents for discovery prior to and at any proceedings provided for in the Board's claims procedures. The Claimant may request in writing the issuance of subpoenas by the Board. A reasonable fee may be charged for the issuance of any subpoenas not to exceed the fees set forth in Florida Statutes. 
(Ord. No. 2786-09, § 1, 11-23-09) 
Sec. 74-213. - Reports to division of retirement. 
    Each year and no later than March 15th, the Board shall file an Annual Report with the Division of Retirement containing the documents and information required by Section 185.221, Florida Statutes. 
(Ord. No. 2786-09, § 1, 11-23-09) 
Sec. 74-214. - Roster of retirees. 
    The Secretary of the Board shall keep a record of all persons enjoying a pension under the provisions of this ordinance in which it shall be noted the time when the pension is allowed and when the same shall cease to be paid. Additionally, the Secretary shall keep a record of all Members in such a manner as to show the name, address, date of employment and date of termination of employment. 
(Ord. No. 2786-09, § 1, 11-23-09) 
Sec. 74-215. - Maximum pension. 
1.  Basic Limitation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this System to the contrary, the Member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the System shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of Code Section 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in Code Section 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) ($160,000.00), subject to the applicable adjustments in Code Section 415(b) and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this System. For purposes of this Section, "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
    For purposes of Code Section 415(b), the "annual benefit" means a benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) without regard to the benefit attributable to after-tax employee contributions (except pursuant to Code Section 415(n) and to rollover contributions (as defined in Code Section 415(b)(2)(A)). The "benefit attributable" shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations. 
2.  Adjustments to Basic Limitation for Form of Benefit. If the benefit under the plan is other than the annual benefit described in subsection 1., then the benefit shall be adjusted so that it is the equivalent of the annual benefit, using factors prescribed in Treasury Regulations. If the form of the benefit without regard to any automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity or a qualified joint and survivor annuity, then the preceding sentence is applied by either reducing the Code Section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date or adjusting the form of benefit to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the additional benefits under the form of benefit as follows: 
A.  For a benefit paid in a form to which Section 417(e)(3) of the Code does not apply (generally, a monthly benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greater of: 
(1)  The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the Member under the Plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit to the Member, or 
(2)  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the Member, computed using a five percent (5%) interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Rulings 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code); or 
B.  For a benefit paid in a form to which Section 417(e)(3) of the Code applies (generally, a lump sum benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greatest of: 
(1)  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in the Plan for actuarial experience; 
(2)  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using a five and one half percent (5.5%) interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code); or 
(3)  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable (computed using the applicable interest rate for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) (the 30-year Treasury rate (prior to January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the month prior to retirement, and on and after January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the first day of the Plan Year with a one-year stabilization period)) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code), divided by 1.05. 
C.  The actuary may adjust the 415(b) limit at the annuity starting date in accordance with subsections A. and B. above. 
3.  Benefits Not Taken into Account. For purposes of this Section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
A.  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
B.  Any other benefit not required under §415(b)(2) of the Code and Regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of Code Section 415(b)(1); and 
C.  That portion of any joint and survivor annuity that constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity. 
4.  COLA Effect. Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b) (the "Limit"), the following will apply: 
A.  A Member's applicable limit will be applied to the Member's annual benefit in the Member's first limitation year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
B.  thereafter, in any subsequent limitation year, a Member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under Code Section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
C.  in no event shall a Member's benefit payable under the System in any limitation year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code Section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
    Unless otherwise specified in the System, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b), a Member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost of living increases as required by Section 415(b) of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations. 
5.  Other Adjustments in Limitations. 
A.  In the event the Member's retirement benefits become payable before age sixty-two (62), the limit prescribed by this Section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of Code Section 415(b) of the Code, so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a one hundred sixty thousand dollar ($160,000.00) annual benefit beginning at age sixty-two (62). 
B.  In the event the Member's benefit is based on at least fifteen (15) years of Credited Service as a full-time employee of the police or fire department of the City, the adjustments provided for in A. above shall not apply. 
C.  The reductions provided for in A. above shall not be applicable to disability benefits pursuant to Section 74-208, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to Section 74-207. 
D.  In the event the Member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age sixty-five (65), for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection 1 herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age sixty-five (65). This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. 
6.  Less Than Ten (10) Years of Participation . The maximum retirement benefits payable under this Section to any Member who has completed less than ten (10) years of participation with the City shall be the amount determined under subsection 1 of this Section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the Member's years of participation and the denominator of which is ten (10). The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below ten percent (10%) of the limit determined without regard to this subsection. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to disability benefits paid pursuant to Section 74-208, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to Section 74-207. 
7.  Participation in Other Defined Benefit Plans. The limit of this Section with respect to any Member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in Code Section 414(j) maintained by the City shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all City defined benefit plans in which the Member has been a member were payable from one plan. 
8.  Ten Thousand Dollar ($10,000.00) Limit; Less Than Ten Years of Service. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 74-215, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a Member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this subsection 8. of Section 74-215 if the benefits payable, with respect to such Member under this System and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the City contributes, do not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) for the applicable limitation year or for any prior limitation year, and the City has not at any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the Member participated; provided, however, that if the Member has completed less than ten (10) years of Credited Service with the City, the limit under this subsection 8. of Section 74-215 shall be a reduced limit equal to ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the Member's years of Credited Service and the denominator of which is ten (10). 
9.  Reduction of Benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the Member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which Member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which Member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the Board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the Member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which Member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the Board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the Board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such Member. 
10.  Service Credit Purchase Limits. 
A.  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a Member makes one or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the System, as allowed in Section 74-227 and 74-228, then the requirements of this Section will be treated as met only if: 
(1)  The requirements of Code Section 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of Code Section 415(b), or 
(2)  The requirements of Code Section 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of Code Section 415(c). 
For purposes of applying subparagraph (1), the System will not fail to meet the reduced limit under Code Section 415(b)(2)(c) solely by reason of this subparagraph , and for purposes of applying subparagraph (2) the System will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under Section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Code solely by reason of this subparagraph. 
B.  For purposes of this subsection the term "permissive service credit" means service credit- 
(1)  Recognized by the System for purposes of calculating a Member's benefit under the plan, 
(2)  Which such Member has not received under the plan, and 
(3)  Which such Member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the System, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the System, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding clause B.(2), may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a Member is receiving under the System. 
11.  Contributions Limits. 
A.  For purposes of applying the Code Section 415(c) limits which are incorporated by reference and for purposes of this subsection 11., only and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable will be compensation actually paid or made available during a limitation year, except as noted below and as permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the System, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of Code Section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under Code Sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052 and will be determined without regard to any rules under Code Section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code Section 3401(a)(2). 
(1)  However, for limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under Code Sections 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b). For limitation years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of Code Section 132(f)(4). 
(2)  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the limitation year will also include compensation paid by the later of 21/2 months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
(a)  The payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
(b)  The payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
(3)  Back pay, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this definition. 
B.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the Board may modify a request by a Member to make a contribution to the System if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in Code Section 415 by using the following methods: 
(1)  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the Board may establish a periodic payment deduction plan for the Member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under Code Sections 415(c) or 415(n). 
(2)  If payment pursuant to subparagraph (1) will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by Code Section 415(c), the Board may either reduce the Member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the Member's contribution. 
C.  If the annual additions for any Member for a limitation year exceed the limitation under Section 415(c) of the Code, the excess annual addition will be corrected as permitted under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (or similar IRS correction program). 
D.  For limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, a Member's compensation for purposes of this subsection 11. shall not exceed the annual limit under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code. 
12.  Additional Limitation on Pension Benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
A.  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a Retiree shall not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of his Average Final Compensation. However, nothing contained in this Section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
B.  No Member of the System shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the Member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to social security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 1223, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
13.  Effect of Direct Rollover on 415(b) Limit. If the plan accepts a direct rollover of an employee's or former employee's benefit from a defined contribution plan qualified under Code Section 401(a) which is maintained by the employer, any annuity resulting from the rollover amount that is determined using a more favorable actuarial basis than required under Code Section 417(e) shall be included in the annual benefit for purposes of the limit under Code Section 415(b). 
(Ord. No. 2786-09, § 1, 11-23-09; Ord. No. 2935-13, § 3, 8-26-13; Ord. No. 3037-16 , § 7, 6-13-16; Ord. No. 3121-18 , § 5, 8-27-18) 
Sec. 74-216. - Minimum distribution of benefits. 
1.  General Rules. 
A.  Effective Date. Effective as of January 1, 1989, the Plan will pay all benefits in accordance with a good faith interpretation of the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations in effect under that section, as applicable to a governmental plan within the meaning of Code Section 414(d). Effective on and after January 1, 2003, the Plan is also subject to the specific provisions contained in this Section. The provisions of this Section will apply for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for calendar years beginning with the 2003 calendar year. 
B.  Precedence. The requirements of this Section will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the Plan. 
C.  TEFRA Section 242(b)(2) Elections. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section other than this subsection 1.C., distributions may be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, in accordance with Section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) and the provisions of the plan that related to Section 242(b)(2) of TEFRA. 
2.  Time and Manner of Distribution. 
A.  Required Beginning Date. The Member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the Member no later than the Member's required beginning date which shall not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the Member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the Member terminates employment with the City. 
B.  Death of Member Before Distributions Begin. If the Member dies before distributions begin, the Member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than as follows: 
(1)  If the Member's surviving spouse is the Member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Member died, or by a date on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the Member would have attained age seventy and one-half (701/2), if later, as the surviving spouse elects. 
(2)  If the Member's surviving spouse is not the Member's sole designated beneficiary, then, distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Member died. 
(3)  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the Member's death, the Member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Member's death. 
(4)  If the Member's surviving spouse is the Member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the Member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection 2.B., other than subsection 2.B.(1), will apply as if the surviving spouse were the Member. 
For purposes of this subsection 2.B., distributions are considered to begin on the Member's required beginning date or, if subsection 2.B.(4) applies, the date of distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection 2.B.(1). If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the Member before the Member's required beginning date (or to the Member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection 2.B.(1)), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
C.  Death After Distributions Begin. If the Member dies after the required distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the Member's interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution before the Member's death. 
D.  Form of Distribution. Unless the Member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with this Section. If the Member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury regulations. Any part of the Member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in Section 414(k) of the Code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
3.  Determination of Amount to be Distributed Each Year. 
A.  General Requirements. If the Member's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the Plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
(1)  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one (1) year. 
(2)  The Member's entire interest must be distributed pursuant to Section 74-206, Section 74-207, Section 74-209, or Section 74-210 (as applicable) and in any event over a period equal to or less than the Member's life or the lives of the Member and a designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the Member or of the Member and a designated beneficiary. The life expectancy of the Member, the Member's spouse, or the Member's beneficiary may not be recalculated after the initial determination for purposes of determining benefits. 
B.  Amount Required to be Distributed by Required Beginning Date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the Member's required beginning date (or, if the Member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under Section 74-207) is the payment that is required for one (1) payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., monthly. All of the Member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the Member's required beginning date. 
C.  Additional Accruals After First Distribution Calendar Year. Any additional benefits accruing to the Member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
4.  General Distribution Rules. 
A.  The amount of an annuity paid to a Member's beneficiary may not exceed the maximum determined under the incidental death benefit requirement of Code Section 401(a)(9)(G), and effective for any annuity commencing on or after January 1, 2008, the minimum distribution incidental benefit rule under Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(a)(9)-6, Q&A-2. 
B.  The death and disability benefits provided by the Plan are limited by the incidental benefit rule set forth in Code Section 401(a)(9)(G) and Treasury Regulation Section 1.401-1(b)(1)(I) or any successor regulation thereto. As a result, the total death or disability benefits payable may not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the cost for all of the Members' benefits received from the retirement system. 
5.  Definitions. 
A.  Designated Beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the Plan and is the designated beneficiary under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4, of the Treasury regulations. 
B.  Distribution Calendar Year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the Member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the Member's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the Member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to Section 74-207.

Sec. 74-217. - Miscellaneous provisions. 
1.  Interest of Members in System. All assets of the Fund are held in trust and at no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the System with respect to Retirees and Members and their Spouses or Beneficiaries, shall any part of the corpus or income of the Fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit. 
2.  No Reduction of Accrued Benefit. No amendment or ordinance shall be adopted by the City Commission of the City of Winter Park which shall have the effect of reducing the then vested accrued benefits of Members or a Member's Beneficiaries.

Any modification or amendment of the System may be made retroactively, if necessary or appropriate, to qualify or maintain the System as a Plan meeting the requirements of the applicable provisions of the Code as now in effect or hereafter amended, or any other applicable provisions of the U.S. federal tax laws, as now in effect or hereafter amended or adopted, and the regulations issued thereunder. 
4.  Use of Forfeitures. Forfeitures arising from terminations of service of Members shall serve only to reduce future City contributions.

6.  USERRA. Effective December 12, 1994, notwithstanding any other provision of this System, contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military service are governed by Code Section 414(u) and the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, as amended. To the extent that the definition of "Credited Service" sets forth contribution requirements that are more favorable to the Member than the minimum compliance requirements, the more favorable provisions shall apply. 
7.  Vesting. 
A.  Member will be one hundred percent (100%) vested in all benefits upon attainment of the Plan's age and service requirements for the Plan's normal retirement benefit; and 
B.  A Member will be one hundred percent (100%) vested in all accrued benefits, to the extent funded, if the Plan is terminated or experiences a complete discontinuance of employer contributions. 
8.  Electronic Forms. In those circumstances where a written election or consent is not required by the Plan or the Code, an oral, electronic, or telephonic form in lieu of or in addition to a written form may be prescribed by the Board. However, where applicable, the Board shall comply with Treas. Reg. § 1.401(a)-21. 
9.  Compliance with Chapter 185, Florida Statutes. It is intended that the System will continue to qualify for funding under Section 185.08, Florida Statutes. Accordingly, unless otherwise required by law, any provision of the System which would disqualify the System from funding under Section 185.08, Florida Statutes, as amended from time to time, shall be superseded by and administered in accordance with the requirements of such chapter applicable to local law plans. 
(Ord. No. 2786-09, § 1, 11-23-09) 
Sec. 74-218. - Repeal or termination of System. 
1.  The ordinance establishing the System and Fund, and subsequent ordinances pertaining to said System and Fund, may be modified, terminated, or amended, in whole or in part; provided that if this or any subsequent ordinance shall be amended or repealed in its application to any person benefiting hereunder, the amount of benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment, or repeal shall have accrued to the Member or Beneficiary shall not be affected thereby. 
2.  If this ordinance shall be repealed, or if contributions to the System are discontinued or if there is a transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions as provided in Chapter 121, Florida Statutes, the Board shall continue to administer the System in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance, for the sole benefit of the then Members, any Beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one (1) of the options provided for in this ordinance who are designated by any of said Members. In the event of repeal, discontinuance of contributions, or transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions, there shall be full vesting (one hundred percent (100%)) of benefits accrued to date of repeal and such benefits shall be nonforfeitable. 
3.  The fund shall be distributed in accordance with the following procedures: 
A.  The Board shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value required to fund all the nonforfeitable benefits after taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The Board shall inform the City if additional assets are required, in which event the City shall continue to financially support the Plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded. 
B.  The Board shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or otherwise, for each Police Officer entitled to benefits under the plan as specified in subsection C. 
C.  The Board shall distribute the asset value as of the date of termination in the manner set forth in this subsection, on the basis that the amount required to provide any given retirement income is the actuarially computed single-sum value of such retirement income, except that if the method of distribution determined under subsection B. involves the purchase of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given retirement income is the single premium payable for such annuity. The actuarial single-sum value may not be less than the Police Officer's Accumulated Contributions to the Plan, with interest if provided by the Plan, less the value of any plan benefits previously paid to the Police Officer. 
D.  If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection C., and after the payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the City, less return to the State of the State's contributions, provided that, if the excess is less than the total contributions made by the City and the State to date of termination of the Plan, such excess shall be divided proportionately to the total contributions made by the City and the State. 
E.  The Board shall distribute, in accordance with subsection B., the amounts determined under subsection C. 
    If, after twenty-four (24) months after the date the Plan terminated or the date the Board received written notice that the contributions thereunder were being permanently discontinued, the City or the Board of the Fund affected has not complied with all the provisions in this Section, the Florida Department of Management Services will effect the termination of the Fund in accordance with this Section.

B.

3.  Exemption from Execution, Non-Assignability. Except as otherwise provided by law, the pensions, annuities, or any other benefits accrued or accruing to any person under the provisions of this ordinance and the Accumulated Contributions and the cash securities in the Fund created under this ordinance are hereby exempted from any state, county or municipal tax of the state and shall not be subject to execution, attachment, garnishment or any legal process whatsoever and shall be unassignable.

(Ord. No. 2786-09, § 1, 11-23-09) 
Sec. 74-224. - Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions, elimination of mandatory distributions. 
1.  Rollover Distributions. 
A.  General. This Section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the System to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this Section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
B.  Definitions. 
(1)  Eligible Rollover Distribution: An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distribute, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include the following: (i) any distribution that is one (1) of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated Beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; (ii) any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code; and (iii) the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income. Effective January 1, 2002, any portion of any distribution which would be includible in gross income as after tax employee contributions will be an eligible rollover distribution if the distribution is made to an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a); to an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b); to a qualified defined contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible; or on or after January 1, 2007, to a qualified defined benefit plan described in Code Section 401(a) or to an annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b), that agrees to separately account for amount so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not so includible. 
(2)  Eligible Retirement Plan: An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code; an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the Code; an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the Code, effective January 1, 2002, an eligible deferred compensation plan described in Section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by an eligible employer described in Section 457(e)(1)(A) of the Code and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan, effective January 1, 2002, an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code; a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the Code; or effective January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described in Section 408A of the Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. This definition shall also apply in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving Spouse. 
(3)  Distributee: A distributee includes an employee or former employee. It also includes the employee's or former employee's surviving Spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse. Effective January 1, 2007, it further includes a nonspouse beneficiary who is a designated beneficiary as defined by Code Section 401(a)(9)(E). However, a nonspouse beneficiary may rollover the distribution only to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving the distribution and the account or annuity will be treated as an "inherited" individual retirement account or annuity. 
(4)  Direct Rollover: A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
2.  Rollovers or Transfers into the Fund. On or after January 1, 2002, the System will accept, solely for the purpose of purchasing Credited Service as provided herein, permissible Member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans, Member rollover cash contributions and/or direct cash rollovers of distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, as follows: 
A.  Transfer and Direct Rollovers or Member Rollover Contributions from Other Plans. The System will accept either a direct rollover of an eligible rollover distribution or a Member contribution of an eligible rollover distribution from a qualified plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code, from an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Code or from an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state. The System will also accept legally permissible Member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans. 
B.  Member Rollover Contributions from IRAs. The system will accept a Member rollover contribution of the portion of a distribution from an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or 408(b) of the Code that is eligible to be rolled over. 
3.  Elimination of Mandatory Distributions. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event this Plan provides for a mandatory (involuntary) cash distribution from the Plan not otherwise required by law, for an amount in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), such distribution shall be made from the Plan only upon written request of the Member and completion by the Member of a written election on forms designated by the Board, to either receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount. 
(Ord. No. 2786-09, § 1, 11-23-09) 
Sec. 74-225. - Family and Medical Leave Act. 
    The fractional parts of the twelve (12) month period ending each March 1 that a Member is on leave without pay from the City pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), 29 U.S.C. §2611 et seq., shall be added to his Credited Service provided that: 
1.  The Member contributes to the Fund (i) the sum that he would have contributed, based on his Salary and the Member contribution rate in effect at the time that the Credited Service is requested, had he been a Member of the System for the fractional parts of the twelve (12) month period ending each March 1 for which he is requesting credit, plus (ii) an amount actuarially determined (using the actuarial assumptions that are used by this plan for purposes of its annual actuarial valuation) such that the crediting of service does not result in any cost to the Fund, plus (iii) payment of fees for all professional services rendered to the Board in connection with the Member's purchase of periods of Credited Service. 
2.

2.  Participation. 
A.  Eligibility to Participate. In lieu of terminating his employment as a Police Officer, any Member who is eligible for normal retirement under the System may elect to defer receipt of such service retirement pension and to participate in the DROP. 
B.  Election to Participate. A Member's election to participate in the DROP must be made in writing in a time and manner determined by the Board and shall be effective on the first day of the first calendar month which is at least fifteen (15) business days after it is received by the Board. 
C.  Period of Participation. A Member who elects to participate in the DROP under subsection 2.B., shall participate in the DROP for a period not to exceed sixty (60) months beginning at the time his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. An election to participate in the DROP shall constitute an irrevocable election to resign from the service of the City not later than the date provided for in the previous sentence. A Member may participate only once. 
D.  Termination of Participation. 
(1)  A Member's participation in the DROP shall cease at the earlier of: 
(a)  The end of his permissible period of participation in the DROP as determined under subsection 2.C.; or 
(b)  Termination of his employment as a Police Officer. 
(2)  Upon the Member's termination of participation in the DROP pursuant to subsection (1)(a) above, all amounts provided for in subsection 3.B., including monthly benefits and investment earnings and losses or interest, shall cease to be transferred from the System to his DROP Account. Any amounts remaining in his DROP Account shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of subsection 4. when he terminates his employment as a Police Officer. 
(3)  A Member who terminates his participation in the DROP under this subsection 2.D. shall not be permitted to again become a participant in the DROP. 
E.  Effect of DROP Participation on the System. 
(1)  A Member's Credited Service and his accrued benefit under the System shall be determined on the date his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. The Member shall not accrue any additional Credited Service or any additional benefits under the System (except for any supplemental benefit payable to DROP participants or any additional benefits provided under any cost-of-living adjustment for Retirees in the System) while he is a participant in the DROP. After a Member commences participation, he shall not be permitted to again contribute to the System nor shall he be eligible for disability or pre-retirement death benefits, except as provided for in Section 74-229, Reemployment After Retirement. 
(2)  No amounts shall be paid to a Member from the System while the Member is a participant in the DROP. Unless otherwise specified in the System, if a Member's participation in the DROP is terminated other than by terminating his employment as a Police Officer, no amounts shall be paid to him from the System until he terminates his employment as a Police Officer. Unless otherwise specified in the System, amounts transferred from the System to the Member's DROP Account shall be paid directly to the Member only upon the termination of his employment as a Police Officer. 
3.  Funding. 
A.  Establishment of DROP Account. A DROP Account shall be established for each Member participating in the DROP. A Member's DROP Account shall consist of amounts transferred to the DROP under subsection 3.B., and earnings or interest on those amounts. 
B.  Transfers from Retirement System. 
(1)  As of the first day of each month of a Member's period of participation in the DROP, the monthly retirement benefit he would have received under the System had he terminated his employment as a Police Officer and elected to receive monthly benefit payments thereunder shall be transferred to his DROP Account, except as otherwise provided for in subsection 2.D.(2). A Member's period of participation in the DROP shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of subsections 2.C. and 2.D., but in no event shall it continue past the date he terminates his employment as a Police Officer. 
(2)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection 2.D.(2), a Member's DROP Account under this subsection 3.B. shall be debited or credited with either: 
(a)  Interest at an effective rate of six and one-half percent (61/2%) per annum compounded monthly determined on the last business day of the prior month's ending balance and credited to the Member's DROP Account as of such date (to be applicable to all current and future DROP participants); or 
(b)  Earnings, to be credited or debited to the Member's DROP Account, determined as of the last business day of each fiscal year quarter and debited or credited as of such date, determined as follows: 
The average daily balance in a Member's DROP Account shall be credited or debited at a rate equal to the net investment return realized by the System for that quarter. "Net investment return" for the purpose of this paragraph is the total return of the assets in which the Member's DROP Account is invested by the Board net of brokerage commissions, management fees and transaction costs. 
For purposes of calculating earnings on a Member's DROP Account pursuant to this subsection 3.B.(2)(b)., brokerage commissions, transaction costs, and management fees shall be determined for each quarter by the investment consultant pursuant to contracts with fund managers as reported in the custodial statement. The investment consultant shall report these quarterly contractual fees to the Board. The investment consultant shall also report the net investment return for each manager and the net investment return for the total Plan assets. 
Upon electing participation in the DROP, the Member shall elect to receive either interest or earnings on his account to be determined as provided above. The Member may, in writing, elect to change his election only once during his DROP participation. An election to change must be made prior to the end of a quarter and shall be effective beginning the following quarter. This amendment to subsection 3.B.(2) shall apply to both current and future DROP participants. 
(3)  A Member's DROP Account shall only be credited or debited with earnings or interest and monthly benefits while the Member is a participant in the DROP. A Member's final DROP account value for distribution to the Member upon termination of participation in the DROP shall be the value of the account at the end of the quarter immediately preceding termination of participation for participants electing the net plan return and at the end of the month immediately preceding termination of participation for participants electing the flat interest rate return plus any monthly periodic additions made to the DROP account subsequent to the end of the previous quarter or month, as applicable, and prior to distribution. If a Member fails to terminate employment after participating in the DROP for the permissible period of DROP participation, then beginning with the Member's first month of employment following the last month of the permissible period of DROP participation, the Member's DROP Account will no longer be credited or debited with earnings or interest, nor will monthly benefits be transferred to the DROP account. All such non-transferred amounts shall be forfeited and continue to be forfeited while the Member is employed by the Police Department, and no cost-of-living adjustments shall be applied to the Member's credit during such period of continued employment. A Member employed by the Police Department after the permissible period of DROP participation will still not be eligible for pre-retirement death and disability benefits, and will accrue additional Credited Service or benefits only as provided for in Section 74-229. 
4.  Distribution of Drop Accounts on Termination of Employment. 
A.  Eligibility for Benefits. A Member shall receive the balance in his DROP Account in accordance with the provisions of this subsection 4. upon his termination of employment as a Police Officer. Except as provided in subsection 4.D., no amounts shall be paid to a Member from the DROP prior to his termination of employment as a Police Officer. 
B.  Form of Distribution. 
(1)  Distribution of the Member's DROP Account shall be made in a cash lump sum, subject to the direct rollover provisions set forth in subsection 4.F. Elections under this paragraph shall be in writing and shall be made in such time or manner as the Board shall determine. 
(2)  Notwithstanding the preceding, if a Member dies before his benefits are paid, his DROP Account shall be paid to his Beneficiary in such optional form as his Beneficiary may select. If no Beneficiary designation is made, the DROP Account shall be distributed to the Member's estate. 
C.  Date of Payment of Distribution. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection 4., distribution of a Member's DROP Account shall be made as soon as administratively practicable following the Member's termination of employment. Distribution of the amount in a Member's DROP account will not be made unless the Member completes a written request for distribution and a written election, on forms designated by the Board, to either receive a cash lump sum or a rollover of the lump sum amount. 
D.  Proof of Death and Right of Beneficiary or Other Person. The Board may require and rely upon such proof of death and such evidence of the right of any Beneficiary or other person to receive the value of a deceased Member's DROP Account as the Board may deem proper and its determination of the right of that Beneficiary or other person to receive payment shall be conclusive. 
E.  Distribution Limitation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection 4., all distributions from the DROP shall conform to the "Minimum Distribution Of Benefits" provisions as provided for herein. 
F.  Direct Rollover of Certain Distributions . Notwithstanding any provision of the DROP to the contrary, a distributee may elect to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid in a direct rollover as otherwise provided under the System in Section 74-224. 
5.  Administration of DROP. 
A.  Board Administers the DROP. The general administration of the DROP, the responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the DROP and the responsibility of overseeing the investment of the DROP's assets shall be placed in the Board. The Members of the Board may appoint from their number such subcommittees with such powers as they shall determine; may adopt such administrative procedures and regulations as they deem desirable for the conduct of their affairs; may authorize one (1) or more of their number or any agent to execute or deliver any instrument or make any payment on their behalf; may retain counsel, employ agents and provide for such clerical, accounting, actuarial and consulting services as they may require in carrying out the provisions of the DROP; and may allocate among themselves or delegate to other persons all or such portion of their duties under the DROP, other than those granted to them as trustee under any trust agreement adopted for use in implementing the DROP, as they, in their sole discretion, shall decide. A trustee shall not vote on any question relating exclusively to himself. 
B.  Individual Accounts, Records and Reports. The Board shall maintain records showing the operation and condition of the DROP, including records showing the individual balances in each Member's DROP Account, and the Board shall keep in convenient form such data as may be necessary for the valuation of the assets and liabilities of the DROP. The Board shall prepare and distribute to Members participating in the DROP and other individuals or file with the appropriate governmental agencies, as the case may be, all necessary descriptions, reports, information returns, and data required to be distributed or filed for the DROP pursuant to the Code and any other applicable laws. 
C.  Establishment of Rules. Subject to the limitations of the DROP, the Board from time to time shall establish rules for the administration of the DROP and the transaction of its business. The Board shall have discretionary authority to construe and interpret the DROP (including but not limited to determination of an individual's eligibility for DROP participation, the right and amount of any benefit payable under the DROP and the date on which any individual ceases to be a participant in the DROP). The determination of the Board as to the interpretation of the DROP or its determination of any disputed questions shall be conclusive and final to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
D.  Limitation of Liability. 
(1)  The trustees shall not incur any liability individually or on behalf of any other individuals for any act or failure to act, made in good faith in relation to the DROP or the funds of the DROP. 
(2)  Neither the Board nor any trustee of the Board shall be responsible for any reports furnished by any expert retained or employed by the Board, but they shall be entitled to rely thereon as well as on certificates furnished by an accountant or an actuary, and on all opinions of counsel. The Board shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in reliance upon such expert, accountant, actuary or counsel, and all actions taken or suffered in such reliance shall be conclusive upon any person with any interest in the DROP. 
E.  Expenses. To compensate the System for the expenses of administering and operating the DROP, each Member's DROP Account shall be charged an annual administrative fee which shall be reviewed and subject to increase or decrease annually. The initial expense charge of three-quarters of one percent (0.75%) of the account balance, shall be deducted from the Member's DROP Account after each fiscal year quarter at the rate of 0.1875% of the account's average daily balance during that quarter. 
6.  General Provisions. 
A.  The DROP is not a separate retirement plan . Instead, it is a program under which a Member who is eligible for normal retirement under the System may elect to accrue future retirement benefits in the manner provided in this Section 74-226 for the remainder of his employment, rather than in the normal manner provided under the plan. Under termination of employment, a Member is entitled to a lump sum distribution of his or her DROP Account balance or may elect a rollover. The DROP Account distribution is in addition to the Member's monthly benefit. 
B.  Notional account . The DROP Account established for such a Member is a notional account, used only for the purpose of calculation of the DROP distribution amount. It is not a separate account in the System. There is no change in the System's assets, and there is no distribution available to the Member until the Member's termination from the DROP. The Member has no control over the investment of the DROP Account. 
C.  No employer discretion . The DROP benefit is determined pursuant to a specific formula which does not involve employer discretion. 
D.  IRC limit . The DROP Account distribution, along with other benefits payable from the System, is subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b). 
E.  Amendment of DROP . The DROP may be amended by an ordinance of the City at any time and from time to time, and retroactively if deemed necessary or appropriate, to amend in whole or in part any or all of the provisions of the DROP. However, except as otherwise provided by law, no amendment shall make it possible for any part of the DROP's funds to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of persons entitled to benefits under the DROP. No amendment shall be made which has the effect of decreasing the balance of the DROP Account of any Member. 
F.  Facility of Payment . If a Member or other person entitled to a benefit under the DROP is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident or is a minor, the Board shall direct that any benefit due him shall be made only to a duly appointed legal representative. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of the liabilities of the DROP for that benefit. 
G.  Information . Each Member, beneficiary or other person entitled to a benefit, before any benefit shall be payable to him or on his account under the DROP, shall file with the Board the information that it shall require to establish his rights and benefits under the DROP. 
H.  Prevention of Escheat . If the Board cannot ascertain the whereabouts of any person to whom a payment is due under the DROP, the Board may, no earlier than three (3) years from the date such payment is due, mail a notice of such due and owing payment to the last known address of such person, as shown on the records of the Board or the City. If such person has not made written claim therefor within three (3) months of the date of the mailing, the Board may, if it so elects and upon receiving advice from counsel to the DROP, direct that such payment and all remaining payments otherwise due such person be canceled on the records of the DROP. Upon such cancellation, the DROP shall have no further liability therefor except that, in the event such person or his Beneficiary later notifies the Board of his whereabouts and requests the payment or payments due to him under the DROP, the amount so applied shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of the DROP. 
I.  Written Elections, Notification . 
(1)  Any elections, notifications or designations made by a Member pursuant to the provisions of the DROP shall be made in writing and filed with the Board in a time and manner determined by the Board under rules uniformly applicable to all employees similarly situated. The Board reserves the right to change from time to time and manner for making notifications, elections or designations by Members under the DROP if it determines after due deliberation that such action is justified in that it improves the administration of the DROP. In the event of a conflict between the provisions for making an election, notification or designation set forth in the DROP and such new administrative procedures, those new administrative procedures shall prevail. 
(2)  Each Member or Retiree who has a DROP Account shall be responsible for furnishing the Board with his current address and any subsequent changes in his address. Any notice required to be given to a Member or Retiree hereunder shall be deemed given if directed to him at the last such address given to the Board and mailed by registered or certified United States mail. If any check mailed by registered or certified United States mail to such address is returned, mailing of checks will be suspended until such time as the Member or Retiree notifies the Board of his address. 
J.  Benefits Not Guaranteed . All benefits payable to a Member from the DROP shall be paid only from the assets of the Member's DROP Account and neither the City nor the Board shall have any duty or liability to furnish the DROP with any funds, securities or other assets except to the extent required by any applicable law. 
K.  Construction . 
(1)  The DROP shall be construed, regulated and administered under the laws of Florida, except where other applicable law controls. 
(2)  The titles and headings of the subsections in this Section 74-226 are for convenience only. In the case of ambiguity or inconsistency, the text rather than the titles or headings shall control. 
L.  Forfeiture of Retirement Benefits . Nothing in this Section shall be construed to remove DROP participants from the application of any forfeiture provisions applicable to the System. DROP participants shall be subject to forfeiture of all retirement benefits, including DROP benefits. 
M.  Effect of DROP Participation on Employment . Participation in the DROP is not a guarantee of employment and DROP participants shall be subject to the same employment standards and policies that are applicable to employees who are not DROP participants.

1.  The Member contributes to the Fund the sum that he would have contributed, based on his Salary and the Member contribution rate in effect at the time that the Credited Service is requested, had he been a Member of the System for the years or fractional parts of years for which he is requesting credit plus amounts actuarially determined such that the crediting of service does not result in any cost to the Fund plus payment of costs for all professional services rendered to the Board in connection with the purchase of years of Credited Service. 
2.  Multiple requests to purchase Credited Service pursuant to this Section may be made at any time prior to Retirement. 
3.  Payment by the Member of the required amount shall be made within six (6) months of his request for credit, but not later than the retirement date, and shall be made in one (1) lump sum payment upon receipt of which Credited Service shall be given.

5.  Credited Service purchased pursuant to this Section shall count for all purposes, except vesting and eligibility for not-in-line of duty disability benefits. 
(Ord. No. 2786-09, § 1, 11-23-09) 
Sec. 74-228. - Prior police service. 
    Unless otherwise prohibited by law, and except as provided for in Section 74-201, the years or fractional parts of years that a Member previously served as a Police Officer with the City during a period of previous employment and for which period Accumulated Contributions were withdrawn from the Fund, or the years and fractional parts of years that a Member served as a Police Officer for any other municipal, county or state law enforcement department in the State of Florida shall be added to his years of Credited Service provided that: 
1.  The Member contributes to the Fund the sum that he would have contributed, based on his Salary and the Member contribution rate in effect at the time that the Credited Service is requested, had he been a Member of the System for the years or fractional parts of years for which he is requesting credit plus amounts actuarially determined such that the crediting of service does not result in any cost to the Fund plus payment of costs for all professional services rendered to the Board in connection with the purchase of years of Credited Service. 
2.  Multiple requests to purchase Credited Service pursuant to this Section may be made at any time prior to Retirement. 
3.  Payment by the Member of the required amount shall be made within six (6) months of his request for credit, but not later than the retirement date, and shall be made in one (1) lump sum payment upon receipt of which Credited Service shall be given. 
4.  The maximum credit under this Section for service other than with the City of Winter Park shall be five (5) years of Credited Service and shall count for all purposes, except vesting and eligibility for not-in-line of duty disability benefits. There shall be no maximum purchase of credit for prior service with the City of Winter Park and such credit shall count for all purposes, including vesting. 
5.  In no event, however, may Credited Service be purchased pursuant to this Section for prior service with any other municipal, county or state law enforcement department, if such prior service forms or will form the basis of a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan as set forth in Section 74-215, subsection 12.B. 
6.  For purposes of determining credit for prior service as a Police Officer as provided for in this Section, in addition to service as a Police Officer in this State, credit may be purchased by the Member in the same manner as provided above for federal, other state, county or municipal service if the prior service is recognized by the Criminal Justice Standards and Training Commission within the Department of Law Enforcement, as provided under Chapter 943, Florida Statutes, or the Police Officer provides proof to the Board that such service is equivalent to the service required to meet the definition of a Police Officer under Section 74-201. 
(Ord. No. 2786-09, § 1, 11-23-09; Ord. No. 3037-16 , § 10, 6-13-16) 
Sec. 74-229. - Reemployment after retirement. 
1.  Any Retiree under this System, except for disability retirement as previously provided for, may be reemployed by any public or private employer, except the City, and may receive compensation from that employment without limiting or restricting in any way the retirement benefits payable under this System. Reemployment by the City shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this Section. 
2.  After Normal Retirement. Any Retiree who is retired under normal (or early) retirement pursuant to this System and who is reemployed as a Police Officer and, by virtue of that reemployment, is eligible to participate in this System, shall upon being reemployed, discontinue receipt of benefits. Upon reemployment, the Member shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional Credited Service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final Retirement. Calculations of benefits upon Retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, Average Final Compensation, and Credited Service (and early retirement reduction factor, if applicable) as of that date and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, Average Final Compensation (based only on the subsequent employment period and not including any period of DROP participation), and Credited Service (and early retirement reduction factor, if applicable) as of the date of subsequent retirement. The amount of any death or disability benefit received during a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the Retiree may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable only to the subsequent retirement benefit. 
3.  Any Retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this System who is reemployed by the City in a position other than as a Police Officer, shall upon being reemployed, continue receipt of retirement benefits during any subsequent period of employment. Former DROP participants shall begin receipt of benefits under these circumstances. 
4.  After Early Retirement. Any Retiree who is retired under early retirement pursuant to this System and who subsequently becomes an employee of the City in any capacity, shall discontinue receipt of benefits from the System. If the reemployed person, by virtue of his reemployment, is eligible to participate in this System, that person shall accrue a second benefit as provided for in subsection 2. above and benefit payments shall remain suspended during any such subsequent employment period. If the reemployed person is not eligible to participate in this System, that person's pension benefit payments shall be suspended until the earlier of termination of employment or such time as the reemployed retiree reaches the date that he would have been eligible for normal retirement under this system had he continued employment and not elected early retirement. "Normal retirement" as used in this subsection shall be the current normal retirement date provided under this System. 
5.  Reemployment of Terminated Vested Persons. Reemployed terminated vested persons shall not be subject to the provisions of this Section until such time as they begin to actually receive benefits. Upon receipt of benefits, terminated vested persons shall be treated as normal or early Retirees for purposes of applying the provisions of this Section and their status as an early or normal Retiree shall be determined by the date they elect to begin to receive their benefit. 
6.  DROP Participants. Members or Retirees who are or were in the Deferred Retirement Option Plan shall, following termination of employment after DROP participation, have the options provided for in this Section for reemployment. 
(Ord. No. 2786-09, § 1, 11-23-09) 
Sec. 74-230. - Supplemental benefit component for special benefits; chapter 185 share accounts. 
    There is hereby established an additional plan component to provide special benefits in the form of a supplemental retirement, termination, death and disability benefits to be in addition to the benefits provided for in the previous Sections of this Plan, such benefit to be funded solely and entirely by Chapter 185 premium tax monies for each Plan Year which are allocated to this supplemental component as provided for in Section 185.35. Amounts allocated to this supplemental component ("Share Plan") shall be further allocated to the members as follows: 
1.  Individual Member Share Accounts . The Board shall create individual Member share accounts and maintain appropriate books and records showing the respective interest of each Member hereunder. Each Member shall have a Member share account for his share of the Chapter 185 tax revenues described above, forfeitures and income and expense adjustments relating thereto. The Board shall maintain a separate membership share account for each Member, however, the maintenance of separate accounts is for accounting purposes only and a segregation of the assets of the trust fund to each account shall not be required or permitted. 
2.  Share Account Funding . 
A.  Individual Member share accounts shall be established as of September 30, 2015 for all Members who were actively employed as of October 1, 2014. Individual Member share accounts shall be credited with an allocation as provided for in the following subsection 3. of any premium tax monies which have been allocated to the Share Plan for that Plan Year, beginning with the Plan Year ending September 30, 2019. 
B.  In addition, any forfeitures as provided in subsection 4, shall be allocated to the individual Member share accounts in accordance with the formula set forth in subsection 4. 
3.  Allocation of Monies to Share Accounts . 
A.  Allocation of Chapter 185 Contributions . 
(1)  Effective as of September 30, 2019, the amount of any premium tax monies allocated to the Share Plan shall be allocated to individual Member share accounts as provided for in this subsection. Members retiring (or entering DROP) on or after October 1, 2018 and prior to September 30, 2019 shall receive an allocation. In addition, all premium tax monies allocated to the share plan in any subsequent Plan Year shall also be allocated as provided for in this subsection. Available premium tax monies shall be allocated to individual Member share accounts at the end of each plan year on September 30 (a "valuation date"). 
(2)  On each valuation date, each current actively employed Member of the plan not participating in the DROP, each DROP participant and each Retiree who retires or DROP participant who has terminated DROP participation in the Plan Year ending on the valuation date (including each disability Retiree), or Beneficiary of a deceased Member (not including terminated vested persons) who is otherwise eligible for an allocation as of the valuation date shall receive a share allocation as follows: 
(3)  The total funds subject to allocation on each valuation date shall be allocated to each share account of those eligible for an allocation in an amount equal to a fraction of the total amount, the numerator of which shall be the individual's total years and fractional parts of years of Credited Service as of the valuation date, and the denominator of which shall be the sum of the total years and fractional parts of years of Credited Service as of the valuation date of all individuals to whom allocations are being made. Beneficiaries shall receive an allocation based on the years of Credited Service of the deceased Member. 
(4)  Re-employed Retirees shall be deemed new employees and shall receive an allocation based solely on the Credited Service in the reemployment period. 
B.  Allocation of Investment Gains and Losses . On each valuation date, each individual share account shall be adjusted to reflect the net earnings or losses resulting from investments during the year. The net earnings or losses allocated to the individual member share accounts shall be the same percentage which is earned or lost by the total plan investments, including realized and unrealized gains or losses, net of brokerage commissions, transaction costs and management fees. 
Net earnings or losses are determined as of the last business day of the fiscal year, which is the valuation date, and are debited or credited as of such date. 
For purposes of calculating net earnings or losses on a Member's share account pursuant to this subsection, brokerage commissions, transaction costs, and management fees for the immediately preceding fiscal year shall be determined for each year by the investment consultant pursuant to contracts with fund managers as reported in the custodial statement. The investment consultant shall report these annual contractual fees to the board. The investment consultant shall also report the net investment return for each manager and the net investment return for the total plan assets. 
C.  Allocation of Costs, Fees and Expenses . On each valuation date, each individual share account shall be adjusted to allocate its pro rata share of the costs, fees and expenses of administration of the share plan. These fees shall be allocated to each individual Member share account on a proportionate basis taking the costs, fees and expenses of administration of the Share Plan as a whole multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total assets in each individual Member share account (after adding the annual investment gain or loss) and the denominator of which is the total assets of the fund as a whole as of the same date. 
D.  No Right to Allocation . The fact of allocation or credit of an allocation to a Member's share account by the Board shall not vest in any Member, any right, title, or interest in the assets of the trust or in the Chapter 185 tax revenues except at the time or times, to the extent, and subject to the terms and conditions provided in this Section. 
E.  Members shall be provided annual statements setting forth their share account balance as of the end of the Plan Year. 
4.  Forfeitures . Any Member who has less than ten (10) years of service credit and who is not otherwise eligible for payment of benefits after termination of employment with the City as provided for in subsection 5. shall forfeit his individual Member share account or the non-vested portion thereof. Forfeited amounts shall be redistributed to the other individual Member accounts on each valuation date in an amount determined in accordance with subsection 3.A.. 
5.  Eligibility For Benefits . Any Member (or his beneficiary) who terminates employment as a Police Officer with the City or who dies, upon application filed with the Board, shall be entitled to be paid the value of his individual Member share account, subject to the following criteria:

    Special assessments against property deemed to be benefited by local improvements, as provided for in section 86-27, shall be assessed upon the property specially benefited by the improvement in proportion to the benefits to be derived therefrom, such special benefits to be determined and prorated according to the foot frontage of the respective properties specially benefited by the improvement or by such other method as the city commission may prescribe. 
(Laws of Fla. ch. 27986 (1951), § 2) 
Sec. 86-29. - Resolution for improvements.

(3)  The manner in which the assessment shall be made; 
(4)  When the assessments are to be paid; 
(5)  What part, if any, shall be apportioned to be paid from the general improvement fund of the city; and 
(6)  The lands upon which the special assessment shall be levied. In describing the lands it shall be sufficient to describe the lots and lands deemed to be specially benefited abutting upon and contiguous to the contemplated improvement, as "all lots and lands adjoining and contiguous or bounding and abutting upon such improvement." 
Such resolution shall also state the total estimated cost of the improvement.

    Upon the adoption of the resolution as provided in section 86-29, the city commission shall cause to be made an assessment roll in accordance with the method of assessment provided for in the resolution, which assessment roll shall be completed and filed with the city commission as promptly as possible. The assessment roll shall show the lots and lands assessed, the amount of the assessment against each lot or parcel of land, and, if the assessment is to be paid in installments, the number of annual installments in which the assessment is divided shall also be entered and shown upon the assessment roll. 
(Laws of Fla. ch. 27986 (1951), § 6)

In the publication of the special assessment roll, the city commission shall cause to be attached to the copy of the assessment roll published a notice directed to all property owners interested in the assessments of the time and place where complaints will be heard with reference to the assessments and when the assessment roll will be finally approved and confirmed by the city commission sitting as an equalization board. 
(Laws of Fla. ch. 27986 (1951), § 7) 
Sec. 86-34. - Equalizing board; liens; rebates.

However, upon the completion of the sanitary sewer improvement, the city shall rebate to the owner of any property which shall have been specially assessed for any sanitary sewer improvement the difference in the assessment as originally made, approved and confirmed, and the proportionate part of the actual cost of sanitary sewer improvement to be paid by special assessment as finally determined upon the completion of the sanitary sewer improvement. 
(Laws of Fla. ch. 27986 (1951), § 8) 
Sec. 86-35. - Payment of assessment. 
    Special assessments for the sanitary sewer improvement shall be payable by the owners of the property abutting upon the sanitary sewer assessed for the improvement at the time and in the manner stipulated in the resolution providing for the improvement. The assessment shall be and remain a lien superior in dignity to all other liens, except liens for taxes, until paid, from the date of the assessment upon the respective lot and parcel of land assessed. The assessment shall bear interest at the rate of eight percent per annum and may be, by the resolution required in this article, made payable in ten equal yearly installments, with accrued interest on all deferred payments, unless paid within 30 days after the assessment shall stand approved and confirmed, as provided in section 86-34. 
(Laws of Fla. ch. 27986 (1951), § 9) 
Sec. 86-36. - Payment of assessment in annual installments. 
    Each annual installment provided for in section 86-35 shall be paid upon the dates specified in the resolution, with interest upon all deferred payments, until the entire amount of the assessment has been paid. Upon the failure of any property owner to pay any annual installment due or any part thereof or any annual interest upon deferred payments, the city commission shall cause to be brought the necessary legal proceedings by a bill in chancery to enforce payment thereof with all accrued interest, together with all legal costs incurred, including a reasonable attorney's fee, to be assessed as part of the costs. For default in the payment of any installment of an assessment or any accrued interest on the assessment, the whole assessment, with the interest thereon, shall immediately become due and payable and subject to foreclosure. In the foreclosure of any special assessment, service of process against unknown or nonresident defendants may be had by publication, as provided by law in other chancery suits. The foreclosure proceedings shall be prosecuted to a sale and conveyance of the property involved in the proceedings as provided by law in suits to foreclose mortgages. 
(Laws of Fla. ch. 27986 (1951), § 10) 
Sec. 86-37. - Effect of invalid assessment. 
    If any special assessment made under the provisions of this article to defray the whole or any part of the expense of any sanitary sewer improvement shall be either in whole or in part annulled, vacated or set aside by the judgment of any court or if the city commission is satisfied that any such assessment is so irregular or defective that the assessment cannot be enforced or collected or if the city commission shall have omitted to make such assessment when it might have done so, the city commission shall take all necessary steps to cause a new assessment to be made for the whole or any part of any improvement or against any property benefited by any improvement, following as nearly as may be the provisions of this article. If such second assessment shall be annulled, the city commission may obtain and make other assessments until a valid assessment shall be made. 
(Laws of Fla. ch. 27986 (1951), § 11) 
Sec. 86-38. - Payment of certain costs by city. 
    The city commission shall have the power to pay out of its general funds or out of any special fund that may be provided for that purpose such portion of the cost of any sanitary sewer improvement as it may deem proper. Interest accruing while an improvement is under construction and, for six months thereafter, all engineering and inspection costs, including a proper proportion of the compensation, salaries and expenses of the engineering staff of the city properly chargeable to any improvement, shall be considered a part of the cost of the improvement. 
(Laws of Fla. ch. 27986 (1951), § 12) 
Sec. 86-39. - Validity. 
    Any informality or irregularity in the proceedings in connection with the levy of any special assessment under the provisions of this article shall not affect the validity of the proceedings where the assessment roll has been confirmed by the city commission, and the assessment roll as finally approved and confirmed shall be competent and sufficient evidence that the assessment was duly levied, that the assessment was duly made and adopted, and that all other proceedings adequate to the adoption of the assessment roll were duly had, taken and performed as required by this article. No variance from the directions under this article shall be held material unless it is clearly shown that the party objecting was materially injured thereby.

Sec. 86-70. - Levy and collection. 
(a)  Generally. The city may finance the costs of the projects and/or the services by levying and collecting special assessments on the specially benefitted property, as provided below. Special assessments shall be levied only on benefitted real property at a rate of assessment based on the special benefit accruing to such property from such projects and/or services, as applicable, when the projects and/or the services funded by the special assessments provide a benefit which is different in type or degree from benefits provided to the community as a whole; and the amount of the special assessment for each parcel of land is not in excess of the proportional benefits as compared to other special assessments on other parcels of real property in the area of the city. 
(b)  Procedure. 
(1)  Method of proration. Special assessments against property deemed to be benefitted by local improvements shall be assessed upon the property specially benefitted by the improvement or program in proportion to the benefits to be derived therefrom, such special benefits to be determined and prorated according to the method of apportionment based upon one or more of the following methods or any combination thereof: 
a.  The foot frontage of the respective properties specially benefitted by the project; 
b.  The square footage of the respective properties specially benefitted by the project; 
c.  The assessed value of the respective properties specially benefitted by the project; or 
d.  Such other method as shall apportion the assessments equitably among the specially benefitted property. 
(2)  Resolution declaring projects, services and assessments. When the city may determine to construct any project, or provide any services, and defray the whole or any part of the cost thereof by special assessments, the commission shall so declare by resolution stating the nature of the proposed project and, if applicable, the services, designating, if applicable, the street or sidewalks to be so improved, and the location of the project, the portion of the cost thereof to be paid by special assessments, the manner in which the assessments shall be made, when the assessments are to be paid, and what part, if any, shall be paid from the general fund or other funds of the city. Such resolution shall also designate the lands upon which the special assessments shall be levied, and in describing the lands it shall be sufficient to describe them as "all lots and lands adjoining and contiguous or bounding and abutting upon such improvements, or specially benefitted thereby, and further designated by the assessment plat described below." The resolution shall also state the total estimated cost of the project and, if applicable, the assessed cost of the services and the assessment rate for such services. Such estimated cost may include: 
a.  The cost of construction or reconstruction; the cost of all labor and materials; 
b.  The cost of all lands, property rights, easements and franchises acquired; financing charges; 
c.  Interest prior to and during construction, and for one year after completion of construction; discount on the sale of obligations; 
d.  The cost of plans and specifications, surveys and estimates of costs and of revenues; 
e.  The cost of engineering and legal services; 
f.  All other expenses necessary or incident to determining the feasibility or practicability of such construction or reconstruction and, if applicable, the provision of the services; administrative expenses; and 
g.  Such other costs as may be necessary or incident to the financing thereof, including reimbursement to the city of money advanced for such costs. 
(3)  Description and estimated cost of improvements and/or services required. At the time of the adoption of the resolution specified in subsection (2) above, there shall be on file with the city clerk an assessment plat showing the area to be assessed, with a description of the project and, if applicable, the services, which description may include preliminary or final plans or drawings, and an estimate of cost of the proposed project and, if applicable, the services, which assessment plat, description and estimate shall be open to inspection of the public. 
(4)  Publication of resolution. Upon the adoption of the resolution specified in subsection (2) above, the city clerk shall cause such resolution to be published one time in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. 
(5)  Preliminary assessment roll. Upon the adoption of the resolution described in subsection (2) above, the commission shall cause to be made a preliminary assessment roll in accordance with the method of assessment specified in such resolution, which assessment roll shall be completed as promptly as possible. The assessment roll shall show the lots and lands assessed and the amount of the benefit to and the assessment against each lot or parcel of land, and, if the assessment is to be paid in installments, the number of annual installments of the assessment. 
(6)  Same-Publication. Upon completion of the preliminary assessment roll, the commission shall by resolution fix a time and place at which the owners of the property to be assessed, or any other persons interested therein, may appear and be heard as to the propriety and advisability of constructing such project and, if applicable, providing such services, as to the cost thereof, as to the manner of payment therefor, and as to the amount thereof to be assessed against each property so improved. Ten days' prior notice in writing of such time and place shall be given to such property owners. The notice shall include the amount of the assessment and shall be served by mailing a copy to each of such property owners at his last known address. The names and addresses of such property owners shall be obtained from the records of the property appraiser or from such other sources as the city clerk or city engineer deems reliable, proof of such mailing to be made by affidavit of the city clerk or deputy city clerk, or by the city engineer, such proof to be filed with the city clerk; provided, that failure to mail such notice or notices shall not invalidate any of the proceedings hereunder. Notice of the time and place of such hearing shall also be given by two publications a week apart in a newspaper of general circulation in the city; provided, that the last publication shall be at least one week prior to the date of the hearing. Such notice shall describe the streets or other areas to be improved, shall advise all persons interested that the description of each property to be assessed and the amount to be assessed to each piece or parcel of property may be ascertained at the office of the city clerk, and shall set forth the time and place at which the commission shall meet as an assessment equalization board. Such service by publication shall be verified by the affidavit of the publisher filed with the city clerk. Such hearing shall be before the commission or, if so determined by the commission, before one or more special masters appointed by the commission. If one or more special masters are so appointed, then such special masters shall meet at the time and place named in the notice required above to hear and consider any and all complaints as to the special assessments, and shall recommend to the commission such adjustments and equalizations as shall in their opinion be just and right. 
(7)  Equalizing board to hear complaints and adjust assessments; adjustment of difference in cost and assessment. At the time and place named in the notice specified in subsection (6) above, the commission shall meet as an equalizing board to hear and consider any and all complaints as to the special assessments and the recommendation of the special masters, if any, and shall adjust and equalize the assessments on a basis of justice and right. When so equalized and approved by resolution of the commission, a final assessment roll shall be filed with the city clerk, and such assessments shall stand confirmed and remain legal, valid, and binding first liens upon the property against which such assessments are made until paid; however, upon completion of a project, the city shall add or credit to each of the assessments the difference in the assessment as originally made, approved and confirmed and the proportionate part of the actual cost to be paid by special assessments as finally determined upon the completion of the project, but in no event shall the final assessments exceed the amount of benefits originally assessed. The adoption of such resolution by the commission shall constitute a legislative determination that all property assessed derives a special benefit from the projects and/or services to be constructed and/or provided, and that the assessments are fairly and reasonably apportioned among the properties that receive the special benefit. Promptly after such confirmation, the assessments shall be recorded by the city clerk in the official records of the county, and such record of the liens shall constitute prima facie evidence of their validity. The commission may by resolution grant a discount equal to all or a part of the payee's proportionate share of the cost of a project consisting of bond financing costs, such as capitalized interest, funded reserves and bond discount included in the estimated cost of the project, upon payment in full of any assessment during such period prior to the time such financing costs are incurred as may be specified by the commission. 
(c)  Alternate method of prorating special assessments; alternate procedures for levying variable assessments. 
(1)  Generally. If the commission shall find and declare that the special benefits to be derived by the property deemed to be benefitted by the local improvements shall be equally and fairly apportioned among the specially benefitted property by reference to the value of such property, as set forth on the real property assessment roll prepared by the property appraiser for the county from year to year, then the special assessments may be prorated and levied as described below. Furthermore, special assessments for any annually recurring services shall also be prorated and levied as described below. Special assessments prorated and levied under this section shall be known as "variable assessments." In each year the city shall levy variable assessments in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection (2) below, until the costs of the project and/or the services, as applicable, have been paid in full and any obligations issued to pay such costs have been retired. 
(2)  Method of proration of variable assessments. 
a.  Variable assessments shall be prorated against the property deemed to be specially benefitted by the projects and/or the services, as applicable, in proportion to the benefits to be derived therefrom, such special benefits to be determined and prorated annually in accordance with the special benefits received and the portion of the cost of the projects and/or the services, as applicable, to be paid from the variable assessments. 
b.  The amount of each installment of the variable assessments should be initially prorated as set forth below and in the resolution declaring such variable assessments, and shall thereafter be equalized and finalized as described below. 
(3)  Resolution to declare variable assessments. When the city may determine to construct any project, or provide any services, and defray the whole or any part of the cost thereof by variable assessments, the commission shall so declare by resolution stating the nature of the proposed project and, if applicable, the services, designating, if applicable, the streets or sidewalks to be so improved, and the location of the project, the portion of the cost thereof to be paid by variable assessments, the manner in which such assessments shall be made, when such assessments are to be paid, and what part, if any, shall be paid from the general fund or other funds of the city. Such resolution shall also designate the lands upon which the variable assessments shall be levied, and in describing such lands it shall be sufficient to describe them as "all lots and lands adjoining and contiguous or bounding and abutting upon such improvements, or specially benefitted thereby, and further designated by the assessment plat described below." The resolution shall also state the total estimated cost of the project and, if applicable, the assessed cost of the services and the initial assessment rate for such services. Such estimated cost may include: 
a.  The cost of construction or reconstruction; 
b.  The cost of all labor and materials; 
c.  The cost of all lands, property rights, easements and franchises acquired; 
d.  Financing charges; 
e.  Interest prior to and during construction, and for one year after completion of construction;

i.  All other expenses necessary or incident to determining the feasibility or practicability of such construction or reconstruction, and, if applicable, the provisions of the services; administrative expenses; and 
j.  Such other costs as may be necessary or incident to the financing thereof, including reimbursement to the city of money advanced for such costs. 
(4)  Description and estimated cost of improvements and/or services required. At the time of adoption of the resolution specified in subsection (3) above, there shall be on file with the city clerk, an assessment plat showing the area to be assessed, with a description of the project and, if applicable, the services, which description may include preliminary or final plans or drawings, and an estimate of cost of the proposed project and, if applicable, the services, which assessment plat, description and estimate shall be open to inspection of the public. 
(5)  Publication of resolution. Upon the adoption of the resolution specified in subsection (3) above, the city clerk shall cause the resolution to be published one time in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. 
(6)  Preliminary assessment roll. In each applicable year, the commission shall cause to be made a preliminary assessment roll, which assessment roll shall be completed as promptly as possible. The preliminary assessment roll shall set forth the lots and lands assessed and, with respect to each such lot and parcel of land: 
a.  The amount of special benefit to such lot or parcel of land and the method of proration of such special benefit; and 
b.  The amount of the annual installment of the assessment due in the current fiscal year. 
(7)  Same-Publication. Upon completion of the preliminary assessment roll, the commission shall by resolution fix a time and place at which the owners of the property to be assessed, or any other persons interested therein, may appear and be heard as to the propriety and advisability of constructing such project and, if applicable, providing such services, as to the cost thereof, as to the manner of payment therefor, and as to the amount thereof to be assessed against each property so improved. Ten days' prior notice in writing of such time and place shall be given to such property owners. The notice shall include the amount of the current installment of the assessment and shall be served by mailing a copy to each of such property owners at his last known address. The names and addresses of such property owners shall be obtained from the records of the property appraiser or from such other sources as the city clerk or city engineer deems reliable, proof of such mailing to be made by affidavit of the city clerk or deputy city clerk, or by the city engineer, such proof to be filed with the city clerk; provided, that failure to mail such notice or notices shall not invalidate any of the proceedings hereunder. Notice of the time and place of such hearing shall also be given by two publications a week apart in a newspaper of general circulation in the city; provided, that the last publication shall be at least one week prior to the date of the hearing. Such notice shall describe the streets or other areas to be improved, and shall advise all persons interested that the description of each property to be assessed and the amount to be assessed to each piece or parcel of property may be ascertained at the office of the city clerk, and shall set forth the time and place at which the commission shall meet as an assessment equalization board. Such service by publication shall be verified by the affidavit of the publisher filed with the city clerk. Such hearing shall be before the commission or, if so determined by the commission, before one or more special masters appointed by the commission. If one or more special masters are so appointed, then such special masters shall meet at the time and place named in the notice required above to hear and consider any and all complaints as to the special assessments, and shall recommend to the commission such adjustments and equalizations as shall in their opinion be just and right. 
(8)  Equalizing board to hear complaints and adjust assessments; adjustment of difference in cost and assessment. At the time and place named in the notice specified in subsection (7) above, the commission shall meet as an equalizing board to hear and consider any and all complaints as to the variable assessments and the recommendation of the special masters, if any, and shall adjust and equalize the variable assessments on a basis of justice and right. When so equalized and approved by resolution of the commission, a final assessment roll shall be filed with the city clerk, and such assessments shall stand confirmed and remain legal, valid, and binding first liens upon the property against which such assessments are made until paid, subject to adjustment as provided below. The adoption of such resolution by the commission shall constitute a legislative determination that all property assessed derives a special benefit from the projects and/or services to be construed and/or provided, and that the assessments are fairly and reasonably apportioned among the properties that receive the special benefit. Upon completion of a project, the city shall add to or credit against each current and future assessment installment, the proportionate amount of any unspent funds held or any funds needed to pay such costs. Promptly after such confirmation, the assessments shall be recorded by the city clerk in the official records of the county, and such record of the liens shall constitute prima facie evidence of their validity. 
(d)  Priority of lien; interest; and method of payment. The special assessments shall be payable at the time and in the manner stipulated in the resolution providing for the project or, if applicable, the services; shall remain liens, coequal with the lien of all state, county, district and municipal taxes, but superior in dignity to all other liens, titles, and claims, until paid; shall bear interest, at a rate not to exceed one percent above the rate of interest at which the obligations issued to finance a project are sold, from the date of final acceptance of the project; and may, by such resolution and only for projects, be made payable in equal installments over a period not to exceed 30 years, to which, if not paid when due, there shall be added a penalty at the rate of one percent per month, until paid. 
(e)  Legal proceedings instituted upon failure of property owner to pay special assessment or interest when due; foreclosure; service of process. Each annual assessment installment shall be paid upon the dates specified in such resolution, with interest upon all deferred payments, until the entire amount of the assessment has been paid, and upon the failure of any property owner to pay any annual installment due, or any part thereof, or any annual interest upon deferred payments, the commission shall cause to be brought the necessary legal proceedings to enforce payment thereof with all accrued interest and penalties, together with all legal costs incurred, including reasonable attorneys' and legal assistants' fees, to be assessed as part of the costs. In the event of default in the payment of any installment of an assessment, or any accrued interest on such assessment, the whole assessment, with the interest and penalties thereon, shall immediately become due and payable and subject to foreclosure. In the foreclosure of any special assessment, service of process against unknown or nonresident defendants may be had by publication, as provided by law. The foreclosure proceedings shall be prosecuted to a sale and conveyance of the property involved in such proceedings as now provided by law in suits to foreclose mortgages; or, in the alternative, such proceeding may be instituted and prosecuted under F.S. ch. 173, or as otherwise provided by law. 
(f)  Uniform method of levy, collection and enforcement. If the city elects to use the uniform method for the levy, collection and enforcement of the special assessments, as specified by F.S. § 197.3632 or F.S. § 197.3635 (1997), or any successor provisions of law (collectively, the "uniform method"), the levy, collection and enforcement provisions of the uniform method shall control and be used to the extent they are inconsistent with the provisions of this article. 
(g)  Commission required to make new assessments until valid assessment is made if special assessment is omitted or held invalid. If any special assessment made under the provisions of this article shall be either in whole or in part annulled, vacated or set aside by the judgment of any court, or if the commission shall be satisfied that any such assessment is so irregular or defective that the same cannot be enforced or collected, or if the commission shall have omitted to make such assessment when it might have done so, the commission shall take all necessary steps to cause a new assessment to be made for the whole or any part of any project or, if applicable, any services, or against any property benefitted by any project, or, if applicable, any services, following as nearly as may be the provisions of this article, and in case such second assessment shall be annulled, the commission may obtain and make other assessments until a valid assessment shall be made. 
(h)  Assessment roll sufficient evidence of assessment and other proceedings of this article; variance not material unless party objecting materially injured thereby. Any informality or irregularity in the proceedings in connection with the levy of any special assessment under the provisions of this article shall not affect the validity of the special assessment where the assessment roll has been confirmed by the commission. The assessment roll as finally approved and confirmed shall be competent and sufficient evidence that the assessment was duly levied, that the assessment was duly made and adopted, and that all other proceedings adequate to the adoption of the assessment roll were duly had, taken and performed as required by this article, and no variance from the directions hereunder shall be held material unless it be clearly shown that the party objecting was materially injured thereby. However, nothing in this section shall relieve the commission or the city clerk from notifying the affected property owners of the special assessments as required by this article. 
(i)  Special assessment bonds; project sinking fund. After the adoption of the resolution described in either subsection (b)(2) or (c)(3) above, the city may by ordinance authorize the issuance of obligations in an amount not in excess of the aggregate amount of the estimated benefits to be derived by the property specially benefitted by a project. A special fund, known as "Project Sinking Fund, Series _____," shall be used for the payment of the principal, redemption and/or mandatory purchase premium and interest on such obligations. All the proceeds collected by the city with respect to the special assessment liens for the project shall be deposited and held in such fund. Any surplus remaining after payment of all such obligations shall revert to the city and be used for any lawful purpose. 
(j)  Additional provisions. The city is hereby authorized to finance multiple projects with a single issuance of obligations, and to issue such obligations prior to the equalization, approval and confirmation of the levying of the special assessments for projects. The city shall not be required to let contracts for any projects before enactment of any ordinance authorizing the issuance of obligations. It shall not be necessary for specially benefitted property to connect to any utility projects before assessments may be collected therefor, as long as connections are available from the city. The city clerk shall not be required to certify in regard to any obligations that the amount of assessment liens levied as security for any obligations are equal to the amount of the obligations. All assessment plats, plans and specifications, cost estimates and records of the names and addresses of the owners of property to be assessed shall be kept and maintained by the public works or other similar department of the city, or such other office or officer of the city as may be specified by the commission from time to time. Any special assessment liens upon real property, resulting from special assessments levied pursuant to the provisions of this article, and not as a result of election by the city of the uniform method or for annually recurring services, shall be extinguished upon the recording by the city clerk in the official records of the county, an affidavit or affidavits executed by the mayor of the city to the effect that sufficient security has been deposited with the city in order to insure timely payment of the amounts of such special assessments or the installments thereof, as the case may be. If notes are issued in anticipation of the issuance of obligations, the special assessment shall bear interest at a rate not to exceed one percent above the rate of interest on the notes, as long as the notes are outstanding. Any special assessment installments that are prepaid as authorized by law, shall bear interest at the rate borne by the obligations or the notes issued in anticipation of the issuance of the obligations, whichever are outstanding, and, if necessary to pay additional expenses of redemption and/or mandatory purchase, shall include a prepayment fee not to exceed the applicable redemption and/or mandatory purchase premium, if any, for such notes or obligations, if they were to be redeemed and/or tendered for purchase on the next available redemption and/or mandatory tender for purchase date. 
(k)  Project amendment. Before or after the issuance of obligations as described in this section, the project or projects for which such obligations are authorized may be amended or substituted by the amendment of the article authorizing the obligations. If such amendment shall involve a change in the location or nature of any project, or a change in the benefitted property or in the amount of such benefit, the commission shall, before or after the amendment to the article, proceed to amend the assessment roll and record the appropriate notations in the official records of the county. The procedures set forth in subsection (b) or (c) above, as appropriate, shall be followed in making such amendment to the assessment roll and the official records of the county. The special assessments levied as a result of such amendment or substitution of projects, together with the special assessments previously levied and not amended or substituted, shall be not less than the amount necessary to provide for payment of the principal, interest and applicable redemption and/or mandatory purchase premium with respect to the obligations.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2248, § 1, adopted March 24, 1998, amended art. IV in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former art. IV, §§ 90-81-90-91, 90-101-90-104, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Code 1960, §§ 24-26-24-37, 24-39-24-41.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 90-81. - Short title. 
    This article may be cited as the "Winter Park Newsrack Code." 
(Ord. No. 2248, § 1, 3-24-98) 
Sec. 90-82. - Intent and purpose. 
    The city commission finds and declares that: 
(1)  Findings. 
a.  The uncontrolled placement and maintenance of newsracks in public rights-of-way present an inconvenience and danger to the safety and welfare of persons using such rights-of-way; including pedestrians, persons entering and leaving vehicles and buildings, and persons performing essential utility, traffic control and emergency services. 
b.  Newsracks so located as to cause an inconvenience or danger to persons using public rights-of-way, and unsightly newsracks located therein, constitute public nuisances. 
c.  It is a matter of public necessity that the city protect children and unconsenting adults in and on its public streets, sidewalks, transportation facilities and other public rights-of-way from viewing public displays of offensive sexual material. Such displays are thrust indiscriminately upon unwilling audiences of adults and children and constitute assaults upon individual privacy. 
d.  These factors constitute an unreasonable interference with and obstruction of the use of public rights-of-way, constitute an unwarranted invasion of individual privacy, are injurious to health, offensive to the senses, and constitute such an obstruction of the free use of property as to interfere in the comfortable enjoyment of life and property by the entire community. 
e.  The city commission recognizes, however, that the use of such rights-of-way is so historically associated with the sale and distribution of newspapers and publications that access to those areas for such purposes should not be absolutely denied. The city commission further finds that these strong and competing interests require a reasonable accommodation which can only be satisfactorily achieved through the means of this article which is designed to accommodate such interests regulating the time, place and manner of using such newsracks. 
(2)  Purpose. The provisions and prohibitions hereinafter contained and enacted are in pursuance of and for the purpose of securing and promoting the public health, morals, and general welfare of persons in the city in their use of public rights-of-way through the regulation of placement, appearance, number, size, and servicing of newsracks on the public rights-of-way so as to: 
a.  Provide for pedestrian and driving safety and convenience; 
b.  Ensure no unreasonable interference with the flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic, including ingress to, or egress from, any place of business or from the street to the sidewalk; 
c.  Provide reasonable access for the use and maintenance of sidewalks, poles, posts, traffic signs and signals, hydrants, mailboxes and similar appurtenances, and access to locations used for public transportation purposes; 
d.  Reduce visual blight on the public rights-of-way, protect the aesthetics and value of surrounding properties, and protect the quiet of residential areas; 
e.  Reduce exposure of the city to personal injury or property damage claims and litigation; and 
f.  Protect the right to distribute information protected by the federal and state constitutions through use of newsracks. 
(3)  Preservation of constitutional rights. It is not the intent of this article to in any way discriminate against, regulate, or interfere with the publication, circulation, distribution, or dissemination of any printed material that is constitutionally protected. 
(Ord. No. 2248, § 1, 3-24-98)

(a)  Any person desiring to place or maintain vegetation or improvements on, over, or under any public right-of-way, public way or public property, must apply in writing for and obtain from the public works department a permit for the placement or maintenance of vegetation or improvements therein. The application to be provided must: 
(1)  Be on a form prescribed by the public works department; 
(2)  Be signed by the applicant; 
(3)  Be accompanied by four copies of a drawing indicating the type of vegetation or improvement to be placed or maintained on, over, or under the public right-of-way, public way or public property and the location thereof, including all dimensions, the applicable boundaries of the property in question and the public right-of-way, public way or public property; and

(b)  The application and supporting documentation shall be reviewed by the public works department, in conjunction with any other applicable department. A permit will only be granted if the public works department makes a determination that the requested item: (1) will not create visual blight; (2) will not pose a safety hazard to the traveling public; (3) will not diminish or interfere with the function, maintenance, or operation of the public right-of-way, public way or public property; (4) will be compatible with the existing utilities, the movement of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, community aesthetics, and public safety; and (5) will not otherwise harm the health, safety, or welfare of the community. For purposes of this article, it is a rebuttable presumption that any vegetation or improvement placed or maintained on, over, or under the public right-of-way, public way or public property constitutes a harm to the public health, safety or welfare. 
(c)  The public works department, after consulting with any other applicable department, shall notify the applicant in writing as to whether the application was approved or denied.

(e)  Every permitted item placed on, over, or under the public right-of-way, public way, or public property shall be so placed and maintained subject to the following conditions and requirements: 
(1)  The city reserves the right to remove any and all vegetation or improvements on, over, or under the public right-of-way, public way, or public property, with or without notice and with or without cause. If removal without notice by the city is required, the actual cost thereof shall be borne by the city, provided the removal was not the result of an emergency. In the event notice is given by the city for the removal of the item or in the event such removal is a result of an emergency, the city may assess the costs of such removal to the applicant or his successor. Under no circumstances shall the city be responsible for the replacement of or the cost of any vegetation or improvement placed or maintained on, over, or under the public right-of-way, public way, or public property. 
(2)  The applicant or his successors shall not assert the existence of any vested rights on, over, or under the public right-of-way, public way, or public property, nor shall such rights be granted or otherwise exist, it being the intent that such permit shall only create a revocable license, which license is revocable at will by the city. 
(3)  Issuance of a permit by the city shall not be construed by the applicant or his successors as a warranty that the placement and maintenance of an item on, over, or under the public right-of-way, public way, or public property is in compliance with any applicable rules, regulations or laws not provided for in this article, it being the express intent of this article that any placement or maintenance of vegetation or improvement on, over, or under the public right-of-way, public way, or public property shall be subject to the city code and other regulations of the city pertaining thereto. 
(4)  The applicant or his successor shall use all proper and reasonable care in connection with the placement and maintenance of any vegetation or improvement on, over, or under the public right-of-way, public way, or public property in order to prevent harm, damage or injury to persons or property therefrom.

DIVISION 2. - UTILITY SERVICE 

Sec. 94-76. - Levy of tax; when payable. 
(a)  There is imposed and levied by the city a tax upon each and every purchase of electricity, metered or bottled gas (natural, liquefied petroleum or manufactured) and water service within the corporate limits of the city in the amount of ten percent of each payment received by the seller for such utility service or commodity. Such tax shall be paid by the purchaser to the seller, for the use of the city, at the time of paying the charge therefor, but not less often than monthly. 
(b)  There is imposed and levied by the city a tax upon each and every purchase of telecommunications service which originates and terminates in this state at a rate of seven percent of the total amount charged for any telecommunications service provided within the city or, if the location of the telecommunications service provided cannot be determined as part of the billing process, the total amount billed for such telecommunications service to a telephone or telephone number, a telecommunications number or device, a service address, or a customer's billing address located within the city, excluding public telephone charges collected onsite, charges for any foreign exchange service or any private line service except when such services are used or sold as a substitute for any telephone company switched service or dedicated facility by which a telephone company provides a communication path, access charges and any customer access line charges paid to a local telephone company. However, telecommunications service as defined in F.S. § 203.012(5)(b) shall be taxed only on the monthly recurring customer service charges excluding variable usage charges.

(Code 1960, § 26-1; Ord. No. 2231, § 1, 12-9-97) 
Sec. 94-77. - Duty of seller to collect tax; failure of purchaser to pay bill. 
(a)  It shall be the duty of every seller of electricity, metered or bottled gas (natural, liquefied petroleum or manufactured), and water service within the city to collect from the purchaser, for the use of the city, the tax levied under this division at the time of collecting the selling price thereof and to report and pay over, on or before the 15th day of each calendar month, unto the city, all such taxes levied and collected during the preceding calendar month. 
(b)  It shall be the duty of every seller of telecommunications service within the city to collect from the purchaser, for the use of the city, the tax levied under this division at the time of collecting the selling price thereof. Every seller of telecommunications service shall file a return with the city each month, which return shall identify the name and address of the seller, the period of the return, the amount collected from the sale of telecommunications services, any collection allowance taken, the amount of tax remitted with the return, and the name and telephone number of a person authorized by the seller to respond to inquiries from the city concerning the seller's administration of the tax. The seller shall report and pay over unto the city all such taxes levied and collected on the date returns and payments of tax are required under F.S. ch. 212. The city may grant an extension of the due date for a return or payment upon written request from the seller. In the event the total amount of tax anticipated to be collected by seller of telecommunications service within a calendar quarter does not exceed $120.00, the seller of such telecommunications service may, with the written authorization of the city, remit the taxes collected during such calendar quarter to the city quarterly. In such case, the tax shall be due on or before the 20th day of the month following the end of the calendar quarter in which the taxes were collected. 
(c)  It shall be unlawful for any seller to collect for any such service without, at the same time, collecting the tax levied, unless such seller shall elect to assume and pay such tax without collecting the tax from the purchaser. Any seller failing to collect such tax at the time of collecting for any such service, where the seller has not elected to assume and pay such tax, shall be liable to the city for the amount of such tax; provided, however, that the seller shall not be liable for the payment of such tax upon uncollected bills. If any purchaser shall fail, neglect or refuse to pay for any such service, including the tax imposed, the seller shall have the right and is authorized and empowered to immediately discontinue further service to such purchaser until the bill is paid in full. 
(d)  For the purpose of compensating the seller of telecommunications service, the seller shall be allowed one percent of the amount of the tax collected and due to the city upon a timely filed return in the form of a deduction from the amount collected for remittance. The deduction shall be allowed as compensation for the keeping of records and for the collection of and the remitting of the tax on a timely basis. The deduction shall not be allowed in the event of an untimely return, unless the seller has in writing requested and been granted an extension of time for filing its return. Extensions of time shall be granted if reasonable cause is shown, whether requested before or after the due date of the return. 
(Code 1960, § 26-2; Ord. No. 2029, § 1, 1-25-94; Ord. No. 2231, § 2, 12-9-97) 
Sec. 94-78. - Records kept by seller; auditing; interest and penalties. 
(a)  Each and every seller of electricity, metered or bottled gas (natural, liquefied petroleum or manufactured), water service and telecommunications service shall keep complete records showing all sales in the city of such commodities or service, which records shall show the price charged upon each sale, the date thereof and the date of payment and the seller shall retain all records kept in the ordinary course of business which establish the collection and remittance of taxes due. Each seller shall preserve the records relating to such taxes until the expiration of the time within which the city may make any assessment with respect to that tax. 
(b)  Pursuant to F.S. § 166.234, upon 60 days' written notice to audit transmitted to the seller by certified mail, return receipt requested, each such seller must provide the city access to such records which shall be kept open for inspection by the duly authorized agents of the city during the seller's normal business hours at the official location of the seller's books and records. Duly authorized agents of the city shall have the right, power and authority to make any transcripts thereof during such times as they may desire. Upon reasonable request, the city must grant an extension of the due date by which the records must be made available for inspection. If either the city or the seller requires an additional extension, it must give notice to the other no less than 30 days before the existing extension expires, except in cases of bona fide emergency or waiver of the notice requirement by the other party. Any information received by the city or its agent in connection with such audit is confidential and exempt from the provisions of F.S. § 119.07(1). 
(c)  If the seller received timely notice requesting access to such records and the seller failed or refused to allow such access and did not propose an alternative date on which the audit was to commence, or if the seller and the city agreed in writing to an alternative date on which the audit was to commence but the seller then failed or refused to permit reasonable access to its books and records on the alternative date, the seller shall reimburse the city the reasonable travel expenses incurred by or charged to the city in connection with performing the audit. 
(d)  Interest shall be assessed at the rate of one percent per month of the delinquent tax from the date the tax was due until paid. In the event of willful neglect, or willful negligence, a penalty shall be assessed at the rate of five percent per month of the delinquent tax, not to exceed a total penalty of 25 percent. In no event will the penalty for failure to file a return be less than $15.00. In the case of a fraudulent return or a willful intent to evade payment of the tax, the seller making such fraudulent return or willfully attempting to evade payment of the tax, shall be liable for a specific penalty of 100 percent of the tax. Interest and penalties shall be computed on the net tax due after application of any overpayments. A seller's liability for any tax, interest or penalty may be settled or compromised by the city pursuant to F.S. § 166.234(14), upon the grounds of doubt as to liability or doubt as to the collectibility of such tax, interest, or penalty. 
(e)  The city shall prepare and furnish to the seller a report of each audit which identifies the nature of any deficiency or overpayment, the amount thereof, and the manner in which the amount was computed. Upon a finding of deficiency or overpayment, the city shall issue a determination which states the amounts of tax, interest, and penalty which the city determines is owed or due the seller together with a written narrative explanation of the basis for the city's determinations. The determination shall also inform the seller of the remedies available to it if the seller disagrees with any such determination, list the name of the person authorized by the city to approve compromises and execute closing agreements settling a dispute, and state the consequences of the seller's failure to comply with any demand of the city which is stated in the determination. A seller may file with the city a written protest of any determination within 60 days after the determination is issued. The city shall consider the protest and issue a written notice of its decision to the seller within 60 days which addresses each issue raised in the protest. The seller may petition the city for reconsideration of a notice of decision within 30 days after the issuance of the notice, and the city shall issue a written notice of reconsideration to the seller within 30 days which addresses each issue raised in the petition. 
(f)  A determination becomes final 60 days after the date of issuance, unless the seller, before the 60-day period expires, has filed a protest or secured a written extension of time within which to file a protest. If the seller has secured a written extension of time and fails to file a protest within the extended time period, the proposed assessment becomes a final assessment at the expiration of the extended filing period. If a protest is timely filed and the seller and the city are unable to resolve the disputed issues, the determination becomes final as of the date of issuance of the notice of decision, unless the seller timely files a petition for reconsideration. If a petition for reconsideration is timely filed, the determination becomes final upon issuance of a notice of reconsideration. 
(g)  The city may issue a proposed assessment of tax levied under section 94-76 within three years after the date the tax was due. However, this limitation is tolled for one year if within the three-year period the city issues to the seller a notice of intent to audit. If the audit cannot be completed prior to the expiration of this limitation period as extended by tolling, and such condition is due to the seller's refusal or delay in allowing access to applicable records, the city may make a proposed assessment from an estimate based upon the best information available for the taxable period, unless the seller agrees in writing to extend the limitations period. The city may also make a proposed assessment from such an estimate if, notwithstanding agreed extensions of the limitations period to a date which is three years following issuance of the notice of intent to audit, the seller does not allow access to applicable records prior to such date. 
(h)  A seller may apply to the city for refund for, or may take a credit for, any overpayment of tax or interest or penalty thereon within three years following remittance by the seller, and the city must refund or allow the seller credit for such overpayments as were remitted to the city. However, in the case of an overpayment which the seller has previously refunded or credited to a purchaser, the limitation period for the seller's refund application or credit shall expire three years following the seller's remittance to the city or 60 days following the seller's issuance of the refund or credit to the purchaser, whichever is later. 
(i)  Upon expiration of the periods set forth in this provision, the city's right to assess tax, interest, or penalty and the seller's right to apply for a refund or credit expire and are barred, unless fraud has occurred; however, sellers and the city may enter into agreements to extend these periods.

Sec. 102-115.07. - Grease traps and interceptors. 
(a)  Permit required. Any food service facility that intends to erect, install, remove, convert or replace any grease trap or interceptor is required by section 102-98 "Renewal of Occupational License Subject to Adequate Pollution Control Facilities" of the City of Winter Park Code to make application to the building official and obtain the required permit. The facility shall submit with its permit application the appropriate design criteria in accordance with the Florida Building Code - Plumbing, as amended (current edition). 
(b)  Requirements. All food service facilities are required to have a grease interceptor or trap properly installed in accordance with any and all applicable requirements of the Florida Building Code - Plumbing, as amended (current edition). 
(1)  New facilities. On or after the effective date of the City of Winter Park Grease Management Ordinance, food service facilities which are newly proposed or constructed, or existing food service facilities which will be expanded or renovated to include a food service facility, where such a food service facility did not previously exist, shall be required to install a grease interceptor or trap according to the requirements of the Florida Building Code - Plumbing, as amended (current edition) and to operate and maintain the grease interceptor or trap according to the requirements contained in this ordinance. 
(2)  Existing facilities. Food service facilities existing prior to the date of the City of Winter Park Grease Management Ordinance shall be permitted to operate and maintain existing grease interceptors or traps provided their grease interceptors or traps are in good operating condition. 
The City may require an existing facility to install a new grease interceptor or trap that complies with the requirements of the Florida Building Code - Plumbing, as amended (current edition) or to modify or repair any noncompliant plumbing or existing grease interceptor or trap when any one or more of the following conditions exist: 
a.  The facility is found to be contributing grease in quantities sufficient to cause line stoppages or necessitate increased maintenance on the wastewater collection system. 
b.  Grease concentrations exceed 100 mg/l on wastewater effluent as determined by sampling performed by the IW inspector. 
c.  The facility exceeds CBOD, TSS and grease concentrations continually for six months resulting in surcharges for excessive discharge. 
d.  The facility does not have a grease interceptor or trap. 
e.  The facility has a defective grease interceptor or trap. 
f.  Remodeling of the food preparation or kitchen waste plumbing system is performed which requires a plumbing permit to be issued by the City of Winter Park. 
g.  The facility is sold or undergoes a change of ownership. 
h.  The facility does not have plumbing connections to a grease interceptor or trap in compliance with the requirements of this ordinance. 
(c)  Plumbing connections. Grease interceptors or traps shall be installed in accordance with Florida Building Code - Plumbing, as amended (current edition). Wastewater from sanitary facilities shall not be introduced into the grease interceptor or trap under any circumstances. 
(d)  Grease trap/interceptor tank sizing. Any fixture that has the potential to introduce organic waste, grease, oil or fat into the sanitary sewer system shall be connected to grease interceptor/trap (mop sink, floor sink/drain, floor cleanout, trench drain, prep sink, three-compartment sink, dishwasher, soda or beer run-off, etc.). Per Florida Plumbing Code, hand sinks are not required to be connected to a grease trap/interceptor. 
(1)  Interior grease trap requirements and sizing: 
Proposed and future seating capacity (interior and exterior) shall not exceed 40 seats. 
1.  Calculate the capacity of the device in cubic inches: 
(Width) ×(Depth) × (Height) = Cu. In. 
2.  Convert the capacity from cubic inches to gallons per minute (GPM): 
Cu. In. ÷ 231 = GPM 
3.  Adjust for displacement: 
GPM × 0.75 = GPM 
* Result is the flow rate required to drain the sink in one minute and the alternate two minute calculation is not accepted. 
(2)  Exterior grease interceptor sizing: 
(S) x (GS) x (HR/12) x (LF) = Effective capacity of Grease Trap in Gallons 
S=Total Seating Number 
GS= 18.75 (Gallon values reflect the private use 25% reduction) 
HR= Hours of operation/12 
LF= (2.0 Interstate Highway, 1.5 other freeway, 1.25 recreational area, 1.0 main highway, 0.75 other roads) 
(3)  [Alternate trap or interceptor.] In the event the city declares an exterior grease trap or interceptor cannot be installed due to space limitations, the owner may be permitted to use an alternate trap or interceptor. The trap must perform with the same principle as a full size interceptor or trap. The owner will also be required to prove the trap can adequately accept and treat the waste stream generated from the owner's facility without exceeding the CBOD, TSS and oil limits. 
(e)  Records maintenance. Each food service facility shall maintain a bound log book in which a record of all interceptor maintenance is entered.

Permit holders shall be informed of any proposed changes in their respective permits at least 60 days prior to the effective date of change and shall be allowed a comment period relating to any of the proposed changes in their permits within the first 30 days after issuance of such proposed change by the city. The city shall allow a discharger a reasonable period of time to comply with any changes in the permit required by the city, unless otherwise required by emergency or governmental regulations. The permit holder may petition the city for modification of permit based on changed conditions. The director shall review such petitions with support data and take appropriate action. 
(j)  Transferability. A separate permit shall be required for each wastewater connection discharging, directly or indirectly, into the sewage system. For each discharger having multiple connections at a single plant or facility, a single permit shall be required which may set forth specific effluent limitations and conditions for discharge from each separate connection. Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific user for a specific operation. A wastewater discharge permit shall not be assigned or transferred or sold to a new owner, new user or for different premises, unless approved by the director, and any such attempted assignment, transfer or sale shall be void and of no effect.

Sec. 102-117. - Control manholes. 
(a)  The owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole, together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastes. 
(b)  Such manhole shall be accessibly and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the director. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times. The owner shall install such manhole within 30 days from the date the lateral connection is made to the sewer. If such manhole is not installed within the time provided, the city shall have the right to enter into a contract for the installation of the manhole at the owner's expense, and the cost of installing the manhole, together with the administrative cost to the city necessary to process the installation of the manhole, shall be chargeable to the owner, and, if not paid within 30 days from the date such installation is completed, the unpaid costs together with lawful interest thereon shall be a lien upon the property wherein the user is situated. The city shall be entitled to institute foreclosure proceedings for the collection of the unpaid costs and interest thereon, such proceedings to be in accordance with law, and the city shall be entitled to collect reasonably attorneys' fees from the owner for services rendered by the city's attorneys in the institution and prosecution of such foreclosure proceedings. 
(c)  Liens created under this section shall, upon the request of the user or owner of the property affected and upon payment of all installation and administrative costs and lawful interest thereon, be released by a certificate signed by the city manager or the city finance director and bearing the seal of the city. The issuance of such certificate shall constitute prima facie evidence of existence or nonexistence of any such unpaid costs, and shall, in the absence of fraud perpetrated by the party requesting the certificate, be binding upon the city as to the existence and nonexistence of any lien created under this section. 
(Code 1960, § 22-5(8); Ord. No. 2988-15 , § 2(Exh. A), 2-9-15) 
Sec. 102-118. - Measurements, tests and analyses. 
    All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this article shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, from suitable samples taken at the control manhole. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analysis involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or other multiple samples should be taken. 
(Code 1960, § 22-5(9)) 
Sec. 102-119. - Special agreements. 
    No statement contained in this article shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor by the industrial concern. 
(Code 1960, § 22-5(10)) 
Sec. 102-120. - Frequency of measurements. 
    The industrial wastewater discharge permit holder shall make measurements, including but not limited to flow rates, flow volumes, BOD and suspended solids concentrations as well as concentrations of other particular constituents of their industrial wastewater discharges, at their own expense, as frequently as necessary to comply with the terms and conditions of each permit. Should measurements or other investigations indicate that the industrial user has discharged wastewater which has constituents significantly different in quantity or quality from those stated by the discharger, the city shall notify and require the discharger to furnish all information in his possession relevant to the apparent variance. 
(Code 1960, § 22-5(11)) 
Sec. 102-121. - Spill containment plan. 
    All industrial users who pose a threat to the normal operation of the sewer works, process, equipment or receiving waters shall be required to establish a spill containment plan. This plan shall contain the following elements: 
(1)  Accidental discharges. Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this article. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review and shall be approved by the city before construction of the facility. All existing users shall complete such a plan by the date as specified by the industrial wastewater discharge permit. No new user who begins discharge to the POTW after the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved. 
(2)  Telephone notification. Any person causing or suffering any discharge, whether accidental or not, which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health and welfare of persons, to the environment or which is likely to cause interference with the POTW shall notify the director immediately by telephone. In the absence or unavailability of the director, notification shall be given to the city employee then in charge of the treatment works. 
(3)  Written report. Within five days following such occurrence, the user shall provide the director with a detailed written report describing the cause of the dangerous discharge and measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills or any other damage to persons or property nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law. Furthermore, the industrial user shall control its production (or all its discharges) to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with all applicable city, state and federal regulations upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility and until the facility is completely restored or an alternative and equally effective method of pretreatment is provided. This applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
(4)  Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call if a dangerous discharge occurs. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure.

(Code 1960, § 22-10) 
Sec. 102-132. - Schedule of fees. 
(a)  Established. There is established a uniform schedule of fees for the use or availability for use, as provided in sections 102-93 and 102-94, of the services and facilities of the sanitary sewer system payable by each dwelling unit, business establishment, church, hospital and every other type of private or public building, structure or activity producing sewage and wastes. As required by federal regulations, this fee schedule shall be reviewed no less than every two years to ensure that sufficient revenues are being generated to pay the total operation and maintenance costs of the sewer system including replacement and to ensure that each user class is paying its proportionate share of such costs based on the proportionate contribution of the user class to the total wastewater loading from all user classes. Furthermore, each user shall be notified at least annually in conjunction with a regular bill of the rate and that portion of the user charge which is attributable to wastewater treatment services. 
(b)  Definitions. Unless the context specifically provides otherwise, the meaning of terms used in this section shall be as follows: 
    Dwelling unit means a house, apartment, group of rooms or a single room occupied or intended for occupancy as separate living quarters. Separate living quarters are those in which the occupants do not live and eat with any other persons in the structure, and which quarters have either:

(d)  Outside city rates. Outside city rates shall be 125 percent of the inside city rates, as reflected in the above tables. 
(e)  Maximum usage charge, residential. The maximum monthly sewer charge for residential customers shall not exceed an amount computed on the basis of 12,000 gallons of metered water consumption per dwelling unit. The usage charge is in addition to the monthly readiness-to-serve charge for the water meter currently in use. If there is an inoperative meter, a maximum usage charge may be established by the superintendent in order to facilitate billing the sewer usage charge to the customer. For residential and multiple dwelling units served by a single water meter which have separate water meters for irrigation purposes for which the sewage usage charge is not billed or for which a non-metered alternative water source (e.g., lake or well) is used for irrigation purposes, there shall be no maximum usage charge associated with nonirrigation water use. 
(f)  Applicability. Rates and charges provided for in this section shall not apply to water billings for such meters as have been determined by the city to have no relationship to the use of the sanitary sewer system. Such determination shall be based upon an application submitted by the user to the city, which application shall be accompanied by evidence that the water passing through such water meter is not connected to the sanitary sewer system and is not connected to septic tanks in areas where the sanitary sewer system is available as defined in this article. 
(g)  Rates for persons deemed users but not connected to system. For persons deemed users in accordance with section 102-133 but who are not connected to any line of the sanitary sewer system, the monthly rate shall be equivalent to the readiness-to-serve charge for service both inside the city or outside the city. 
(h)  Billing frequency. The city manager is authorized to bill users either monthly or quarterly. Quarterly fees shall be determined by multiplying the minimum and maximum monthly fees or usage requirements by three, with the sewer usage fee per 1,000 gallons of metered water being the same as for monthly billing. 
(i)  Adjustment of rates. In order to ensure that the city derives sufficient revenue to offset future changes in operation and maintenance charges for sewage disposal at treatment plants now owned by the city, the rates per 1,000 gallons of water consumed shall be adjusted, if approved by a majority of the city commission, to incorporate any change in the operation and maintenance costs billed to the city for the use of such plants. The city manager shall be responsible for computing the necessary adjustment and advising the city commission of its magnitude immediately upon being informed of a change in these charges. The adjusted rate shall take effect no sooner than the date charges to the city are increased or 30 days after the city commission is notified of the pending increase, whichever occurs later. 
(j)  Automatic index adjustment. The rates established in subsection (c) above for sewer service shall be adjusted annually, on or before October 1 of each year, in accordance with the Florida Public Service Commission Deflator Index. The automatic index adjustment shall be determined on an annual basis and shall be applied to such sewer rates and charges which are in effect immediately prior to the effective date of each such automatic annual adjustment. The effective date of the adjusted sewer rates and charges shall be October 1 of each year unless the city commission, after public hearing, determines that the automatic index adjustment is not necessary for the fiscal soundness of the sanitary sewer system.

(Code 1960, § 22-12) 
Sec. 102-134. - Collections; penalties for nonpayment. 
(a)  An initial deposit shall be required as set forth in this section at the time the property is first connected to the water or sewer system or when an owner or tenant has previously failed to pay water, sewer or sanitation service fees due the city within the time limits established in this article. All commercial accounts will be required to place and maintain a deposit in either the amount stated in this section or in an amount equal to three months average billing, whichever is greater. Deposits required by this section are a guarantee that all sums of money due to the city for service furnished to the user making such deposit will be fully paid. Upon the payment of all such sums the city shall, upon the discontinuance of service, refund to the person making such deposit the amount of such deposit less any water, sewer and sanitation fees and penalties still due the city. Deposits shall be returned to residential customers making the deposit after two years of service if the user has not been delinquent in making timely water, sewer and sanitation sewer fee payments to the city.

(b)  Nonpayment of fees is declared to be a violation of this article. Nonpayment of fees for owner- or tenant-occupied property for a period of 25 days after the billing date shall be considered delinquent and shall constitute grounds for the suspension of water service until payment of fees, interest, penalties and any related service charges are made. However, no suspension of water service under this article shall be required by the city except upon written authorization signed by the city manager or his designee. Furthermore, nonpayment of sewer fees for a period of 60 days for owner- or tenant-occupied property shall constitute grounds for the suspension of sewer service, when authorized in writing by the city manager. When sewer service is suspended, the county health department shall be immediately notified. 
(c)  If a representative of the city arrives at the service address to disconnect service for nonpayment and the customer tenders payment instead of having service disconnected, a service charge of $10.00 shall be charged and collected in addition to all past due water, sewer, refuse and related charges. When service is disconnected due to nonpayment, service shall not be reconnected until all past due water, sewer, refuse and related charges and penalties are fully paid, together with a reconnection charge of $25.00. 
(d)  The penalties and remedies contained in this section shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to any and all other penalties and remedies contained in this Code for the violation thereof. 
(Code 1960, § 22-13) 
Sec. 102-135. - Liens. 
(a)  The city shall have a lien on all lands or premises served by its sewer system for all fees and service charges for such sewer facilities until paid, which lien shall be prior to all other liens on such lands or premises, except the lien of state, county and municipal taxes and municipal liens for other municipal services such as water and refuse, and shall be on a parity with the lien of such state, county and municipal taxes and other municipal liens. Such lien shall arise at the time of connection of sewer service to such lands or premises and shall be due and payable at the time of delinquency of any unpaid sewer fees and service charges. Interest shall accrue on unpaid liens at the rate of 12 percent per annum. 
(b)  The city shall be entitled to institute foreclosure proceedings at any time after a lien is attached and is delinquent for a period of 30 days, such proceedings to be in accordance with law, and the city shall be entitled to collect reasonable attorneys' fees from the owner for services rendered by the city's attorneys in the institution and prosecution of such foreclosure proceedings. 
(c)  Liens created under this section shall, upon the request of the user or the owner of the property affected and upon payment of all delinquent fees, including lawful interest thereon, and all penalties imposed, be released by a certificate signed by the city manager or the city finance director and bearing the seal of the city.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 102-156. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    City means the City of Winter Park, Florida, and its staff and elected officials. 
    Department means the city public works department. 
    Drainage area means the watershed (land area) contributing surface water runoff to the city's stormwater drainage system. 
    Dwelling unit means one or more rooms with bathroom and kitchen facilities designed for occupancy by one family. 
    Equivalent residential unit (ERU) means the basic unit for the computation of stormwater utility fees. Single-family and multifamily properties, based on data for the city, have an average impervious area of 2324 square feet. Nonresidential/commercial properties will have ERUs computed using the following formula: 
No. of ERUs =  Impervious Area (Sq. Ft.) / 2324 Sq. Ft. 
    Feepayer means the owner or occupant of real property in the city which contributes stormwater runoff to and which benefits from the city's stormwater management system. 
    Impervious area means any part of any parcel of land that has been modified by the action of persons to reduce the land's natural ability to absorb and hold rainfall. This includes areas which have been cleared, graded, paved, graveled or compacted or covered with structures. Excluded are all lawns, landscape areas and gardens or farming areas. 
    Multifamily residential properties includes all duplex, condominium, apartment and other properties containing more than one dwelling unit. However, retirement and publicly assisted housing complexes shall be treated as nonresidential/commercial properties for calculation of stormwater utility fees. 
    Nonresidential/commercial includes all property zoned or used for commercial, industrial, retail, governmental or other nonresidential purposes and shall include all developed real property in the city not classified as single-family or multifamily as defined in this section. 
    Receiving water means those creeks, streams, lakes, sinkholes and other bodies of water into which surface waters are directed, either naturally or in manmade ditches, pipes or open systems. 
    Single-family property includes all single-family detached housing units. Attached single-family dwellings served by individual water meters shall also be considered under this category. All other residential development shall be classified as multifamily. 
    Stormwater management plan means a plan for receiving, handling, transporting and treating stormwaters and surface waters within the city as adopted by the city commission. 
    Stormwater management system means a system which is designed and constructed or implemented to control discharges which are necessitated by rainfall events, incorporating methods to collect, convey, store, absorb, inhibit, treat, use or reuse water to prevent or reduce flooding, over drainage, environmental degradation and water pollution or otherwise affect the quantity and quality of discharges from the system. The stormwater management system includes all natural and manmade elements used to convey stormwater from the first point of impact with the surface of the earth to a suitable receiving water or location internal or external to the boundaries of the city. The stormwater management system includes all pipes, channels, streams, ditches, wetlands, sinkholes, detention/retention basins, ponds and other stormwater conveyance and treatment facilities, whether public or private. Regardless of whether or not the city shall have recorded rights-of-way or easements, it is presumed that the city has a prescriptive right of access to all stormwater management facilities for operation, maintenance, rehabilitation or replacement.

(Code 1960, § 23B-4) 
Sec. 102-160. - Authority for fees. 
(a)  Generally. The stormwater management utility is empowered by this article to recommend charges for the use of and discharge to the city's stormwater management system. Such charges shall be based on the cost of providing stormwater management services to all properties within the city and may be different for properties receiving different classes of service. The city commission shall adopt and revise from time to time a schedule of stormwater utility fees for stormwater management services to cover funding requirements of utility operations. 
(b)  Rates for stormwater management service. There is levied against all feepayers for all real property in the city which contributes stormwater runoff to and which benefit from the city's stormwater management system a monthly stormwater utility fee in accordance with the following definitions, methodology and schedule: 
(1)  Single-family property utility fees. Single-family residential properties shall be divided into classifications based upon their impervious area, and the rate imposed shall be in accordance with the schedule set out in this article. The classifications shall be made utilizing the impervious area data as reflected in the records of the property appraiser for the county, recognizing that such records do not reflect impervious areas for residential driveways, walks and similar improvements. 
(2)  Multifamily property stormwater utility fees. Each separate apartment, condominium and duplex dwelling unit shall be considered as a class 2 single-family residential unit and the fee imposed shall be equal to the fee charged for such class 2 single-family residential unit. 
(3)  Nonresidential/commercial property: The monthly stormwater utility fee for nonresidential/commercial property shall be charged on the basis of the impervious area on the property in accordance with the following formula: 
Impervious Area (Sq. Ft.) / 2324 Sq. Ft.  = Number of ERUs 
Monthly Service Charge = (No. ERUs) × (Rate/ERU) 
A minimum value of 1.0 ERU shall be assigned to each nonresidential/commercial property. The impervious area of each nonresidential/commercial property shall be determined by the director of public works or his designee. The number of ERUs shall be determined and rounded to the nearest one-tenth of an ERU. The value of 2,324 square feet of impervious area per ERU is an average obtained using data for the city. 
(4)  Application to all developed properties. Stormwater utility fees shall apply to all properties within the city, including those properties classified as nonprofit or tax-exempt for ad valorem tax purposes. It shall apply to all governmental property, including properties of the city, such as city-owned buildings, parks and other properties, but shall not include any public right-of-way. 
(5)  Undeveloped property. Stormwater utility fees shall not be levied against undeveloped property that has not been altered from the natural state as defined under the term "impervious area" under section 102-156. Farmland, gardens and landscaped areas shall also be exempt except for any roads, parking or structures associated therewith. 
(6)  Credits. A feepayer may obtain credit against a portion of the monthly stormwater utility fee by the construction and maintenance of onsite stormwater retention facilities serving the property for which credit is sought or for properties demonstrating that they are not significantly contributing runoff to or benefitting from the city's stormwater management system. Credits shall not be allowed for single-family or multifamily properties. Credits for nonresidential/commercial properties shall not be allowed for stormwater retention facilities which retain less than the first one-half inch of runoff from all impervious surfaces. A credit equal to ten percent of the monthly stormwater utility fee shall be allowed for onsite stormwater retention facilities retaining the first one-half inch of stormwater runoff from onsite impervious surfaces, and a credit equal to 20 percent of the monthly stormwater utility fee shall be allowed for onsite stormwater retention facilities retaining the first one inch or more of stormwater runoff from onsite impervious surfaces. In no event shall the credits allowed under this subsection in the aggregate exceed 50 percent of the monthly stormwater utility fee. 
(c)  Billing. The stormwater utility fees imposed by this article shall be billed in conjunction with the monthly utility bill issued by the city's utility billing section. Such fees shall be due and payable at the same time and in the same manner and subject to the same penalties as other utility fees. If a property shall not have utility service at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this section is derived but is deemed to be contributing runoff to or benefitting from the city's stormwater management system, a new account shall be developed and that property shall be billed separately for the stormwater management charges. 
(Code 1960, § 23B-5) 
Sec. 102-161. - Computation of fees. 
    The amount of the monthly stormwater utility fee shall be determined in accordance with the following fee schedules, with the monthly fee to be charged for each equivalent residential unit (ERU) to be $3.00:

Sec. 102-163. - Appeals. 
(a)  Any feepayer who feels that the stormwater utility fee for his property has been assigned or computed incorrectly may petition in writing to the city manager for a review of the charges. If the property and its use is not specified on the applicable fee schedule, the city manager shall use the fee applicable to the most nearly comparable type of land use on the fee schedule. If the feepayer questions the computation of the stormwater utility fee, the feepayer shall prepare and submit to the city manager an independent fee calculation for the property. The independent fee calculation study shall follow the prescribed methodologies and formats established by this article and any regulations promulgated under this article. Independent fee calculations studies shall be prepared and presented by professionals qualified in their respective fields. The study shall show the basis upon which the independent fee calculation was made, including but not limited to surveys showing the impervious areas, onsite stormwater retention and stormwater detention areas and internal onsite stormwater management systems and engineering studies documenting the stormwater runoff and proposed credits attributable to the property. The city manager shall consider the documentation submitted by the feepayer but is not required to accept such documentation as he shall reasonably deem to be inaccurate, inapplicable or not reliable and may, in the alternative, require the feepayer to submit additional or different documentation for consideration. If an acceptable independent fee calculation study is not presented, the feepayer shall pay the stormwater utility fees based upon the schedules set forth in this article. 
(b)  If not satisfied with the determination of the city manager, the feepayer, by filing a written request with the city manager within ten days of the city manager's determination, may schedule a hearing before the stormwater board of appeals, whose decision shall be final.

(Code 1960, § 23B-8) 
Sec. 102-164. - Delinquent charges; liens. 
    The city shall have a lien upon the property for which the stormwater utility fee is assessed for any and all delinquent or unpaid stormwater management utility fees. Enforcement and foreclosure of the lien shall be as provided by law. The city shall be entitled to collect reasonable attorneys' fees from any feepayer, customer or property owner for services rendered by the city attorney in the collection of such charges or in the institution and prosecution of any foreclosure proceedings.

ARTICLE VI. - ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION 

Sec. 102-206. - Short title. 
    This article shall be known as the "Electric Distribution Franchise Ordinance". 
(Ord. No. 2420-01, § 1, 6-12-01); 
Sec. 102-207. - Findings and legislative intent. 
    The city commission of the City of Winter Park, Florida (the "city") hereby makes the following findings and declares its legislative intent as follows: 
(1)  The city voted to finance its first municipal electric system on February 25, 1913. 
(2)  The city operated its own municipal electric system and purchased power from a neighboring community until May 4, 1927. 
(3)  On April 4 and May 2, 1927, the city entered into a contract to sell its municipal electric system to the Florida Public Service Commission ("FPSC"). 
(4)  On April 4, 1927, the city granted its first electric franchise to FPSC. 
(5)  The electric franchise granted in 1927 contained a franchise purchase option which was a portion of the consideration the city received in return for selling its municipal electric system to FPSC. 
(6)  On June 2, 1947, the city renewed and extended the 1927 franchise for the FPSC's successor in title, Florida Power Corporation. 
(7)  As part of the 1947 franchise agreement, the city again received an option to purchase back the electric system. 
(8)  On January 13, 1971, at Florida Power Corporation's request, the city granted a new 30-year franchise which likewise contained a franchise purchase option in favor of the city. 
(9)  Since that time, Florida Power Corporation has been the exclusive provider of electric service in the city. 
(10)  There is an immediate and continuing need for safe and reliable electric service for individuals, organizations, firms, and entities located within in the city. 
(11)  F.S. § 166.021(1) provides municipalities broad authority, including the governmental, corporate and proprietary powers to enable them to conduct municipal government, perform municipal functions, and render municipal services. Pursuant to this broad home rule authority, the city may, in its sole discretion, make safe, reliable and affordable electric service available to its citizens by means of the construction, operation and maintenance of power generation facilities and associated transmission and distribution systems in and on the roadways and associated easements and rights-of-way of the city and such electric service would provide an economic benefit to the city's inhabitants, property owners and businesses. 
(12)  The city holds the public rights-of-way within its boundaries in trust on behalf of its citizens and has a duty to utilize or permit others to utilize rights-of-way in an appropriate manner while insuring that the city properly manages its resources to the maximum reasonable economic benefit of its citizens. 
(13)  The city is the sole authority empowered to own, operate and maintain the city streets, easements and rights-of-way within the city and structures located thereon and to grant the use of such streets, easements and rights-of-ways to others. 
(14)  The city has a continuing duty to regulate the use of its rights-of-ways within the city's jurisdiction in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens living and working in the city. 
(15)  The city's powers, both governmental and proprietary, in regard to its rights-of-way have not been preempted by the Florida Legislature. 
(16)  In City of Oviedo v. Alafaya Utilities, Inc., 704 So. 2d 206 (Fla. 5 th DCA 1998), the Fifth District Court of Appeals has construed F.S. § 337.401(1) to allow cities to grant the use of their rights-of-way subject to such reasonable rules and regulations governing such use as any such city deems necessary or appropriate. 
(17)  The city is entitled to collect from franchisees a fee in return for a grant of property rights to franchisees, namely the use and occupation of the rights-of-way and public lands within the city for the construction, ownership, operation and maintenance of electric distribution lines and associated facilities. Alachua County v. State of Florida, 737 So. 2d 1065 (Fla. 1999); City of Plant City v. Mayo, 337 So. 2d 966 (Fla. 1976); Santa Rosa County v. Gulf Power Co., 635 So. 2d 96 (Fla. 1 st DCA 1994). 
(18)  In order to insure that any franchise fee negotiated with any franchisee which is granted the authority to use and occupy the city's rights-of-way hereunder is appropriate and reasonable, the city declares that it may consider the testimony and advice of experts as to what constitutes an appropriate, reasonable and market-rate franchise fee and will negotiate and determine franchise fees based on such testimony and advice and other relevant considerations. 
(19)  The city's police powers in regard to its rights-of-way and Public lands are not preempted by the Florida Public Service Commission, as stated in F.S. § 366.11(2). 
(20)  The city may charge rent for use of its rights-of-way and public lands so long as the amount of the rental has a reasonable nexus with the rental value of the rights-of-way and public lands, as stated in Alachua County v. State, 737 So. 2d 1065 (Fla. 1999), City of Pensacola v. Southern Bell Telephone Co., 37 So. 820 (Fla. 1905), and City of St. Louis v. Western Union, 148 U.S. 92 (1893). 
(21)  The aesthetics of the city are adversely affected by the franchisee's use and occupation of the city's rights-of-way and public lands; 
(22)  The city is limited in its use of its rights-of-way and public lands used and occupied by franchisee, in that it cannot allow another utility to occupy that space, so long as the franchisee remains in the rights-of-way and public lands; 
(23)  The occupation of the rights-of-way by the franchisee results in higher costs when the city makes improvements to the rights-of-way; 
(24)  It is hereby declared a matter protecting the public health, safety and welfare from unsafe and unauthorized use of public property interests, benefitting the public health, safety and welfare and in the best interests of the city and its inhabitants, property owners and merchants, that the city make affordable, safe and reliable electric service available within the city. 
(25)  It being within the city's authority to do so, the city hereby establishes the reasonable conditions set forth below which shall be the minimum conditions under which any existing franchise to provide electric distribution service shall be governed upon the expiration of any such franchise and until the terms of a new franchise are agreed and under which any future franchises to provide electric distribution service within the city shall be granted by the city. 
(26)  The city hereby adopts this article pursuant to the power and authority granted to the city by Article VIII, Section 2, Florida Constitution, and F.S. ch. 166. 
(Ord. No. 2420-01, § 2, 6-12-01) 
Sec. 102-208. - Nature of franchise granted. 
    The city may grant to any franchisee ("franchisee") which the city finds capable of meeting the requirements of this article a non-exclusive right to construct, operate and maintain an electric distribution system ("electric distribution system") within the rights-of-way in the city. Any such franchise shall be provided by the city by means of a specific franchise ordinance which shall be negotiated at arms length with the intended franchisee, and which shall at minimum, incorporate the terms and conditions contained herein and shall also contain additional terms and conditions consistent with the city's authority under Florida law which the city and franchisee may negotiate (the "electric distribution service franchise"). Applicants for an electric distribution service franchise shall submit to the city written application on forms to be provided by the city. All such franchise applications when filed shall be available for public inspection at places designated by the city. No later than 60 days after the application is submitted, the first of two or more public hearings shall be held on the application. A decision shall be made by the city not later than 21 days after the conclusion of the last of such public hearings based upon an evaluation of the application, the hearings, and other information that the city may deem relevant. The applicant shall assume the cost of publication of any ordinance to grant a franchise, as such publication is required by law, and such is payable prior to final consideration of the request by the city commission. No person, firm, or entity may conduct business in the city's right-of-way unless it complies with the terms of this article unless said person, firm, or corporation was in place and operating prior to the grant of any franchise to that person, firm or corporation by the city. Grant of a franchise under this article shall create a vested right in the franchisee for the term of the franchise, subject to state law and this article. 
(Ord. No. 2420-01, § 3, 6-12-01) 
Sec. 102-209. - Reservation of rights. 
    Nothing in this article or in any electric distribution service franchise shall be construed to prevent the city from constructing any public facility, grading, paving, repairing and/or altering any rights-of-way or easements. Whenever the city deems it necessary that franchisee's electric distribution system and any rights-of-way or easements must be relocated, franchisee shall relocate, support and protect that portion of the electric distribution system at franchisee's sole cost. In such event, the city shall order the relocation in writing and provide franchisee with adequate time to complete the relocation. The city agrees to cooperate with franchisee in an effort to minimize interruption electric service and any relocation cost. The city hereby expressly reserves the following additional rights to: 
(1)  Exercise its governmental powers, now or hereafter, to the full extent that such powers may be vested in or granted to the city. 
(2)  Adopt, in addition to the provisions contained herein, in the electric distribution service franchise and in any existing ordinances, such additional reasonable regulations as it shall find necessary and appropriate in the exercise of its police powers. Nothing herein shall be construed as a waiver of the franchisee's legal rights to timely contest the exercise or the validity of the exercise of the city's police powers. 
(3)  Renegotiate in good faith any electric distribution service franchise granted pursuant to this article should any material provision of this article or the electric distribution service franchise be declared unenforceable, illegal or invalid. 
(4)  Include the right at any time during the life of an electric distribution service franchise granted herein to acquire by condemnation for any public purpose all or part of, placed under this grant within the city's property, streets or rights-of-way, at a fair and just value, which shall not include any amount for the grant itself, or of any of the rights and privileges hereby granted, and this grant and franchise shall thereupon terminate as to the portion so acquired by the city. 
(5)  Reserve the right to grant, at any time, as many electric distribution service franchises as it deems appropriate; provided, however, that no such additional grant shall operate to materially modify, revoke or terminate any rights previously granted to any franchisee.

(Ord. No. 2420-01, § 5, 6-12-01) 
Sec. 102-211. - Access to rights-of-way. 
    A franchisee shall be responsible for the costs associated with the design, construction and operation of the electric distribution system and any modifications thereto. The city shall provide franchisee access to its rights-of-way within the city necessary to allow the timely construction, operation and maintenance of the electric distribution system as permitted in the applicable electric distribution service franchise. 
(Ord. No. 2420-01, § 6, 6-12-01) 
Sec. 102-212. - Conditions on use of rights-of-way. 
    The following shall constitute general conditions applicable to the placement of any electric distribution system within the city's rights-of-way: 
(1)  Prior to the installation, placement or removal of any conduits, facilities, cables or pole lines, or the start of any other type of construction on the public rights-of-way, franchisee shall, pursuant to the requirements of existing or subsequently enacted city ordinances, obtain all permits from, and pay all applicable fees to, the city. Such permits shall set out the place, date and time where the cables, pole lines, and other form of construction are to be installed, or removed or where the construction is to be conducted. All permit applications submitted by franchisee shall contain plans showing known utility facilities and specifications, and the proposed location of its conduits, cables, poles, lines and other associated facilities. No such permit shall create a vested property right in the franchisee. Further, issuance of a permit by the city shall not be construed by franchisee as a warranty that the placement by franchisee of its electric distribution system is in compliance with any applicable rules, regulations or laws. 
(2)  Any type of construction by franchisee shall be performed with the least possible interference with the use of the public rights-of-way and to adjoining property owners and in compliance with the rules and regulations of the state department of transportation and any other applicable governmental authority having jurisdiction. 
(3)  Any addition or improvement to the electric distribution system placed without first having obtained all applicable city permits shall be removed within 30 days' written notice by the city to remove the same and, in default of compliance with such notice, the conduits, cables or poles may be removed by order of the city and the cost of removal shall be borne and paid by franchisee, or in the event the city approves the placement of same after the fact, franchisee shall obtain all requisite permits therefor and pay all applicable penalties and fees. 
(4)  Franchisee shall not in any way displace, damage or destroy any electric distribution system, sewer, water main, pipe or any other facilities belonging to the city, or to any third party who placed such facilities therein by express authority of the city, without the consent of the city, and franchisee shall be liable to the city or to the third party owner, as the case may be, for the cost of any repairs made necessary by any such displacement, damage or destruction and shall pay such costs within 30 days of franchisee's receipt of an invoice for same.

(Ord. No. 2420-01, § 8, 6-12-01) 
Sec. 102-214. - Franchise fees/audit rights. 
(a)  Franchise fee payment. As a consideration for the grant of any electric service distribution franchise, franchisee shall pay to the city a franchise fee ("franchise fee") in the amount to be negotiated by franchisee and the city based upon a reasonable percentage of the annual gross revenue of franchisee from the sale of electric energy over the electric distribution system or any such other mutually agreeable methodology as the reasonable rental and use for such rights-of-way. The franchise fee provided for herein shall constitute the exclusive payment by franchisee to the city for franchisee's use and occupancy of the rights-of-way within the city's boundaries. For purposes of this article, a franchise fee of six percent shall be rebuttably presumed to be a reasonable franchise fee. The city may negotiate with franchisee a franchise fee which is more or less than six percent in return for other value provided to the city through negotiations with franchisee, or based on other relevant considerations. 
(b)  Time of payment. Within 30 calendar days after the close of each month, the franchisee shall pay the franchise fee as provided in subsection (a) of this section and file with the city's finance director a statement, signed and certified by an authorized accountant or financial representative of franchisee, of the revenues derived in the preceding quarter. Acceptance of any franchise fee payment shall not be deemed a waiver or release of any claims the city may have for additional sums, nor be construed as an accord that the amount paid is correct. 
(c)  Documentation and audit rights. Accompanying each franchise fee payment, franchisee shall prepare and provide all reasonable calculations and documentation necessary to support the franchise fee payment calculations. In the event the city disputes the amount of any franchise fee payment made, the city shall be entitled to perform or cause to be performed an independent audit of franchisee's accounts with respect to revenues earned by franchisee from the sale of electric energy over the electric distribution system. The city shall provide franchisee with 30 days prior written notice of its intent to perform any such audit. Upon receipt of such notice, franchisee shall make available the applicable documentation and records necessary to allow the city to perform the audit. 
(d)  Audit. The city may require an audit of franchisee's books not more frequently than once each calendar year. Franchisee will reimburse city's audit costs if the audit identifies errors in the franchisee's franchise revenues of five percent or more for the period audited that results in franchisee having underpaid the franchise fee. Errors identified during the audit process shall be projected retrospectively for any additional time periods not covered during the audit if there is a reasonable probability these errors occurred during the unaudited period, but not for more than five years. If an underpayment of the franchise fee has occurred, interest will be computed at a rate of ten percent per annum from the date such underpayment was originally due. Both the underpayment and interest shall be paid within 30 days after receipt of demand therefor from city. 
(e)  Other taxes. The sums of money to be paid by the franchisee to the city under this section are compensation and consideration for the use by the franchisee of the city's public ways for the construction, maintenance and operation of the electric distribution system and are not taxes as allowed by the Florida Constitution, the general or special laws of the state, or any other ordinances of the city. The franchisee shall at all times continue to be subject to public service taxes (F.S. § 166.231), ad valorem taxes (F.S. § 166.211) and such other taxes, charges or fees as may be lawfully authorized by the Florida Constitution, the general or special laws of the state, the provisions of the Municipal Home Rule Powers Act (F.S. ch. 166) or the ordinances of the city.

c.  At any time the electric distribution system is upgrading or rebuilding, all or any portion of the electric distribution system, the franchisee shall provide a performance bond in the amount of 110 percent of the estimated cost of public improvements in the right-of-way until all construction is completed. 
d.  The franchisee shall also maintain, at all times, during the time of the franchise, an annual performance bond in the amount of $200,000.00 to guarantee the payment of all sums which may become due to the city and also guarantee the repair, removal and/or relocation works required under this article or the franchise.

(2)  Notice. The performance bonds required herein shall be in a form satisfactory to the city and shall require 30 days' prior written notice to the city and the franchisee of any intention of non-renewal, alteration or cancellation.

Upon the occurrence of any of the above events of default by franchisee, the city shall provide written notice detailing the event of default. The franchisee shall within 30 days of the date of written notice from the city substantially undertake and promptly correct such default and certify same to the city. If franchisee fails to commence corrective action of the default within 30 days after written notice by the city, the city may terminate and revoke the electric distribution service franchise. Such termination and revocation shall be by ordinance duly adopted, and shall in no way affect any of the city's rights and remedies under the electric distribution service franchise, this article or any provision of law. In the event that such termination and revocation depends upon a finding of fact, such finding of fact as made by the city shall be conclusive; provided, however, that before an electric distribution service franchise may be terminated and revoked under this section, franchisee must be provided with an opportunity to be heard before the city commission.

(Ord. No. 2420-01, § 13, 6-12-01) 
Sec. 102-219. - Purchase option requirement. 
    No electric distribution service franchise shall be granted by the city hereunder unless such electric distribution service franchise reserves the right of the city and requires the franchisee, as a condition precedent to the effectiveness of the electric distribution service franchise, the right at and after the franchise Term to purchase franchisee's electric distribution system or any portion thereof as the city may desire. The purchase price shall be based upon the valuation of the electric distribution system (or portion thereof) established by binding arbitration as provided by law.

Sec. 102-222. - Terms governing "hold over" franchisees. 
    In the event that any franchisee has been granted a franchise by the city prior to the date of the ordinance (a "pre-existing franchise") or if an electric distribution service franchise granted under this article is terminated, revoked, or expires, then upon the termination, revocation, or expiration of said franchise, the following shall apply: 
(1)  Termination of franchise. The city may in at its sole discretion, either terminate the franchise rights of franchisee or enter into negotiations for a new franchise consistent with the requirements of this article. 
(2)  Interim rights of parties. If the city chooses to enter into negotiations with a franchisee under subsection (1) above, or if a pre-existing franchise holder refuses to renew or extend its pre-existing franchise, or if the pre-existing franchise expires under its own terms, or if a termination event under section 102-218 occurs, then franchisee shall be considered a tenant at sufferance on the city's property, streets and rights-of-way and shall be obligated to continue to perform its obligations under the terms of the terminated pre-existing franchise or electric distribution service franchise (as applicable) until any such negotiations have been completed and a new electric distribution service franchise has become effective or, if applicable, arbitration proceedings have been completed and the city has exercised its option to acquire title and completed the purchase of the electric distribution system.

Neither the existence of other remedies identified in this article nor the exercise thereof shall be deemed to bar or otherwise limit the right of the city to recover fines, penalties or monetary damages for such violation by franchisee or judicial enforcement of franchisee's obligations by means of specific performance, injunctive relief or mandate or any other administrative remedy or judicial remedy at law or in equity.

Sec. 114-6. - Lakeshore protection. 
(a)  Every person desiring to perform or cause to be performed any shoreline alteration involving the removal of aquatic shoreline or waterfront vegetation shall be required to obtain a permit in conformance with the procedures and standards set forth in this section, unless exempted. The commission, after recommendation from the lakes and waterways advisory board, shall be empowered to grant a permit only if the applicant demonstrates that this shoreline or waterfront clearing or alteration will not be adverse to the public purposes and benefits of maintaining lake water quality and fish and wildlife habitat and reducing nutrient loading by maintaining shoreline and waterfront vegetation necessary for the health and viability of a lake system. The applicant must further demonstrate that the proposed removal of vegetation will not degrade water quality below the standards set forth in Chapter 62, Florida Administrative Code, and any applicable requirements of state and federal law. The procedures and standards required for the permit shall be as follows: 
(1)  The requirement to obtain a permit for the removal of shoreline or waterfront vegetation shall not apply to: 
a.  Lawn mowing, trimming of landscaping and other lawn maintenance activities that are above the ordinary high water line (as defined in section 58-83, Winter Park Code of Ordinances), and which activity does not result in the removal or clearance of shoreline or waterfront vegetation. 
b.  Vegetation removal/management on lakes under 40 acres in total area. The public works director or his designee will provide recommended best management practices for shorelines on small lakes. 
(2)  Each applicant for a shoreline alteration permit shall submit photographs and materials addressing the following items: 
a.  The percentage, area, and types of shoreline and waterfront vegetation proposed to be removed and to be maintained. 
b.  If dredging or regrading is proposed a plan showing any proposed changes in shoreline contour must be provided which includes existing and proposed topographic elevations. Also included shall be the quantities of material to be removed and filled in cubic yards. 
c.  The proposed method for controlling erosion, filtering runoff and reducing nutrient concentration and stabilizing the soil (the use of a jet pump requires a turbidity barrier - see paragraph 114-6(8)). 
d.  The reasons for such request and an explanation of the hardship expected if a permit is not granted. 
(3)  Applications for vegetation removal will be approved for the following purposes only: 
a.  The creation of an access corridor for boating and swimming activities. Access corridors may be up to 50 feet wide, or up to 50 percent of the linear width of the shoreline, whichever is less, and may extend from the shoreline out to open water. Docks, boat ramps or other features, which preclude shoreline vegetation growth, are included in the total area allowed for an access corridor. 
b.  The removal of exotic vegetation to be replaced with native aquatic plants. 
c.  The removal of exotic vegetation from within existing native plant stands, provided that the native plant stands remain intact. 
(4)  Applications for vegetation removal will only be approved for properties that meet the following vegetation standards: 
a.  Existing or proposed access corridor must not exceed 50 feet wide, or 50 percent of the linear width of the shoreline, whichever is less. 
b.  All of the linear width of the shoreline outside of the access corridor must be vegetated. 
c.  At least 70 percent of the vegetated portion of the shoreline must contain emergent, aquatic vegetation. 
d.  No more than 30 percent of the vegetated portion of the shoreline may contain floating leaf species (such as fragrant water lily, or other floating leaf plants) only. 
e.  To be considered sufficient, stands of existing plants must be the functional equivalent of four rows of nursery stock plants planted on two-foot centers (30 plants or greater per 100 square feet) as determined by the public works director or his designee. 
f.  The presence of submersed vegetation (eel grass, pondweed, etc.) will not be counted for the purposes of shoreline vegetation determination. 
g.  Certain exotic, emergent plant species, that are high priority target species for eradication due to their potential for causing rapid ecological or economic damage, will not be counted for the purposes of shoreline vegetation determination. The city may treat or remove these plants on any city waterways as deemed necessary to effect control. High priority target species that will not be counted for vegetation determination and may be treated or removed by the city are: water hyacinth (Eichornia crassipes), snowflake lilies (Nymphoides cristata) and parrot feather milfoil (Myriophyllum aquaticum). 
(5)  Applications for vegetation removal on properties that do not meet the vegetation standards listed in subsection 114-6(a)(4) will be denied or will be conditionally approved pending the revegetation of the shoreline. The public works director, or his designee, will provide the applicant with detailed standards for revegetation when required including a list of approved species, the number of plants required, and maximum allowed spacing. The public works director or his designee may include other conditions on any permit issued as may be reasonable and necessary to further the purpose and intent of this chapter. 
(6)  All cleared or trimmed vegetation shall be removed from the lake and lakefront for off-site disposal. Any permit issued may be revoked by the city for violation or noncompliance with the provisions of the permit, this chapter, mistake of fact or conflict with other city, county, or state regulations. 
(7)  The changing of any shoreline by digging or adding fill, which alters or changes the shoreline or existing topography of the shoreline or waterfront of any water body within the city, shall be prohibited, unless done in accordance with an approved shoreline alteration permit. A permit shall also be required to pump or withdraw sand or any other material from lake bottoms. 
(8)  The use of a jet pump, or other hydraulic methods, for the removal of aquatic or shoreline vegetation is prohibited unless a properly installed turbidity barrier is in place prior to the commencement of work, and remains in place until the project is complete and turbidity within the work area returns to ambient levels. 
(9)  Nothing in this subsection is intended to relieve a property owner or contractor of any obligation under state law to obtain required permits from the state department of environmental protection, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission or other governmental authorities having jurisdiction, when applicable. 
(10)  The public works director, director of planning and community development and police chief are responsible for enforcing this section. They may delegate enforcement authority to one or more appropriate designees. 
(b)  The construction of retaining walls, seawalls or revetments on any lakefront, canal front, streamfront, etc., shall be prohibited except when done in accordance with law and after obtaining a permit from the city. 
(1)  Permits for the construction of retaining walls or seawalls shall be granted only with the prior approval of the lakes and waterways advisory board after a public hearing. This board shall render a decision on the application for its approval, approval with conditions or denial within 60 days after receipt of an application. 
(2)  The application for a permit shall include plans drawn to scale including a site plan of the property showing the proposed location of the alteration and the relation to adjacent properties and construction plans showing details of materials proposed and pictures detailing existing shoreline conditions in the area. An application fee established by the city shall be paid to cover the administrative costs of processing the application. Notices shall be mailed at least ten days prior to the first hearing date to the owners of lakefront or canal front properties adjacent to the subject property noticing the date, time, and location of all review hearings. 
(3)  Applications for seawalls or revetments should be considered favorably only when the structure is a dire necessity to stem erosion and loss of shoreline that is markedly different from that experienced in general. On lakefronts, vertical seawalls shall be disallowed in favor of sloped riprap revetments (minimum slope 3:1, horizontal to vertical) that allow wave energy dissipation and allow shoreline vegetation to propagate. Vertical sheet pile, with a nonvertical riprap face, may be allowed on a case-by-case basis to minimize turbidity, or vegetation disturbance during construction provided that the entire face of the vertical component is covered by the sloped riprap component, the finished face meets the 3:1 minimum slope requirement, and the elevation of the vertical component does not exceed the natural ground elevation. Vertical seawalls may be allowed on a case-by-case basis in canals or other altered water bodies where sloped revetments could interfere with navigation, or where conditions make the construction of sloped revetments impractical. Construction for cosmetic reasons is not sufficient justification. The review by the city advisory boards and city commission shall include the environmental ramifications of the request, its relationship to the ecology of the lake or stream as a whole and the specific shoreline characteristics of the property involved. Approvals of any shoreline modification shall be the minimum necessary to allow relief. As a condition of the seawall/revetment permit, shorelines that do not meet the vegetation standards of this section (subsection 114-6(a)) shall be required to be planted so that no more than 50 feet, or 50 percent (whichever is less) of the shoreline remains clear of vegetation. 
(4)  Applications for a repair to a seawall shall be considered favorably only when the repair to the structure is a dire necessity and when the repair can be completed from the back side of the structure. With a city permit, repair to the front side and/or top of the seawall structure shall be limited to 25 percent of the entire length or 30 feet, whichever is less. Also, with a city permit, painting and covering the face of the seawall shall be allowed for cosmetic purposes, keeping in mind the 25-percent or 30-foot limit on repairs. As a condition of the repair permit, shorelines that do not meet the vegetation standards of this section (subsection 114-6(a)) shall be required to be planted so that no more than 50 feet, or 50 percent (whichever is less) of the shoreline remains clear of vegetation. 
(5)  Nothing in this subsection is intended to relieve a property owner or contractor of any obligation under state law to obtain required permits from the city building department, state department of environmental protection or other governmental authorities having jurisdiction, when applicable. 
(c)  The construction of new boat ramps shall be prohibited: (i) on lakes where access is available from public ramps; and (ii) on lakes where motorboats are prohibited by section 114-65. 
(1)  Shoreline alteration permits for the construction of boat ramps on lakes within the city that have no public access, or where motorboats are not prohibited, shall be granted only with the prior approval of the lakes and waterways advisory board after a public hearing. This board shall render a decision on the application for its approval, approval with conditions or denial within 60 days after receipt of an application. 
(2)  The application for boat ramps shall include plans drawn to scale including a site plan showing the location of the proposed ramp and the relation to other properties, and construction plans showing details of materials proposed, and pictures detailing existing shoreline conditions in the area. An application fee, established by the city, shall be paid to cover the administrative costs of processing the application. Notices shall be mailed at least ten days prior to the first hearing date to owners of lakefront or canal front properties adjacent to the subject property noticing the date, time, and location of the review hearings.

Sec. 114-56. - Reciprocity with City of Maitland. 
    At such time as the City of Maitland shall adopt and have in effect an ordinance with sufficient similarity to this chapter relating to boats and containing a like reciprocity section, all motorboats for which the user fee has been duly and properly paid to the City of Maitland shall be permitted to be operated upon any waterway within the corporate limits of the City of Winter Park without the payment of any further user fee to the City of Winter Park or requirement for securing any user fee from the City of Winter Park. 
(Code 1960, § 7-22) 
Sec. 114-57. - Applicability of federal and state laws. 
    All boats operating on or about the waterways of the city shall be subject to federal and state laws and regulations relating thereto, the provisions of this chapter being supplementary to such laws and regulations. 
(Code 1960, § 7-2) 
Sec. 114-58. - User fees. 
(a)  Required. Every owner of a motorboat having an inboard or outboard motor operating upon any waterway, either partially or wholly within the corporate limits of the city, shall be required to pay the city a user fee to offset the cost of patrolling and maintaining such waterways. 
(b)  Prerequisites. In order to use a boat on city waterways, the owner shall give the make, model, horsepower, length of boat and state registration number and certify that such boat has all equipment required by the state and the city. Owners of boats carrying more than four persons for hire shall also present satisfactory evidence that the boat has been safety inspected and found to be safe either by the Coast Guard or the police department. 
(c)  Collection agents. The city commission may, from time to time, designate an agent to collect user fees and dispense receipts and may provide for a service fee to be paid by the city to the collection agent for user fees collected. 
(d)  Transfer of receipt. Sale or transfer of ownership of a motorboat to which is attached a receipt showing payment of the user fee shall not invalidate the receipt, provided the police department or finance department is notified within ten days of such change in ownership. The intent of the city commission is that a user fee be paid and receipts issued for each motorboat utilizing city waterways, regardless of ownership or transfer of ownership. Receipts, however, are not transferable from one boat to another. 
(e)  Display of receipt. The owner shall at all times display an appropriate valid user fee receipt on the boat, or the operator shall have in his possession a valid daily user fee receipt.

State Law reference- User fees authorized, F.S. § 166.201. 
Sec. 114-59. - User fee schedule; receipts; application of revenues. 
(a)  Receipts. Upon payment of the annual user fee required by this article, two receipts shall be issued to the payer of the user fee. Those receipts shall be affixed, one on each side of the bow, fore or aft of the state registration numbers. User fee decals issued shall be triangular in shape, with a square used for the following year and a circle for the next following year. These shapes shall be repeated in the same sequence during each succeeding three-year period. Upon payment of the daily user fee required by this article, a receipt in the form established by the city manager or his designee shall be issued to the payer of the 
user fee. 
_____
(b)  User fee schedule. A daily user fee of $6.00 shall be paid prior to the operation of any motorboat. In lieu of the daily user fee, an annual user fee may be paid based upon the dollar amount and unit as set forth in this subsection. The unit shall be calculated by adding the length of the boat in feet, rounded to the next higher whole foot, together with the manufacturer's advertised maximum horsepower of the engine, at maximum RPM, rounded to the next higher whole horsepower. The total of these two numbers is the number of units assigned to each motorboat and will be the basis for calculating boat user fees. Length shall mean the measurement from end to end over the deck parallel to the centerline, excluding sheer. The user fee shall be imposed by applying the unit for each boat times the user's fee factor set forth as follows: 
Noncommercial 
Annual Commercial 
Annual Motorboat owned by city resident $0.50 $1.00 Motorboat owned by non-city resident  0.75  1.50  
Annual user fees paid between January 1 and June 30 shall be one-half of this amount.

Section 1. - Findings. 
    After duly noticed public hearings, the city commission has considered: 
(a)  The economic impact upon private property within the city; 
(b)  The public need for a cable communications franchise; 
(c)  The capacity of public rights-of-way to accommodate the cable communications system; 
(d)  The present and future use of the public rights-of-way to be used by the cable communications system; 
(e)  The potential disruption to existing users of the public rights-of-way to be used by the cable communications systems and the resultant inconvenience which may occur to the public; 
(f)  The financial ability of the franchise applicant to perform; 
(g)  Other societal interests as are generally considered in cable television franchising; 
(h)  Such other additional matters, both procedural and substantive, as the city has determined to be relevant.

Editor's note- Printed herein is Ord. No. 2456-02, as adopted by the city commission on March 29, 2002. Amendments to the ordinance are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original ordinance. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors have been corrected without notation. For stylistic purposes, a uniform system of headings, catchlines, capitalization, citation to state statutes, and expression of numbers in text has been used to conform to the Code of Ordinances. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. 

Sec. 1. - Short title. 
    This ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the "Orlando Utilities Commission Electric Distribution System Franchise." 
Sec. 2. - Findings. 
    The city commission of the City of Winter Park, Florida (the "city") hereby makes the following findings and declares its legislative interest as follows: 
(1)  The city annexed certain property into the city's incorporated boundaries. 
(2)  The Orlando Utilities Commission (hereafter "OUC") currently provides electric distribution service to the area that has been annexed into the city's incorporated boundaries. 
(3)  On June 12, 2001, the city adopted its electric franchise distribution ordinance, Ordinance No. 2420-01. 
(4)  The electric franchise distribution ordinance authorizes the city to grant any franchisee which the city finds capable of meeting the ordinance's requirements a non-exclusive electric distribution franchise. 
(5)  OUC has applied for and requested such a franchise, and tendered competent, substantial evidence that OUC is capable of meeting the said ordinance's requirements. 
(6)  The parties agree that OUC requires such a franchise and that the city has authority to grant such a franchise. 
(7)  OUC has certified and demonstrated a net worth of not less than $100,000,000.00; therefore, the bonding requirements of section 10 of the electric franchise distribution ordinance are not necessary to protect the interest of the city and may be waived by the city. 
Sec. 3. - Grant of authority. 
    There is hereby granted by the city to OUC, the non-exclusive right and privilege to construct, erect, operate, own, maintain, repair, rehabilitate, and replace in, upon, along, across, above, over and under city rights-of-way now laid out or dedicated, and all extensions thereof, and additions thereto in the area described in Exhibit "A" attached to and incorporated in this ordinance and hereafter referred to as the "OUC Electric Distribution Franchise Area" poles, transformers, switchgear, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes, fiber optic cable for its own use and other fixtures necessary or proper for the maintenance and operation of its electric utility system, provided that all portions of the same shall conform to the National Electrical Safety Code. This non-exclusive franchise is awarded subject to the provisions of general or special laws of Florida now existing or hereinafter enacted. This grant of authority is limited to the provision by OUC of electric distribution utility services. OUC agrees that without the prior written permission of the city, it will not allow any new entity providing a wireless communication system to acquire rights to occupy rights-of-way under this franchise. In the event OUC desires to use its existing facilities, or construct new facilities, in order to provide public communications, leased fiber optic capacity, or video services to existing or potential consumers, OUC must obtain additional and separate permission from the city for such activities. The right to use and occupy rights-of-way for the purposes herein set forth shall be non-exclusive, and the city reserves the right to grant a similar use of said rights-of-way, to any person at any time during the period of this franchise. Nothing contained in this ordinance is intended in any way to affect any pre-existing territorial agreement which may exist between OUC and any other electric utility. The terms and provisions of the electric distribution franchise ordinance are incorporated in this Ordinance by reference. 
Sec. 4. - Term of franchise. 
    The franchise and rights herein granted shall take effect and be in force from and after the final passage hereof, as required by law and upon the filing of an acceptance by OUC of all the terms thereof with the city and shall continue in force and effect for a term of 30 years after the effective date of this franchise ordinance. 
Sec. 5. - Payment to city. 
(1)  Effective the first day of the second month beginning after the effective date of this ordinance, the city shall be entitled to receive from OUC a monthly franchise amount which will equal six percent of OUC's revenues from the sale of electricity to all customers, including but not limited to residential, commercial, and industrial customers (hereafter "base revenues") within the OUC Electric Distribution Franchise Area for the preceding month which amount shall be the total compensation due the city for the rights, authority and privileges granted by this franchise. 
(2)  Payment shall be made to the city for each month no later than the thirtieth day of the following month. The monthly payment may be made by wire transfer. Any monthly payment or any portion thereof received 30 days after the due date shall be subject to interest at the rate of ten percent per annum until all payments are paid in full. 
(3)  Without limiting anything contained in this ordinance, all other provisions set forth in subsections (2)-(5) of section 9 of the electric distribution franchise ordinance shall be complied with by OUC. 
Sec. 6. - Rates and services provided. 
    The rates to be charged and services provided by OUC for electric service within the corporate limits of the city during the term of this franchise shall be as provided by law. 
Sec. 7. - Character of service. 
    OUC agrees that the materials to be used in the construction, operation and maintenance of the electric distribution system and the service to be rendered thereby shall be in every respect equal to those provided to OUC's other customers. 
Sec. 8. - Indemnification, insurance and bond. 
    To the extent permitted by law, OUC shall indemnify the city, its employees, board members, agents, officers and assigns, their respective employees, agents, officers, partners and directors and anyone else acting for or on behalf of them as provided in and in accordance with section 12 of the electric distribution franchise ordinance. OUC, likewise, where applicable, will comply with the bonding and insurance requirements of sections 10 and 11 of the electric distribution franchise ordinance. 
Sec. 9. - Approval of transfer. 
(1)  The rights and privileges granted by this franchise shall not be sold, or assigned in whole or in part without the city's prior written approval; however, such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. No such sale or assignment shall be effective until the vendee or assignee has filed with the city an instrument, duly executed, reciting the fact of such sale, or assignment and agreeing to perform all the conditions thereof. 
(2)  OUC shall annually submit to the city, Attention: City Clerk, a copy of its audited annual financial report upon its normal issuance of same. 
Sec. 10. - City rights in franchise. 
    The right is hereby reserved to the city to adopt, in addition to the provisions herein contained and existing applicable ordinances, such additional regulations as it shall find necessary in the exercise of its police power, provided that such regulations, by ordinance or otherwise, shall be reasonable, and shall not be in conflict with the laws of the State of Florida, as specifically contemplated in section 4 of the electric distribution franchise ordinance. 
Sec. 11. - Work in the right-of-way. 
    Consistent with sections 6 and 7 of the electric distribution franchise ordinance, OUC is hereby granted the right, authority and privilege to make all necessary excavations in said rights-of-way, streets, avenues, alleys, thoroughfares, highways, bridges, and easements (collectively "rights-of-way") within the OUC Electric Distribution Franchise Area. OUC shall have the right to fasten and to stretch and lay along the lines of said poles, conduits, pipes and cables necessary for transmitting and conveying the electric current to be used in OUC's business. It is understood that there are within the OUC Electric Distribution Franchise Area various rights-of-way which the city does not have the unqualified right to authorize the OUC to use, because of reservations in favor of the dedicators or because of other legal impediments, therefore, in making any grant under this franchise, the city does not warrant or represent as to any particular right-of-way that it has the right to authorize the OUC to install or maintain portions of its electric utility system therein. 
Sec. 12. - City's authority. 
    Nothing in this franchise shall prevent the city from levying and collecting such taxes as the city may from time to time be empowered, by law, to levy and collect provided such taxes shall be applied uniformly to all persons within the city's corporate limits and shall not constitute an additional tax or fee for OUC's use of the rights-of-way. Such taxes are not considered part of the franchise fees. In the event the city acquires all of the facilities of OUC located in the rights-of-way of the city, then the rights granted under this franchise shall terminate and be of no further force or effect. 
Sec. 13. - City's option to purchase. 
    At and after the date of expiration of this franchise, OUC hereby grants to the city an option to purchase all its electrical plant and distribution facilities located within the OUC Electric Distribution Franchise Area which are used in connection with this franchise or right, at a valuation of the property desired, real and personal, which valuation shall be fixed by arbitration as provided by law. Excepted from this reservation are power plants and high tension transmission lines owned by OUC and connected with its general system of distribution and used for purposes of serving communities other than the city herein. As a condition precedent to the taking effect of this franchise grant, OUC shall give and grant to the city the right to purchase herein so reserved. OUC shall be deemed to have given and granted such right of purchase and satisfied this condition precedent by its acceptance of this franchise. 
Sec. 14. - Severability. 
    Should any section or provision of this franchise ordinance or any portion thereof, the deletion of which would not adversely affect (in the general sense) the receipt of any material benefits or, substantially increase the burden of any party hereunder, be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remainder, as a whole or any part thereof, other than the part declared to be invalid. In the event of any such partial invalidity, the city and OUC shall meet and negotiate in good faith to obtain a replacement provision that is in compliance with the judicial authority's decisions. 
Sec. 15. - Acceptance. 
    This ordinance shall become effective upon being legally passed and adopted by the City of Winter Park City Commission of the City of Winter Park, as provided by law, and it is further agreed that OUC shall accept this franchise as of the date of the passage and adoption by the City of Winter Park City Commission and shall signify its acceptance in writing within fifteen (15) days after the City of Winter Park City Commission's approval of this ordinance by filing in written acceptance with the City of Winter Park Clerk. 
Sec. 16. - Governing law and venue. 
(1)  The rights and privileges granted to OUC by this franchise shall at all times be subordinate and inferior to the rights of the public in and to the ordinary use of the city's rights-of-way and nothing in this franchise shall be considered as a surrender by the city of its right and power to use and relocate the use of its rights-of-way. 
(2)  In the event that any legal proceeding is brought to enforce the terms of this franchise, the same shall be brought in Orange County, Florida, or, if a federal claim, in the U.S. District Court in and for the Middle District of Florida, Orlando Division. 
Sec. 17. - Notices. 
    Except in exigent circumstances, all notices by either City or OUC to the other shall be made by either depositing such notice in the United States Mail, certified mail return receipt requested or by facsimile. Any notice served by certified mail return receipt shall be deemed delivered five days after the date of such deposit in the United States Mail unless otherwise provided.

Sec. 18. - Non-waiver provision. 
    The failure of either party to insist in any one or more instances upon the strict performance of any one or more of the terms or provisions of this franchise shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment for the future of any such term or provision, and the same shall continue in full force and effect.

Such means may include, but not be limited to, City taking over and operating the collection equipment used in the performance of this Agreement until such time Contractor can perform the collection and disposal services and City contracting with a third party to perform the collection and disposal services. Any cost incurred by City in exercising this option shall be charged against Contractor and the performance bond or alternative letter of credit furnished by Contractor under this Agreement. The foregoing option shall only be exercised by a majority vote of the City's City Commission after the City Commission has declared that the disruption has caused an emergency to arise within the service area that adversely affects the public health, safety, and welfare.

In the event that the city determines not to impose any franchise compensation by agreement, ordinance or otherwise on any such alternate gas provider, the company's obligation to pay a franchise fee under this agreement with respect to revenues derived from the provision of services by the company to the comparable class of customers served by such alternate gas provider thereafter shall be extinguished. 
Section 6. - Rights reserved. 
    The city hereby expressly reserves the following rights to: 
(1)  Exercise its governmental powers to the full extent that such powers may be vested in or granted to the city. 
(2)  Adopt, in addition to the provisions contained in this ordinance and in the franchise and in any applicable ordinances, such additional reasonable regulations as it shall find necessary in the exercise of its police power. 
(3)  Renegotiate the franchise granted pursuant to this ordinance should substantial sections of the ordinance be rendered void or unenforceable by FPSC or by subsequent changes in applicable federal or state laws. The company shall also have the right to renegotiate the franchise in the circumstances set forth in this subsection (3). 
Section 7. - Compliance. 
    The company shall not be relieved of any obligation to comply with any of the provisions of this ordinance or the franchise granted hereunder or any rule, regulation, requirement or directive promulgated thereunder because of any failure of the city or its officers, agents or employees to enforce prompt compliance. 
Section 8. - Alternative remedies. 
    No provision of this ordinance or the franchise granted hereunder shall be deemed to bar the right of the city to seek or obtain judicial relief from a violation of any provision of this ordinance, the franchise or any rule, regulation, requirement or directive promulgated under the franchise, whether administratively, judicially or both. Neither the existence of other remedies identified in this ordinance nor the exercise thereof shall be deemed to bar or otherwise limit the right of the city to recover fines, penalties or monetary damages (except where liquidated damages are otherwise prescribed) for such violation by the company or judicial enforcement of the company's obligations by means of specific performance, injunction relief or mandate or any other administrative remedy or judicial remedy at law or in equity. 
Section 9. - Limit on company's recourse. 
(a)  Except as expressly provided in this ordinance and the franchise agreement, the company shall have no recourse against the city for any loss, expense or damage resulting from the terms and conditions of this ordinance or the franchise because of the city's enforcement thereof. The company expressly agrees that upon its acceptance of the franchise it does so relying upon its own investigation and understanding of the power and authority of the city to grant the franchise. 
(b)  The company, by accepting the franchise, acknowledges that it has not been induced to accept same by any promise, verbal or written, by or on behalf of the city or by any third person regarding the franchise not expressed therein. The company further pledges that no promise or inducement, oral or written, has been made to any city employee or official regarding receipt of the franchise. 
(c)  The company further acknowledges by acceptance of the franchise that the company has carefully read the terms and conditions of this ordinance and the franchise agreement and accepts without reservation the obligations imposed by the terms and conditions herein and in the franchise agreement. 
(d)  The company shall provide timely written notice to the city for any waivers, exceptions or declaratory rulings, filed with the FPSC or any other state or federal regulatory agency, directly affecting the franchise agreement with the city. 
Section 10. - Assignments. 
(a)  This franchise shall not be sold, assigned or transferred, either in whole or in part, or leased or sublet, nor shall title thereto, either legal or equitable or any right, interest or property therein, pass to or vest in any person (other than a parent corporation of company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of company or a corporation under common control with company) without the prior written consent of the city, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or conditioned, nor unduly delayed. No such consent shall be required for a mortgage, or other hypothecation as a whole or in part to secure an indebtedness. 
(b)  Any successor-in-interest to the system and/or the rights under this franchise shall have agreed in writing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this franchise agreement, with a copy thereof provided to the city.

Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent the parties indemnified and held harmless herein from participating in the defense of any litigation by their own counsel at the city's sole expense. Such participation shall not under any circumstances relieve the company from its duty of defense against liability or of paying any judgment entered against such party. 
Section 12. - Company insurance. 
(a)  As a part of the indemnification provided by section 11, but without limiting the foregoing, each franchise company shall file with the application, and at all times thereafter maintain in full force and effect at its sole expense, an acceptable policy or policies, or evidence of self-insurance of liability insurance, including comprehensive general liability insurance, products/completed operations liability, personal injury liability, owners and contractors protective liability, broad form property damage, contractual liability, automobile liability (owned, nonowned and hired automobiles), workers' compensation and employer liability.

Section 13. - Termination. 
    In the event the company violates any of the material provisions of this ordinance, unless such violation results from a cause beyond the company's control, the company shall cease to operate the system within the city for any consecutive period of 180 days during the term of this franchise, except for causes beyond the company's control, or the company is precluded by governmental authority from charging the franchise fee provided in this ordinance to its customers and it provides the city with written notice of its desire to terminate this franchise, the city, at its option, may forthwith declare a forfeiture and termination of, and revoke and cancel all rights granted under this franchise, provided that prior to such termination by the city resulting from a violation by the company of any of the provisions of this ordinance, the company shall be served notice by the city with respect thereto. The company shall have 60 days after service of such notice within which to cure the violation, or within which to present a plan, satisfactory to the city, to accomplish the same. In the event of such termination, the company shall, within a reasonable time following demand by the city, take such steps as are necessary to render every portion of the system remaining within the public ways of the city safe. In the event the franchise is terminated due to the company ceasing operation as set forth above, or in the event the company provides notice to the city of its intent to abandon in its entirety the system within the city, then the company agrees that it shall, at the option of the city, convey and transfer those assets to the city so that such assets shall become the sole property of the city, at no cost to the city. 
Section 14. - Administrative performance evaluation session. 
(a)  Evaluation sessions may be held at any time during the term of the franchise at the request of the city manager, the city commission or the company.

(d)  During a review and evaluation by the city, the company shall fully cooperate with the city manager and shall provide such reasonable information and documents as the city manager may need to reasonably perform his review. To the extent permitted by law, a "non-disclosure" agreement, if requested by the company, shall be executed by the city manager prior to reviewing the company's confidential or proprietary information. Any pertinent, confidential or proprietary information shall be available for inspection by the city manager at the offices of the company. 
(e)  If at any time during his review the city manager determines that reasonable evidence exists of inadequate natural gas system performance, then the city manager will provide the existing reasonable evidence of inadequate performance to the company prior to the company being required to perform tests and analyses directed toward the suspected inadequacies.

    The city may require the test to be supervised at the company's expense by a professional engineer not on the permanent staff of the company; the professional engineer to be approved by the city manager, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any disapproval must be for good cause shown. Upon request, the company shall provide the qualifications of the professional engineer that the company selects to the city manager for review, in addition to providing the results of the analyses. The engineer shall sign all records of special tests and forward to the city such records with a report interpreting the results of the test and recommending actions to be taken. The city's rights under this subsection shall be limited to requiring tests, analyses and reports covering specific subjects and characteristics based on the complaints or other evidence when and under such circumstances the city has reasonable grounds to believe the complaints or other evidence require that tests be performed to protect the public against substandard natural gas service. 
Section 15. - Compliance with state and federal law.

To the extent possible, company shall make use of existing facilities and equipment available to the company. The company shall use its best efforts to individually notify all adjacent property owners affected by the proposed construction prior to the commencement of that work. Such notification shall not be required for emergencies necessitating immediate repairs. 
(e)  Notwithstanding the grant to use public ways, no public way shall be used by a company if the city, in its sole discretion, determines that such use is inconsistent with the terms, conditions or provisions by which the public way was created or dedicated or is being used. 
Section 17. - Conditions on public way occupancy. 
(a)  All facilities or equipment and other components of the distribution system installed by or maintained by the company within the city shall be so located to cause minimum interference with the proper use of streets, alleys and other public ways and places and to cause minimum interference with the rights and appearance and reasonable convenience of property owners who own property adjoining any such streets, alleys or other public ways and places.

(c)  The company shall, at its own cost and expense, replace and repair without delay any sidewalk, public way, alley, highway, waterway, bridge or any other public place that has been excavated, broken, removed, displaced or disarranged by the company in the conduct of its construction, maintenance and operation of any portion of the system, or as a result of the deterioration of any portion of the system, and restore the same to as good a condition as it existed prior to the company commencing its work. Upon failure of the company to do so after 30 days written notice by the director of public works of the city, the city may make such repairs and replacements as it deems reasonably necessary, and the company shall pay the city upon demand all costs of such repairs and replacements. The company shall, to the satisfaction of the public works director, maintain any repairs it makes pursuant to this section for a period of one year following the date of such repair. 
(d)  The company shall use all proper and reasonable care in connection with any work which it may do in, over, under or across any public way, alley, highway, waterway, bridge, easement or other public place of the city in seeking to prevent harm, damage or injury to persons or property therefrom.

(f)  The company shall not and shall prohibit any officer, agent, employee, contractor or subcontractor which the company retains from removing or substantially trimming any tree or major portion thereof, either above, at or below ground level, which is located within a public way without the prior written approval of the director of public works. Such consent may be given or withheld upon such terms and conditions as the director of public works deems appropriate. Each company shall be responsible for and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the city and its officers, agents and employees from and against any and all damages arising from or resulting from the removal, trimming, mutilation of or any injury to any tree proximately caused by the company or its officers, agents, employees, contractors or subcontractors. 
(g)  In the event the city requires the company to adapt or conform any portion of the system, or in any way to alter, temporarily or permanently relocate or to change any portion of same to enable any other person to use a public way, avenue, alley, sidewalk, highway, bridge, easement or other public place of the city, the company shall be reimbursed by the person desiring or occasioning such change for any loss, cost or expense caused by or arising out of such change, alteration or relocation of any portion of the system. 
(h)  In an emergency, as determined by the city, when the company or its representative is immediately unavailable or unable to provide the necessary immediate repairs to any portion of the system that is damaged or malfunctioning or to any faults or settled or sunken areas that may develop in any area over, around or adjacent to same, the city, when apprised of such an emergency, shall have the right to make the repairs with the total cost of same being charged to the company. 
(i)  In an effort to minimize the number of facilities within the city's public ways, the disruption of traffic and roadway destruction, the company shall enter into joint use agreements with the city and other parties who are expressly authorized by the city to use its public ways provided such agreements are satisfactory to the company. Nothing herein contained shall mandate that the company enter into joint use agreements. 
(j)  The company shall maintain and operate all parts of the system in good, safe and operable condition and shall render efficient service in accordance with the rules and regulations as are, or may be, set forth by the FPSC or by other agencies of the state lawfully empowered to regulate the activities of the company. 
(k)  Whenever, in case of fire or other disaster, it becomes necessary, in the reasonable judgment of the city, to remove or damage any of the company's facilities, no charge shall be made by the company against the city for restoration and repair reasonably necessary under the circumstances. The city shall endeavor to avoid or limit damage to the extent necessary under the circumstances. 
Section 18. - Relocation. 
    Except in an emergency, the company shall, within 180 days after receipt of written notice from the city, adjust, alter or relocate at its own cost and expense any portion of the system in the event the city, at the direction of the director of public works, determines that such adjustment, alteration or relocation is necessary for the city's use of its property and rights-of-way or if same unreasonably interferes with the convenient, safe or continuous use or the maintenance, improvement, extension or expansion of any public street, alley, highway, waterway, bridge, easement or other public place in the city. In the event such adjustment, alteration or relocation is incidental to work to be done by the city on a city road, such notice shall be given 60 days prior to the commencement of such work by the city. In the event such a contingency occurs and the company fails to cause the aforementioned adjustment, alteration or relocation as required herein, the city may remove such portion of the system and the total cost and expense therefor shall be charged to the company. The city shall provide the company with a notice and order as provided for in F.S. § 337.404 or any subsequently enacted law of the State of Florida in the event it may charge the company for the cost and expense of removing such portion of the system pursuant to this ordinance.

At company's option, representatives of company may accompany city personnel during any such inspection. 
(b)  If the company should violate any of the terms of this ordinance or any federal, state or local law or regulation, or any of the rules and regulations as may hereafter be from time to time lawfully adopted, or any provision of the franchise agreement, the city shall promptly give the company written notice of the violation, breach, default or noncompliance. The company shall within 30 days of the date of written notice from the city substantially undertake and promptly correct such default, breach, violation or noncompliance and certify the same to the city. In the event that the company fails to substantially undertake such corrective action within 30 days of the date of such written notice and promptly complete the corrective action, the city may, notwithstanding any other remedies provided for in this ordinance, or otherwise available under law: 
(1)  Make such correction itself and charge the cost of the same to the company; and/or 
(2)  Secure the proceeds from any financial performance instrument posted by the company or impose the sum of $50.00 per day for each day following the cure date that company fails to complete the corrective action; and/or 
(3)  For a material breach of this ordinance or the franchise agreement, declare the company in default and terminate the franchise and rights granted under the franchise.

In the event that the city determines not to impose any franchise compensation by agreement, ordinance or otherwise on any such alternate gas provider, the company's obligation to pay a franchise fee under this franchise agreement with respect to revenues derived from the provision of service by the company to the comparable class of customers served by such alternate gas provider thereafter shall be extinguished. 
Section 12. - Accounts and records.

Section 14. - Indemnification. 
(a)  The company shall, at the company's sole cost and expense, fully indemnify, defend and hold harmless the city, and in their capacity as such, the officers, agents, boards, commissioners, consultants and employees thereof, from and against any and all claims, suits, actions, proceedings, liability and judgments for damages:
