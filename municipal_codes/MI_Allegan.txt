PREFACE 
    This Code is a codification of the ordinances of Allegan, Michigan of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the Council through December 8, 1986. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 3 is numbered 3-1 and the fourth section of Chapter 1 is 1-4. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 1-3 and 1-4 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 1-3.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under direct supervision of Bill Carroll, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Mr. Hannes Meyers, Jr., City Attorney, and Mr. Michael Schepers, City Manager, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

The Code entitled "Code of Ordinances, City of Allegan, Michigan" published by Municipal Code Corporation consisting of Chapters 1 to 30, each inclusive, is hereby adopted and enacted, which Code shall supersede all general and permanent ordinances of the City passed on or before December 8, 1986, to the extent provided in section 2 hereof.

    In addition to other provisions of this charter, a vacancy shall be deemed to exist in any elective office on the day when the officer dies, files a resignation with the city clerk, is removed from office, moves from the city, is convicted of a felony, or of misconduct in office under this charter, is judicially declared to be mentally incompetent, or is absent from three (3) consecutive regular meetings of the council, unless excused by the council for cause to be stated in the record of council proceedings.

Former ch. 5 pertained to similar subject matter as derived from Ord. No. 155, §§ 1-8, 10, adopted May 14, 1979; Ord. No. 159, § 1, adopted June 27, 1979; and Ord.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 5-1 - Purpose and intent. 
    In considering this chapter 5, the city council is cognizant of the costs incurred by the city to accommodate major entertainment events so as to minimize jeopardy of the public health, safety and welfare. Enormous increases in traffic, noise, dust, demands on medical services, etc., occur with any sizeable crowd and, given the size of the city, a crowd of five thousand (5,000) or more is sizeable. Such events strain the city's public works, police, emergency medical service, fire and administrative staffs, often necessitating significant expenditures for overtime work or auxiliary staffing, and such strains increase with the size of any event, the overall number of events, the frequency of events and the particular time and date of events, particularly as they may overlap conditions like road construction, weather conditions, road or communication breakdowns or other conditions which impair traffic movement, communication, etc. In addressing these matters, the city council seeks to exercise its stewardship of the city's monetary, natural, personnel and other resources. 
    The city acknowledges, however, the direct value of some events, particularly community-wide events sponsored by civic, charitable, fraternal or other nonprofit organizations in the city, especially to the extent such events may also help raise funds used to support community programs or otherwise directly benefit the public welfare of city residents. The city council also acknowledges the theoretical, potential benefits to the city business from increased numbers of people and increased activity in the city.

Upon initial inspection, if the building official finds that the dwelling in question meets all requirements of this article and all other applicable ordinances of the city and there are no outstanding violation notices concerning the dwelling, the building official shall direct that the registration or registration renewal issued for such dwelling be for a period of three (3) years. If the building inspector upon initial inspection finds that the interior or exterior of the unit in question does not meet all the requirements of this article and all other applicable ordinances of the city, the owner, agent, or landlord, of the rental dwelling shall be notified in writing of the nature of the violations and the date by which the violations must be corrected. Upon finding that each unit and the interior and exterior of the dwelling meets all the requirements of this article and all other applicable ordinances of the city, the building official shall issue an registration for each dwelling. 
(m)	All rental dwellings must have an initial interior and exterior inspection scheduled within thirty (30) days prior to the date on which the registration expires. If ownership of the dwelling is transferred during the time that the registration is valid, the registration shall transfer to the new owner upon receipt by the building official of the name, address and telephone number of the new owner. A registration that has been transferred shall expire or be renewed at the same time as if it had not been transferred.

(1)	Upon receipt of a complaint from an owner or an occupant of the rental unit that it is in violation of this Code; 
(2)	Upon receipt of a complaint from any law enforcement department or other public agency or any other individual having personal knowledge that the rental unit is in violation of this Code;

(5)	Upon being directed by resolution of the city council to initiate a city-wide rental unit inspection program; and 
(6)	Upon receipt of a request from an owner of a rental unit for an advisory inspection.
(p)	Whenever a complaint is filed with the building official alleging that there is a violation of this article or related provisions of the City of Allegan Code of Ordinances, the building official or his designee shall investigate the complaint. Such investigation shall include, if necessary, inspection of the interior of the dwelling. Prior to inspection of the interior of a dwelling, the building official shall notify the owner, agent, or landlord, and also the tenant of the time and date of the inspection at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to said inspection. The building official does not need to give prior notice for inspections of the exterior, and the building official shall have the right to conduct unannounced exterior inspections during daylight hours of any day, except for Saturday and Sunday. All complaints requesting an interior inspection of a rental dwelling must be dated and signed by the owner or occupant specify the nature of the alleged violation and the means by which the complainant acquired direct, first-hand knowledge of the alleged violation. 
(q)	Prior to occupancy by tenants, all rental units must have interior and exterior inspections completed by the building official or his authorized agent, and must be issued a registration. Such inspection shall be scheduled within ten (10) working days following notification by the owner to the building official that the building is ready for inspection. 
(r)	A property owner, agent, landlord or city resident may appeal any order, requirement, determination or decision of the building official pertaining to the registration of rental dwellings. A fee shall be paid for each appeal to the construction board of appeals. 
(s)	Whenever, upon inspection of the registered premises, or of the records required to be kept hereunder, the building official finds that conditions or practices exist which are in violation of the provisions of this article or of any applicable rules and regulations pursuant thereto, he shall serve the owner or operator with notice of the violation in the manner provided by the Code. 
(t)	At the end of the time he has allowed for correction of any violation cited, the building official or designee shall re-inspect the premises, and if he determines that such conditions have not been corrected, he may issue an order suspending the registration. 
(u)	Any person whose license to operate a rental dwelling, multiple dwelling or rooming house, has been suspended, and shall be entitled to a reconsideration of the order or a formal hearing, in the manner provided by this article. If no request for reconsideration or petition for hearing reaches the building official within twenty-one (21) days following the issuance of the order of suspension, the registration shall be revoked, except that prior to revocation any person whose registration has been suspended may request re-inspection upon a showing that the violation or violations cited in the notice have been corrected. 
(v)	If, upon re-inspection, the building official finds that the premises in connection with which the notice was issued is now in compliance with this article and with applicable rules and regulations issued pursuant thereto, he shall reinstate the registration. A request for re-inspection shall not extend the suspension period, unless the building official grants the request.

(y)	Payment of inspection fees. All inspection fees under this section shall be the responsibility of the owner(s) of each rental unit, except as follows: 
(1)	If the inspection is based upon a complaint filed by an owner of the rental unit, and the inspection reveals to the building official that a violation was caused by the occupant(s)/tenants of the rental unit, the occupant/tenant shall be responsible for payment of the inspection fee (if the building official cannot definitely determine that the violation was caused by the occupant(s) of the rental unit, then the owner(s) shall be liable for the inspection fee); 
(2)	If the inspection is based upon a complaint made by the person other than the owner, and the inspection reveals to the building official no violation of this Code, the complainant(s) shall be responsible for the payment of the inspection fee; or 
(3)	The inspection is part of a city-wide rental unit inspection program initiated by the city council, in which case the city shall be responsible for the inspection fee. 
    In the event a rental unit has more than one (1) owner and the owners are liable for the inspection fee, or in the event a rental unit has more than one (1) occupant and the occupants are liable for the inspection fee, or in the event more than one (1) complainant files a complaint and the complainants are liable for the inspection fee, each owner or each occupant or each complainant (as the case may be) shall be jointly and severally liable for the inspection fee. A late payment charge may be established by the city council if the inspection fee is not paid within thirty (30) days after the billing date. 
(z)	Lack of valid registration. No owner shall lease, rent or otherwise allow a rental unit to be occupied unless the rental unit is properly and currently registered as required by this section 7-38. 
(aa)	Order to vacate. No person shall occupy a rental unit if the building official or designee orders that it be vacated due to one (1) or more violations of this Code. 
(bb)	Termination of registration. If the owner(s) of a rental unit fail to comply (or to force the occupant(s) of such rental unit to comply) with a notice received from the building official or designee pursuant to Chapters 7 or 16 of the City's Code of Ordinances, or if the owner(s) or occupant(s) (as the case may be) of a rental unit fail to pay within thirty (30) days a billed and outstanding registration fee and/or inspection fee assessed pursuant to this section 7-38, the building official may suspend registration for such rental unit. In such event, the building official may post the rental unit and request the city's legal counsel to proceed at law to order the premises in violation to be vacated. Also in the event the building official suspends the registration for a rental unit, the building official shall notify the occupant(s) thereof that the occupant(s) may pay rent into a self-established escrow account until vacating the rental unit or until the registration of the rental unit is either reinstated or renewed. A terminated but not yet expired registration shall be reinstated for a rental unit once the requirements of the building official's notice sent pursuant to Chapters 7 or 16 of the City's Code of Ordinance are met and all outstanding registration fees and inspection fees and late payment charges thereon have been paid in full. 
(cc)	Administrative liability. No officer, agent, employee, contractor or member of the city council shall be personally liable for any damage that may accrue to any person as a result of any act, decision or other consequence or occurrence arising out of the discharge of his or her duties and responsibilities pursuant to this Code.

The requesting party or the cable operator may seek review of the decision by filing an appeal with any appropriate forum. Disclosure will be stayed pending resolution of any appeal.

Sec. 13-6. - Demolition or moving of historic structures. 
    The demolition or moving of structures of historic or architectural worth is discouraged. The historic district commission in its discretion may approve or disapprove the demolition or moving of a structure in a historic district or site. The commission shall consider the following factors in exercising its discretion.

(2)	Whether the structure is a deterrent to a major improvement program which will be of substantial benefit to the community. 
(3)	Whether retention of the structure would cause undue financial hardship to the owner.

Sec. 13-7. - Variances. 
    This procedure which "varies" or changes the literal regulations of the zoning ordinance. The variance allows a petitioner to request a change in the regulations when he/she cannot physically meet them. Variances typically deal with lot sizes, set backs, and height restrictions. 
    Due to conditions of design and construction in historic neighborhoods where structures were often built close to the lot lines, it is in the public interest to retain a neighborhood's historic appearance by making variances which will not adversely affect neighboring properties. Where appropriate, the historic district commission may recommend to the planning commission and the zoning board of appeals that such a variance to standard yard requirements be made.

Cross reference- Administration, Ch. 2.

Sec. 13-56. - Duties and powers of historic district commission. 
    The duties and powers of the historic district commission shall be as follows: 
(1)	A permit shall be obtained before any work affecting the exterior appearance of a resource is performed within a historic district. The applicant to do the work shall file an application for a permit with the building official. If the building official determines that the application requires approval by the commission, the application shall be referred to the commission, together with all supporting material that makes the application complete to the commission. A permit shall not be issued and proposed work shall not proceed until the commission has acted on the application by issuing a certificate of appropriateness or a notice to proceed. (Ordinary maintenance and ordinary landscaping shall not be subject to the review and approval of the commission.) 
(2)	The commission shall have the power to consult with experts when necessary to aid in its deliberations. 
(3)	Upon the finding by and recommendation of the commission that a historic resource with a historic district is threatened with demolition by neglect, which means neglect in maintaining, repairing or securing a resource or the loss of structural integrity of the resource, the commission may do either of the following: 
a.	Require the owner of the resource to repair all conditions contributing to the demolition by neglect. 
b.	If the owner does not make repairs within a reasonable time, the building official or his agents may enter the property and make such repairs as are necessary to prevent demolition by neglect. The costs of the work shall be charged to the owner and may be levied by the local unit as a special assessment against the property. The building official or his agent may enter the property for purposes of this section upon obtaining an order from the district court. 
(4)	The commission may delegate the issuance of certificates of appropriateness for specified minor classes of work to the building official. The commission shall provide to the building official specific written standards for issuing certificates of appropriateness. The commission shall review the certificates of appropriateness on at least a quarterly basis. 
(5)	When work has been done upon a resource without a permit, and the commission finds that the work does not qualify for a certificate of appropriateness, a municipal civil infraction may be issued in accordance with section 13-90. In addition to issuing a municipal civil infraction, the commission may require an owner to restore the resource to the condition the resource was in before the inappropriate work or to modify the work so that it qualifies for a certificate of appropriateness. If the owner does not comply with the restoration or modification requirement within a reasonable time, as prescribed by the commission, the council may seek an order from the district court to require the owner to restore the resource to its former condition or to modify the work so that it qualifies for a certificate of appropriateness. If the owner fails to comply with the court order, the council or its agents may obtain a court order permitting the city or its agents to enter the property to perform work necessary to restore the resource to its former condition or modify the work so that it qualifies for a certificate of appropriateness in accordance with the court's order. The court may also, in its discretion, order that the property be vacated until all work necessary to restore the resource has been completed. The costs of the work shall be charged to the owner and may be levied by the local unit as a special assessment against the property. When acting pursuant to an order of the court, the council or its agents may enter property for purposes of this section. 
(6)	The commission shall review and act upon only the exterior features of a resource the commission considers valuable to the city, state or nation, and [if] the commission determines that the alteration or loss of that resource will adversely affect the public purposes of the city, state or nation, the commission shall attempt to establish with the owner of the resource an economically feasible plan for preservation of the resource. 
(7)	Work within a historic district shall be permitted through the issuance of a notice to proceed by the commission if any of the following conditions prevail and if the proposed work can be demonstrated by a finding of the commission to be necessary to substantially improve or correct any of the following conditions: 
a.	The resource constitutes a hazard to the safety of the public or to the structure's occupants. 
b.	The resource is a deterrent to a major improvement program that will be of a substantial benefit to the community and the applicant proposing the work has obtained all the necessary planning and zoning approvals, financing and environmental clearances. 
c.	Retaining the resource will cause undue financial hardship to the owner when a governmental action, an act of God, or other events beyond the owner's control created the hardship and all feasible alternatives to eliminate the financial hardship, which may include offering the resource for sale at its fair market value or moving the resource to vacant site within the historic district, have been attempted and exhausted by the owner. 
d.	Retaining the resource is not in the interest of the majority of the community.
(8)	Local public officials and employees shall provide information and records to committees, commissions, and standing committees and shall meet with those bodies upon request to assist with their activities. 
(9)	The historic district commission or duly appointed committee shall prepare and keep current an inventory of the historic sites and buildings in the city which, in its judgment, have such historical value as to warrant preservation, to publish such inventory, and to cooperate with the owners of such sites and buildings in devising and carrying out appropriate means for their preservation, including, but not limited to, consideration for National Register nomination and inclusion in or creation of a historic district or site, subject to the provisions contained in section 13-60. 
(Ord. No. 304, 12-27-94; Ord. No. 307, § 2, 10-9-95; Ord. No. 339, § 1, 6-22-98; Ord. No. 403, § 1, 12-26-07) 
Sec. 13-57. - Preservation standards. 
    The standards (Department of Interior Regulations, 36 CFR 67), pertain to historic buildings of all materials, construction types, sizes and occupancy and encompass the exterior related landscape features and the building's site and environment as well as attached, adjacent, or related new construction. The standards are to be applied to specific rehabilitation projects in a reasonable manner, taking into consideration economic and technical feasibility. 
(1)	A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment. 
(2)	The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided. 
(3)	Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features of architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken. 
(4)	Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved. 
(5)	Distinctive features, finishes and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property [that] shall be preserved. 
(6)	Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence. 
(7)	Chemical and physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible. 
(8)	Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken. 
(9)	New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment. 
(10)	New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired. 
(11)	Every reasonable attempt shall be made to preserve structures in a manner which requires minimal alteration to original building design. 
(12)	Construction or modification work shall not, except where necessary for purposes of safety or efficiency, nullify the distinguishing qualities of the property and its environment. The removal or alteration of architectural features of special historical significance shall be held to a minimum. 
(13)	Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced whenever possible. Repaired or replaced features shall duplicate original features. 
(14)	New development, including exterior remodeling, shall:
a.	Respect the architectural and structural integrity of the historic district or site in which work is undertaken through sympathetic use of style, material and color; 
b.	Respect the appearance of the streetscape as a whole by harmonizing the design and appearance of the facades of individual structures within the overall design and appearance of the streetscape. 
(15)	Unpainted aluminum and exposed concrete masonry, other than masonry foundations, which are not characteristic of historic districts and sites identified in this chapter are prohibited. 
(16)	The replacement of lost architectural features with the original feature or features similar to the original shall be strongly encouraged. 
(17)	The height, bulk and character of new structures shall be visually compatible with adjacent structures, as defined by the city zoning ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 304, 12-27-94)
Sec. 13-58. - Regulations for proposed exterior signs. 
    All proposed exterior signs in an historic district or site shall be subject to approval by the historic district commission and shall be governed by the following regulations: 
(1)	All signs are subject to the provisions of chapter 23. 
(2)	To ensure that the scale, shape and type of signs are consistent with the character of the historic district or site, the following sign standards shall govern: 
a.	Message-permitted signs shall be restricted to those signs which identify the name of the establishment and/or the primary business or service provided within it. Advertising relating to businesses or services not provided on the premises shall be prohibited, unless at the discretion of the historic district commission, such advertising is historically appropriate. In the case of buildings occupied by professional offices, signs may list occupants. 
b.	Internally lit signs, flashing signs and signs that otherwise appear to be in motion are prohibited. Banners and flags bearing emblems, symbols or messages shall be permitted on an interim basis and annually reviewed to ensure their sightly appearance. 
c.	Signs shall not be placed so as to conceal or disfigure any architectural feature of a building. The style and size of all signs shall be visually compatible with the buildings on which they are attached. Painted and metal signs, wood signs, glass signs, and signs painted on masonry and other materials approved by the commission are permitted. 
(Ord. No. 304, 12-27-94)
Sec. 13-59. - Programs and information. 
(a)	The historic district commission may recommend to the council the establishment of incentive programs to encourage preservation of historic structures and an appropriate system of markers for historic structures and areas; advise owners or residents of historically or architecturally significant structures or areas of problems, techniques and resources regarding historic preservation; make recommendations concerning the preparation of maps, brochures and descriptive material about structures and areas of historic or architectural significance; and promote the public interest in historic preservation by carrying on a public information program. 
(b)	The commission shall make available to the general public information on the nomination process and selection criteria for the National Register program. When a resource is considered for nomination, the commission shall provide opportunity for public comment at a regular or special commission meeting to review the same. Written notice will be mailed to the property owner providing date, time, and place of meeting in compliance with P.A. 267 of 1976. The commission shall then be responsible for preparing a report stating which, if any, of the National Register's selection criteria are met by the resource, and if it meets the Register's standards of integrity. This report will be mailed to the state historic preservation office and to the property owner within sixty (60) days after receipt of the nomination, along with the mayor's personal recommendation.

Sec. 13-60. - Boundaries of district; changes or additions to districts or sites. 
(a)	The council, with recommendation from the commission, may at any time establish by ordinance, additional historic districts, including proposed districts previously considered and rejected, may modify boundaries of an existing historic district or may eliminate an existing historic district. Before establishing, modifying or eliminating a historic district, a historic district study committee appointed by the council shall, except as provided in subsection (b), comply with the procedures set forth in section (3) of the State Enabling Statute and shall consider any previously written committee reports pertinent to the proposed action. To conduct these activities, council may retain the initial committee, establish a standing committee, or establish a committee to consider only specific proposed districts and then be dissolved. 
(b)	If considering elimination of a historic district, a committee shall follow the procedures set forth in section (3) of the State Enabling Statute for issuing a preliminary report, holding a public hearing and issuing a final report but with the intent of showing one (1) or more of the following: 
(1)	The historic district has lost those physical characteristics that enabled establishment of the districts. 
(2)	The historic district was not significant in the way it was defined.
(3)	The historic district was established pursuant to defective procedures.
(c)	Upon receipt of submittal evidence showing the presence of historic, architectural, archaeological, engineering, or cultural significance of a proposed historic district, the council may, at its discretion, adopt a resolution requiring that all applications for permits within the proposed historic district be referred to the commission as required in this chapter. The commission shall review permit applications with the same powers that would apply if the proposed historic district was an established historic district. The review may continue in the proposed historic district for not more than one (1) year, or until such time as the City of Allegan approves or rejects the establishment of the historic district by ordinance, whichever occurs first. 
(d)	If the council determines that pending work will cause irreparable harm to historical resources located within an established or proposed historic district, the council may by resolution declare an emergency moratorium of all such work for a period not to exceed six (6) months. The council may extend the emergency moratorium for an additional period of six (6) months upon finding that the threat of irreparable harm to resources is still present. Any pending permit application concerning a resource subject to an emergency moratorium may be summarily denied.

ARTICLE II. - FREESTANDING OUTDOOR FURNACES 

Sec. 16-100. - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to ban the construction and operation of outdoor furnaces within the limits of the City of Allegan for the purpose of securing and promoting the public health, comfort, convenience, safety, welfare and prosperity of the city and its inhabitants. It is generally recognized that the types of fuel used and the scale and duration of the burning by such furnaces create noxious and hazardous smoke, soot, fumes, odors, air pollution, particles, and other products of combustion that can be detrimental to citizens' health and can deprive neighboring residents of the enjoyment of their property or premises. It is generally recognized that these units are designed for long burn times between loading. It is generally recognized that the designed restricted airflow, low operating temperatures, lack of emission controls, and large fuel loads frequently result in excessive smoke. Under some conditions smoke can cause both acute and chronic health problems to other residents if they are exposed to the smoke.

(3)	This article shall not be a defense to any civil claims.
(4)	This section shall not apply to any freestanding outdoor furnace designed for structure heat that was installed, connected, and operating as of the effective date of this section. However, this section shall not be deemed as specific authorization for the use of any preexisting freestanding outdoor furnace designed for structure heat and shall not be deemed to bar, limit, or otherwise affect the rights of any person to take private or legal action regarding damage or nuisance caused by the use of a freestanding outdoor furnace designed for structure heat.

The same proceedings shall be followed in making a new roll as in the making of the original roll. If, after hearing all objections and making a record of such changes as the council deems justified, the council determines that it is satisfied with the special assessment roll and that assessments are in proportion to benefits received, they shall thereupon pass a resolution reciting such determinations, confirming such roll, placing it on file in the office of the city clerk, and directing the city clerk to attach a warrant to a certified copy thereof within ten (10) days, therein commanding the city assessor to spread and the city treasurer to collect the various sums and amounts appearing thereon as directed by the council.

Sec. 27-13. - Partial payments, when due. 
    The council may provide for the payment of special assessments in annual installments. Such annual installments shall not exceed thirty (30), the first installment being due upon confirmation of the roll or on such date as the council may determine and deferred installments being due annually thereafter, or in the discretion of the council, may be spread upon and made a part of each annual city tax roll thereafter until all are paid. Interest shall be charged on all deferred installments at a rate per annum to be set by the council, commencing on such date as shall be established by the council. The full amount of all or any deferred installments, with interest accrued thereon to the date of payment, may be paid in advance of the due dates thereof. If the full assessment or the first installment thereof shall be due upon confirmation, each property owner shall have thirty (30) days from the date of confirmation to pay the full amount of the assessment, or the full amount of any installments thereof, without interest or penalty. Following the thirty-day period, the assessment, or first installment thereof shall, if unpaid, be considered as delinquent and the same penalty shall be collected on such unpaid assessments or first installments thereof as are provided by law to be collected on delinquent general city taxes. Deferred installments shall be collected without penalty until thirty (30) days after the due date thereof, after which time such installments shall be considered as delinquent and such penalties on the installments shall be collected as provided by law to be collected on delinquent general city taxes. After the council has confirmed the roll, the city treasurer shall notify by mail each property owner on the roll that the roll has been filed, stating the amount assessed and the terms of payment. Failure on the part of city treasurer to give such notice or of such owner to receive the notice shall not invalidate any special assessment roll of the city or any assessment thereon, nor excuse the payment of interest or penalties.

Sec. 27-14. - Delinquent special assessments. 
    Any assessment, or part thereof, remaining unpaid sixty (60) days following the date when the same became delinquent shall be reported as unpaid by the city treasurer to the council. Any such delinquent assessment shall be transferred and reassessed on the next tax roll, whether city or otherwise, in a column headed "special assessments" with a penalty of four (4) percent, plus accrued interest from the due date, upon such total amount added thereto, and when so transferred and reassessed upon the tax roll shall be collected in all respects as provided for the collection of city taxes.

Sec. 27-15. - Creation of lien. 
    Special assessments and all interest, penalties, and charges thereon from the date of confirmation of the roll shall become a debt to the city from the persons to whom they are assessed, and, until paid, shall be and remain a lien upon the property assessed, of the same character and effect as the lien created by general law for state, county, and city taxes and the lands on which the same are a lien shall be subject to sale therefor the same as are lands upon which delinquent city taxes constitute a lien. 
(Ord. No. 254, § 1, 4-10-89)
Sec. 27-16. - Additional assessment; refunds. 
    The city manager shall, within sixty (60) days after the completion of each local or special public improvement, certify to the city treasurer that the public improvement has been completed and the treasurer shall compile the actual cost thereof and certify the same to the assessor who shall adjust the special assessment roll to correspond therewith. Should the assessment prove larger than necessary by less than five (5) percent, the same shall be presented to the council which may place the excess in the city treasury or make a refund thereof pro rata according to the assessment. If the assessment exceeds the amount necessary by five (5) percent or more, the entire excess shall be credited to owners of property as shown by the city assessment roll upon which such assessment has been levied, pro rata according to the assessment. No refunds of special assessments may be made which impair or contravene the provision of any outstanding obligation or bond secured in whole or in part by such special assessments. In the case of assessments due in installments, the council may order the refund be given by credit against the installments last coming due. When any special assessment roll shall prove insufficient to meet the cost of the improvement for which it was made, the council may make an additional pro rata assessment after compliance with the provisions hereof and a public hearing, but the total amount assessed against any one parcel of land shall not exceed the benefits received by the lot or parcel of land. 
(Ord. No. 254, § 1, 4-10-89)
Sec. 27-17. - Additional procedures. 
    In any case where the provisions of this article may prove to be insufficient to carry out fully the making of any special assessment, the council shall provide, by ordinance, any additional steps or procedures required.

Sec. 27-18. - Collection of special assessments. 
    In the event bonds are issued in anticipation of the collection of special assessments as hereinbefore provided, all collections on each special assessment or combination of rolls shall be set in a separate fund for the payment of the principal and interest on the bonds so issued in anticipation of the payment of such special assessments, and shall be used for no other purpose. 
(Ord. No. 254, § 1, 4-10-89)
Sec. 27-19. - Special assessment accounts. 
    Moneys raised by special assessment to pay the cost of any local improvement shall be held in a special fund to pay such cost or to repay any money borrowed therefor. Each special assessment account must be used only for the improvement project for which the assessment was levied, expenses incidental thereto, including the repayment of the principal and interest on money borrowed therefor, and to refund excessive assessments, if refunds be authorized. 
(Ord. No. 254, § 1, 4-10-89)
Sec. 27-20. - Contested assessments. 
    An action may not be instituted for the purpose of contesting or enjoining the collection of a special assessment unless: (a) within forty-five (45) days after the confirmation of the special assessment roll, written notice is given to the council indicating an intention to file such an action and stating the grounds on which it is claimed that the assessment is illegal; and (b) the action is commenced within ninety (90) days after the confirmation of the roll. 
(Ord. No. 254, § 1, 4-10-89)
Sec. 27-21. - Reassessment for benefits. 
    Whenever the council shall deem any special assessment invalid or defective for any reason whatever, or if any court of competent jurisdiction shall have adjudged such assessment to be illegal for any reason whatever, in whole or in part, the council shall have power to cause a new assessment to be made for the same purpose for which the former assessment was made, whether the improvement or any part thereof has been completed and whether any part of the assessment has been collected or not. All proceedings on such reassessment and for the collection thereof shall be made in the manner as provided for the original assessment. If any portion of the original assessment shall have been collected and not refunded, it shall be applied upon the reassessment and the reassessment shall to that extent be deemed satisfied. If more than the amount reassessed shall have been collected, the balance shall be refunded to the person making such payment. 
(Ord. No. 254, § 1, 4-10-89)
Sec. 27-22. - Combination of projects.

(Ord. No. 254, § 1, 4-10-89)
Sec. 27-23. - Division of parcels. 
    Should any lots or lands be divided after a special assessment thereon has been confirmed and divided into installments, the city treasurer and the city assessor shall apportion the uncollected amounts upon the several lots and lands so divided and shall enter the several amounts as amendments upon the special assessment roll. The city treasurer shall, within ten (10) days after such apportionment, send notice of such action to the persons concerned at their last known address by first class mail. The apportionment shall be final and conclusive on all parties unless protest in writing is received by the city treasurer within twenty-one (21) days of the mailing of the aforesaid notice.

It is further acknowledged that such housing for persons of low income is a public necessity, and as the city will be benefitted and improved by such housing, the encouragement of the same by providing certain real estate tax exemption for such housing is a valid public purpose; further, that the continuance of the provisions of this division for tax exemption and the service charge in lieu of taxes during the periods contemplated in this division are essential to the determination of economic feasibility of housing developments which are constructed and financed in reliance on such division and service charge.

The authorization must specify either an individual or a position having responsibility for the overall operation of the facility (such as the position of plant manager, operator of a well or well field, or a position of equivalent responsibility, or having overall responsibility for the environmental matters for the company or entity). The written authorization must be submitted to the POTW superintendent prior to or together with any reports to be signed by the authorized representative. 
(2)	If an authorization under [subsection] (d)(1) above is no longer accurate because a different individual or position has responsibility for the overall operation of the facility, or overall responsibility for environmental matters for the company or entity, a new written authorization must be submitted to the POTW superintendent prior to or together with any reports to be signed by the newly authorized representative. 
    Best management practice or BMP means any practice, program, procedure, control, technique or measure (used singularly or in combination), that a user is required to adopt or implement to control, contain, treat, prevent, or reduce the discharge of wastewater, pollutants or other substances to the POTW, as determined necessary by the POTW superintendent. BMPs include, but are not limited to: schedules of activities; pollution treatment practices or devices; prohibitions of practices; good housekeeping practices; pollution prevention, minimization and reduction measures; educational practices and programs; maintenance procedures; other management programs, practices or devices; treatment requirements; notice, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements; and operating procedures and practices to control or contain site runoff, spillage or leaks, batch discharges, sludge or water disposal, or drainage from product and raw materials storage. BMPs may be structural, nonstructural, or both. In determining what BMPs will be required of a user in a particular case, the POTW superintendent may consider all relevant technological, economic, practical, and institutional considerations as determined relevant and appropriate by the superintendent, consistent with achieving and maintaining compliance with the requirements of this division and other applicable laws and regulations. 
    BOD (denoting biochemical oxygen demand) means the quantity of dissolved oxygen used in the biochemical oxidation of organic matter under standard laboratory procedure in five (5) days at twenty (20) degrees C., expressed in milligrams per liter. 
    Building drain means that part of the lowest horizontal piping of a drainage system which receives the discharge from soil, waste and other drainage pipes inside the walls of a building and conveys it to a building sewer.

    City manager means the city manager of the city or the city manager's authorized representatives. 
    City permit agent means the permit agent of the city or the city permit agent's authorized representatives. 
    COD. A measure of oxygen-consuming capacity of inorganic and organic matter present in water or wastewater. It is expressed as the amount of oxygen consumed from a chemical oxidant in a specified test. It does not differentiate between stable and unstable organic matter and thus does not necessarily correlate with biochemical oxygen demand. Also known as oxygen consumed (OCR) and dichromate oxygen consumed (DO), respectively. 
    Combined sewer means a sewer intended to receive both wastewater and stormwater. 
    Compatible pollutant means a pollutant which, as determined by the POTW superintendent, is susceptible to effective treatment by the POTW as designed, and which will not interfere with, or pass through, the POTW, and which is otherwise not incompatible with the treatment processes or in excess of the capacity at the POTW. The term "compatible" is a relative concept that must be determined on a case-by-case basis. In determining whether or not a pollutant is compatible with the POTW, the superintendent may consider, without limitation, the nature and qualities of the pollutant, and the concentration, mass, and flow rate at which the pollutant is (or is proposed to be) discharged. Thus, for example, even pollutants such as BOD, fats, oils or grease, phosphorous, suspended solids, and fecal coliform bacteria, which are typically considered "compatible" may be determined incompatible, if discharged in concentrations or flows that would cause interference or pass through or exceed the POTW's capacity. Specifically excluded from the definition of compatible pollutant are "heavy" metals, PCBs, and any pollutants that will likely contribute or cause operational or sludge disposal problems or unacceptable discharges to the receiving waters. 
    Composite sample means a series of individual samples, collected on a flow- or time-proportional basis, taken at regular intervals over a specific time period and combined into a single sample (formed either by continuous sampling or by mixing discrete samples) representative of the average stream during the sampling period. For categorical sampling, a composite sample shall consist of at least four (4) individual samples taken within a twenty-four-hour period. 
    Cooling water means water used for cooling purposes only, including both contact and noncontact cooling water. 
    Cooling water (contact) means water used for cooling purposes only that may become contaminated or polluted either through the use of water treatment chemicals (such as corrosion inhibitors or biocides) or by direct contact with process materials and/or wastewater. 
    Cooling water (noncontact) means water used for cooling purposes only that has no direct contact with any raw material, intermediate product, final product, or waste, and that does not contain a detectable level of contaminants higher than that of the intake water (for example, the water discharged from uses such as air conditioning, cooling, or refrigeration, or to which the only pollutant added is heat). 
    Daily maximum means the maximum discharge of pollutants or flow (expressed in terms of concentration, mass loading, pounds, gallons or other unit of measurement) that shall not be exceeded on any single calendar day. Where daily maximum limitations are expressed in terms of a concentration, the daily discharge is the arithmetic average measurement of the pollutant concentration derived from all measurements taken that day. Where daily maximum limitations are expressed in units of mass, the daily discharge is the total mass discharged during the day. If a composite sample is required for a parameter, the determination whether the daily maximum limitation for that parameter has been exceeded on a single calendar day shall be based on the composite sample collected for that parameter on that calendar day. If grab samples are required for a parameter, the determination whether the daily maximum limitation for that parameter has been exceeded on a calendar day shall be based on the average of all grab samples collected for that parameter on that calendar day. If only one grab sample is collected for a parameter on a given day, the determination whether the daily maximum limitation for that parameter has been exceeded for the day shall be based on the results of that single grab sample. (Compliance with applicable minimum and maximum limits for pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) shall be determined based on instantaneous measurements only, and not on averaged results.). 
    Days means, for purposes of computing a period of time prescribed or allowed by this division, consecutive calendar days. 
    Dilute means to weaken, thin down or reduce the concentration of pollutants in wastewater. 
    Director of the department of public works or DPW director means the director of the city's department of public works or the director's authorized representatives. 
    Discharge means the introduction of waste, wastewater, effluent, or pollutants into the POTW, whether intentional or unintentional, and whether directly (such as through an approved sewer connection or other approved discharge point as authorized by this division) or indirectly (including, but not limited to, sources such as inflow and infiltration). 
    Domestic user means a user that discharges only segregated normal strength domestic waste into the POTW. 
    Domestic waste means wastewater (or water-carried waste) of human origin generated by personal activities from toilet, kitchen, laundry, or bathing facilities, or by other similar facilities used for household or residential dwelling purposes ("sanitary sewage"). Domestic waste shall not include any waste resulting from industrial or commercial processes, including, without limitation, any hazardous or toxic pollutants. Wastes that emanate from sources other than residential dwelling units may be considered domestic wastes only if they are of the same nature and strength and have the same flow rate characteristics as wastes that emanate from residential dwelling units. 
    Effluent means wastewater or other liquid, partially or completely treated, flowing from a reservoir, basin, treatment process or treatment plant. 
    EPA means the United States Environmental Protection Agency. 
    Excessive means at such a flow, rate, magnitude or amount that, in the judgment of the POTW superintendent, it may cause damage to any facility or the POTW; may be harmful to the wastewater treatment processes; may adversely affect the management or operation of the POTW or POTW sludge management or disposal; may cause pass through or interference; may violate any pretreatment standard or requirement; may adversely affect the quality of the receiving waters or the ambient air quality; may endanger worker health and safety; may constitute a public nuisance; may be inconsistent with the requirements, purposes or objectives of this division; or may otherwise adversely impact the public health, safety or welfare or the environment. 
    Existing source means any source of discharge that is not a new source as defined by this division. 
    Fats or FOG means fats, oil or grease consisting of any hydrocarbons, fatty acids, soaps, fats, waxes, oils, or any other nonvolatile material of animal, vegetable or mineral origin that is extractable by solvents in accordance with standard methods. 
    Flow-proportional composite sample means a combination of individual samples of equal volume taken at equal intervals of flow without consideration of the time between individual samples. 
    Garbage means solid wastes from the preparation, cooking, serving, or dispensing of food, from the handling, storage, processing or sale of produce, or from the canning or packaging of food. It is composed largely of putrescible organic matter and its natural or added moisture content. 
    General user permit means a permit issued to any user other than a significant industrial user as provided by this division to control discharges to the POTW and to ensure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
    Grab sample means an individual sample that is taken from a wastestream on a one-time basis without regard to the flow in the wastestream and over a period of time not to exceed fifteen (15) minutes. 
    Grinder pump means, in a grinder pump system, the device to which the building sewer connects and which grinds and pumps the sewage to the public sewer for transportation to the POTW. 
    Grinder pump system means the publicly owned grinder pump, controls and pressure discharge pipe, including all control boards, controls, floats, pumps, storage tanks and appurtenances thereto which provides the connection between the privately owned building sewer and the public sewer system.

Subdivision 6. - Regulation of Discharges to the POTW 

Sec. 29-149. - Discharge prohibitions. 
    No user shall discharge to the POTW except in compliance with this division. 
    The general discharge prohibitions under subsection (A) and the specific discharge prohibitions under subsection (B) apply to every user whether or not the user is subject to any other national, state or local pretreatment standards or requirements, and whether or not the discharge is made pursuant to a user permit issued pursuant to this division. 
(A)	General prohibitions. No user shall contribute or cause to be contributed, directly or indirectly to the POTW, any pollutant or wastewater that will pass through or interfere with the operation or performance of the POTW. 
(B)	Specific prohibitions. No user shall discharge or contribute to the POTW, directly or indirectly, any of the pollutants, substances, or wastewater as provided by this subsection. This subsection sets forth the minimum requirements for a user's discharges to the POTW. Additional or more restrictive requirements may be required of particular users by a user permit, or as otherwise authorized or required by this division or other applicable laws and regulations. 
(1)	Concentration limits. Except as otherwise provided by subsection (B)(2), pollutants in concentrations that exceed the daily maximum or monthly average concentrations listed below in this subsection: 
ParameterIMC
(mg/l)1 Daily Max.
(mg/l)1 Monthly Avg.
(mg/l)1 Arsenic--0.5-Cadmium--0.5-Chromium(T)--2.0-Chromium (Hexavalent)--0.1-Copper--1.0-Cyanide (Amenable)--0.1-Lead--0.4-MercuryNQ2 NQ2 -Nickel--1.0-Silver--0.5-Tin--3.0-Zinc--3.0-Ammonia Nitrogen
(NH3 as N)--50.0-BOD5 --300.03-Phosphorous(T)--20.04-TSS--250.05-FOG--1006- 
Notes: 
IMC = Instantaneous Maximum Concentration Limit. 
T = Total 
1.	Discharges which contain more than one pollutant which may contribute to fume toxicity shall be subject to more restrictive limitations, as determined necessary by the POTW. The more restrictive discharge limits will be calculated based on the additive fume toxicity of all compounds identified or reasonably expected to be present in the discharge, including, without limitation, the specific compounds, if any, listed in subsection (B). 
Also, see section 29-153, regarding application of most restrictive or additional standards or requirements under local, state, and federal laws and regulations. 
2.	NQ = Nonquantifiable concentration, defined as at or below the quantification level of 0.2 ug/l using U.S. EPA method 245.1 (or at or below other quantification levels applicable under alternative test methods required by the POTW or by other applicable laws or regulations). Mercury sampling procedures, preservation and handling, and analytical protocol for compliance monitoring of a user's discharge shall be in accordance with U.S. EPA method 245.1, unless the POTW superintendent requires U.S. EPA method 1631 (or other appropriate method). The quantification level shall be 0.2 ug/l for method 245.1 or 0.5 ng/l for method 1631, unless higher levels are approved by the POTW superintendent because of sample matrix interference. 
3.	Any discharge of BOD in excess of two hundred (200.0) mg/l shall be subject to surcharge as provided by this division. 
4.	Any discharge of phosphorous (T) in excess of ten (10.0 )mg/l shall be subject to surcharge as provided by this division. 
5.	Any discharge of TSS in excess of two hundred fifty (250.0) mg/l shall be subject to surcharge as provided by this division. 
6.	Any discharge of FOG in excess of fifty (50.0) mg/l shall be subject to surcharge as provided by this division. 
The IMC, daily maximum, and monthly average limits listed above in this subsection (B)(1) parameter are the concentrations which may not be exceeded and at which enforcement begins. The surcharge threshold concentrations as specified in notes 3 through 7 [6] (above) are the concentrations above which surcharges may be imposed. Discharges exceeding the surcharge thresholds, but which are less than the IMC, daily maximum, and monthly average limits (and which do not violate any other applicable prohibitions, limitations, standards, or requirements), are not violations of this division, but are subject to surcharges as provided by this division. All violations of applicable discharge prohibitions and limitations and all instances of noncompliance with applicable discharge requirements constitute a violation of this division, subject to applicable fines, penalties and other enforcement actions. In no event shall the imposition of a surcharge for a discharge which does not meet the applicable prohibitions, limitations or requirements be construed as authorizing the illegal discharge or otherwise excuse a violation of this division. 
(2)	Headworks mass limits. In place of using the concentration limits provided in subsection (B)(1), the POTW superintendent may allocate specified portions of the available total load to individual users as provided by this subsection (B)(2). 
(a)	As of the effective date of this chapter [division], the following total loads are available for the following pollutant parameters: 
ParameterDaily Maximum
Load Limit
(total lbs/day)Monthly Average
Load Limit
(total lbs/day)BOD5 9,4378,200TSS2,136-Ammonia Nitrogen
(NH3 as N)59-Phosphorus (T)35- 
(b)	The POTW superintendent may allocate portions of the available total load for one or more of the parameters listed above to one or more individual users. The amounts of the load(s) allocated to each user shall be specified in the user's user permit, along with any conditions as determined necessary by the POTW superintendent. Any discharge by a user in excess of the loading allocated to the user in the user permit shall constitute a violation of the user permit and this chapter [division]. 
(c)	Before allocating any amount of the available total load as provided by this section, the POTW superintendent must determine that the proposed allocation will not cause the average composite loading of all users discharging to the POTW to exceed the available total loading for any pollutant as provided by subsection (B)(2)(a); will not interfere with the POTW's ability to accept and treat wastewater as required by the POTW's NPDES permit and other applicable laws and regulations; and that the allocation is otherwise reasonable and appropriate under all of the circumstances. 
(d)	If the POTW superintendent allocates a portion of the available total loading for some, but not all, of the pollutants listed subsection (B)(2)(a) to a user, any pollutants not allocated a portion of the available total loading shall be subject to the concentration limits provided by subsection (B)(1). 
(e)	The allocation of a portion of available total load for a pollutant to an individual user shall not affect the applicability of surcharges to the user's discharge of that pollutant as provided by subsection (B)(1). 
(f)	Except as otherwise expressly provided by this section, an allocation of load for a pollutant parameter shall not affect a user's obligation to comply with the requirements and standards of this chapter [division] and other applicable laws and regulations. 
(3)	Pollutants in concentrations that exceed the instantaneous maximum, daily maximum or monthly average concentrations listed below in this subsection: 
Parameter: 
PCBs: The instantaneous maximum concentration, daily maximum and monthly average discharge limit for PCBs is nondetect. Except as otherwise required by the POTW superintendent, compliance with this limit shall be determined as follows: 
A compliance limit of "nondetect" shall be used for instantaneous maximum concentration, daily maximum and monthly average. Any discharge of PCBs at or above the quantification level is a specific violation of this division. 
PCB sampling procedures, preservation and handling, and analytical protocol for compliance monitoring of a user's discharge shall be in accordance with U.S. EPA method 608. The quantification level shall be 0.1 ug/l, unless higher levels are determined appropriate by the POTW superintendent because of sample matrix interference. Total PCBs shall be defined as the sum of the aroclors 1016, 1221, 1232, 1242, 1248, 1254 and 1260. In addition, any detected aroclorspecific measurements shall be reported. 
(4)	Any liquid, solid, gas or other pollutant (including, but not limited to, gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel or fuel oil) which by reason of its nature or quantity is sufficient either alone or by interaction with other substances to create a fire or explosion hazard or be injurious in any other way to persons, the POTW, or to the operation of the sewerage system, including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed cup flashpoint of less than 140º F or 60º C using test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21. 
(5)	Pollutants that may cause corrosive structural damage to the POTW, or that due to their corrosive properties are capable of causing injury to persons or POTW personnel or harm to fish, animals or the environment. Discharges that have a pH lower than 6.0 s.u. (instantaneous minimum) or greater than 11.5 s.u. (instantaneous maximum) shall not be discharged, except as follows: If a User is not regulated by state or federal categorical pretreatment standards for pH, and pH is continuously monitored, then the user may discharge wastewater with a pH less than 6.0 s.u. but greater than 5.0 s.u. for a period of time up to fifteen (15) consecutive minutes. Dischargers that use this method are subject to enforcement under subsection 29-228(H). Compliance with applicable minimum and maximum limits for pH shall be determined based on instantaneous measurements only, and not on averaged results. 
(6)	Any solid, insoluble or viscous substance in concentrations or quantities which may cause obstruction to the flow in the POTW, may create an encumbrance to the POTW operations, or which otherwise may result in interference, including, but not limited to, grease, animal entrails or tissues, bones, hair, hides or fleshings, whole blood, feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, cement, spent lime, stone or marble dust, metal, glass, straw, shavings, grass clippings, rags, strings, fibers, spent grains, spent hops, wastepaper, wood, plastics, tar, asphalt residues, residues from refining or processing of fuel or lubricating oil, mud or glass grinding or polishing wastes or tumbling and deburring stones; or any material that can be disposed of as trash. 
(7)	Any pollutant, including, but not limited to, oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.), released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration that may cause pass through or interference with the POTW or constitute a slug load, or is otherwise discharged to the POTW in excessive amounts. 
(8)	Wastewater (or vapor) having a temperature that will inhibit biological activity in the POTW resulting in interference, or heat in such quantities that the temperature at any lift station or at the POTW treatment plant exceeds 104º Fahrenheit (40º C). No discharge to the POTW shall have a temperature less than 40º Fahrenheit (4.4º C) or greater than 135º Fahrenheit (57.2º C), unless approved in advance by the POTW superintendent. 
(9)	Petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin in amounts that will cause interference or pass through. 
(10)	Pollutants that result in the presence of gases, vapors or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, wastewaters which contain liquids, solids or gases that cause gases, vapors or fumes from the discharge to exceed ten (10) percent of the immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) concentration. Discharges which contain more than one pollutant which may contribute to fume toxicity shall be subject to more restrictive limitations, as determined necessary by the POTW. The more restrictive discharge limits shall be calculated based on the additive fume toxicity of all compounds identified or reasonably expected to be present in the discharge. 
(11)	Trucked or hauled pollutants, except those introduced into the system at discharge points designated by the POTW, subject to the prior approval of the POTW superintendent and prior issuance of a user permit. 
(a)	The POTW superintendent shall determine whether to allow the discharge of trucked or hauled pollutants based on the particular nature, character or quantity of the proposed discharge in accordance with the discharge prohibitions, limitations and requirements provided by this subdivision. 
(b)	The POTW superintendent may impose any conditions on the discharge determined necessary to ensure compliance with this subdivision, including, without limitation, conditions regarding the time, place, and manner of discharge, restrictions on the quantity and quality of the discharge, and sampling requirements. 
(c)	The discharge shall not commence without prior notice to, and authorization from, the POTW superintendent, and a representative of the POTW shall be present at all times during the discharge. 
(d)	All trucked or hauled wastes to be discharged to the POTW must be accompanied by a completed waste manifest form signed by the permittee and the hauler as provided by the minimum requirements of this section. The permittee shall certify in writing on the manifest as to the source of all wastes in the load proposed to be discharged and that the wastes have been pretreated as required by applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. The hauler shall certify in writing on the manifest that no wastes other than those listed on the manifest have been accepted by the hauler. The manifest must be reviewed by the POTW superintendent prior to commencing discharge of the load. Failure to accurately record every load, falsification of data, or failure to transmit the form to the POTW superintendent for review prior to discharge shall constitute a violation of the permit and may result in revocation of the permit and/or the imposition of fines and penalties as provided by this subdivision. 
(e)	The permittee's discharge of hauled wastes shall be subject to sampling by the POTW at any time, including, without limitation, prior to and during discharge. The POTW superintendent may require the permittee to refrain from, or suspend, discharging until the sample analysis is complete. 
(f)	Trucked or hauled pollutants will be accepted only if transported to the POTW in compliance with state and federal hazardous waste and liquid industrial waste laws. 
(g)	Each discharge of trucked or hauled pollutants will be accepted only after payment to the POTW of a trucked or hauled pollutant discharge fee to cover the POTW's administrative expenses and any additional treatment, handling or inspection expenses incurred by the POTW in connection with the discharge. The fee shall be established, paid, and collected as provided for IPP fees by subdivision 21. This discharge fee shall be in addition to any sewer rates, fees, charges, or surcharges otherwise required by this division. 
(h)	Prior to accepting a proposed discharge of trucked or hauled pollutants, the POTW may be required to evaluate the capacity of the POTW to accept such wastes by means including, but not limited to, a headworks analysis or treatability study, as determined necessary by the POTW. All such evaluation and analysis shall be at the sole cost of the user proposing the discharge and shall be paid in full by the user whether or not the discharge of the trucked or hauled pollutants is ultimately approved by the POTW. The POTW may require the user to post a deposit or other form of surety, as determined sufficient and appropriate by the POTW, to ensure payment by the user of all such costs. 
(12)	Wastewater with objectionable color or light absorbency characteristics that may interfere with treatment processes or analytical determinations, including, without limitation, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions. 
(13)	Any garbage or other solid material that has not been properly shredded.
(14)	Solvent extractibles, including, without limitation, oil, grease, wax, or fat, whether emulsified or not, in excess of applicable local limits; or other substances that may solidify or become viscous (with a viscosity of one hundred ten (110) percent of water) at temperatures between 32º Fahrenheit and 150º Fahrenheit in amounts that may cause obstruction to the flow in sewers or other interference with the operation of the POTW. 
(15)	Soluble substances in a concentration that may increase the viscosity to greater than ten (10) percent over the viscosity of the water or in amounts that will cause obstruction to the flow in the POTW resulting in interference. 
(16)	Any substance which exerts or causes a high or unusual concentration of inert suspended solids, including, but not limited to, lime slurries, diatomaceous earth and lime residues. 
(17)	Any wastewater which contains suspended solids of such character, quantity or concentration that special attention is required, or additional expense incurred, to process such materials at the POTW. 
(18)	Any substance which exerts or causes a high or unusual concentration of dissolved solids, including, but not limited to, sodium chloride or sodium sulfate. 
(19)	Noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, fumes, or solids that either singly or by interaction with other wastes are sufficient to create a public nuisance, cause workplace conditions in violation of any applicable workplace health or safety standard, pose a hazard to life, sufficient to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance and repair, or cause any hazardous or unsafe conditions for the general public. 
(20)	Antifreeze, motor oil, brake fluid, transmission fluid, hydraulic fluid, cleaning solvents, oil-based paint, water-based paint with mercury biocides and paint thinners. 
(21)	Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of a half-life or concentration that may exceed limits established by applicable state or federal laws, rules or regulations. 
(22)	Any pollutant that results in excess foaming during the treatment process. Excess foaming is any foam that, in the opinion of the POTW superintendent, may interfere with the treatment process. 
(23)	Wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the POTW, or to exceed the limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. 
(24)	Any hazardous waste as defined by this division.
(25)	Any medical or infectious wastes, as defined by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality. 
(26)	Any substance that may cause the POTW's effluent or any other product of the POTW such as residues, sludges, or scums, to be unsuitable for reclamation, reuse or disposal, or otherwise interfere with the reclamation, reuse, or disposal process. In no case shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations developed under section 405 of the Act; under the Solid Waste Disposal Act (SWDA) (including title II, more commonly referred to as RCRA, and including state regulations contained in any state sludge management plan prepared pursuant to subtitle D of the SWDA); the Clean Air Act; the Toxic Substances Control Act; the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act; or any more stringent state or local regulations, as applicable. 
(27)	Any unpolluted water, noncontact cooling water, stormwater, surface water, groundwater, roof runoff or subsurface drainage (except to a storm sewer or a combined sewer as authorized by this division and other applicable local, state, and federal laws and regulations and subject to the prior approval of the POTW superintendent, and the MDEQ).

(37)	Waste not typically discharged to a sanitary sewer system unless specifically authorized by the POTW pursuant to policies and procedures established by the city and subject to limitations set forth in this division. 
(38)	Any mass, concentration or volume of a substance in excess of the amount allowed in the user's user permit. 
(39)	Any pollutant, substance, or wastewater that, either directly or indirectly, and either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, has a reasonable potential to: 
(a)	Create a chemical reaction with any materials of construction to impair the strength or durability of sewer structures; 
(b)	Cause a mechanical action that will damage or destroy sewer structures;
(c)	Impede or restrict the hydraulic capacity of the POTW;
(d)	Interfere with normal inspection or maintenance of sewer structures;
(e)	Place unusual demands upon the wastewater treatment equipment or processes by biological, chemical or physical means; or 
(f)	Cause a hazard to human life or create a public nuisance.
(C)	Pollutant reduction plans. If the POTW superintendent determines that a user has the reasonable potential to discharge any regulated pollutant (including, but not limited to, mercury or PCBs) to the POTW in quantities or magnitude that may cause interference or pass through; adversely impact the POTW, its processes or beneficial use of biosolids; cause noncompliance with applicable federal or state laws or regulations; cause the POTW to violate its NPDES permit, or otherwise fail to meet the purposes and objectives of this division, then the POTW superintendent may require the user to develop, submit for approval, and implement a reduction plan ("RP") for the pollutant, as provided by this section. The RP may be imposed as a condition to a user permit, or may be required independently and even if a user permit has not been issued to the user. 
(1)	At a minimum, the RP shall contain such requirements and conditions as determined necessary by the POTW superintendent to ensure that the pollutant reduction efforts will be effective in achieving the goals of this division (including, but not limited to, requirements and conditions regarding user source identification; best management practices; schedules of compliance; monitoring, sampling and analysis; reporting; treatment system for removal of the pollutant from the discharged wastewater; written procedures for disposal of contaminated wastes and wastewater; employee training and ongoing employee training requirements regarding pollutant related issues; elimination, if feasible, of any purchased materials containing the pollutant; and any other elements determined necessary and appropriate under the circumstances by the POTW superintendent). 
(2)	The goal of an RP shall be to maintain the amount of one or more pollutants or substances at or below the applicable discharge limits or levels, or such other goals as required by the POTW. The POTW superintendent may, in the POTW superintendent's discretion, consider cost effectiveness during the development and implementation of an RP. 
(3)	The POTW superintendent may require any user to submit an RP that describes the control strategy designed to proceed toward achievement of the specified goal and shall at a minimum include, but shall not be limited to, all of the following as determined necessary by the POTW superintendent on a case-by-case basis: 
(a)	Periodic monitoring for the pollutant in the user's discharge.
(b)	Periodic monitoring of the potential sources of the pollutant in the user's discharge.
c.	A commitment by the user that reasonable control measures and/or best management practices will be implemented when sources of the pollutant are discovered. Factors to be considered by the POTW may include the following:

(d)	An annual status report. The report shall be sent by the user to the POTW and shall include, at a minimum, all of the following: 
(i)	All RP monitoring results for the previous year.
(ii)	A list of potential sources of the pollutant in the user's discharge.
(iii)	A summary of all actions taken by the user to reduce or eliminate the identified sources of the pollutant or substance. 
(4)	As determined necessary by the POTW superintendent, the superintendent may require a user to develop, submit and implement an RP for any pollutant or substance regulated by this division. The POTW superintendent may also modify an approved RP at any time as determined necessary by the POTW superintendent to meet the goals and objectives of this division. 
(5)	Failure to submit an approvable RP within the specified deadlines or to fully and timely comply with any condition or requirement of an approved RP shall constitute a violation of this division, subject to the fine, penalty, and other enforcement provisions of this division. 
(6)	Holding enforcement action in abeyance. Except as provided for in subsections (C)(6)(c)(iv) and (vi), if the effluent sample analysis results of a user's discharge exceeds the applicable discharge limit, detection level, or quantification level for a pollutant, the POTW superintendent may, in the POTW superintendent's sole discretion, nevertheless allow that discharge to continue and may hold any enforcement action regarding the prohibited discharge in abeyance, subject to the terms, conditions, and requirements of this subsection (C)(6), as follows: 
(a)	If an approved RP is already in place: If effluent sample analysis results exceeds the applicable discharge limit, detection level, or quantification level for a pollutant for which an approved RP is already in place, then the POTW superintendent may, in the POTW superintendent's sole discretion, nevertheless allow that discharge to continue and may hold any enforcement action regarding the prohibited discharge in abeyance for the period that the sample represents if the RP (and all terms, conditions and requirements thereof) is being fully and continually performed in good faith by the user, as determined by the POTW superintendent, and subject to all of the requirements and conditions of subsection (C)(6)(c). 
(b)	If an approved RP is not already in place: If effluent sample analysis results exceeds the applicable discharge limit, detection level, or quantification level for a pollutant for which an approved RP is not already in place, then the POTW superintendent may, in the POTW superintendent's sole discretion, nevertheless allow that discharge to continue and may hold any enforcement regarding the prohibited discharge in abeyance, subject to all of the requirements and conditions of subsection (C)(6)(c), and provided further as follows: The user with the noncompliant discharge shall develop and implement an RP approved by the POTW superintendent to minimize the user's discharges of the pollutant in question to the POTW. The RP shall meet all of the requirements of this subsection (C). 
(c)	The following requirements and conditions shall apply to any situation under this subsection (C)(6) in which an enforcement action is held in abeyance as provided by this subsection (regardless of whether or not an RP was in place at the time of the non-compliance): 
(i)	The user with the noncompliant discharge shall have a POTW-accessible point for monitoring all discharges from the user to the POTW, as approved by the POTW. All costs and expenses for and related to the installation and maintenance of this monitoring point and any required sampling devices shall be paid for solely by the user. 
(ii)	The user with the noncompliant discharge shall routinely self-monitor its discharges to the POTW for the pollutant in question using the sampling methods, procedures, preservation and handling, and analytical protocol required by the POTW superintendent and at the frequency specified by the POTW superintendent. All costs and expenses of this sampling and analysis shall be paid for solely by the user. 
(iii)	The POTW may collect any additional samples of the user's discharge as determined necessary by the POTW superintendent, all costs and expenses to be paid for by the user. 
(iv)	If the user complies with all of the requirements and conditions for the RP as specified by the POTW superintendent; and if the POTW superintendent determines that all reasonable and cost-effective actions based on the economic, technical, and treatability considerations, including, but not limited to, all elements of the user's RP, have been, and continue to be, fully and satisfactorily implemented by the user; and if the user's discharge does not cause interference or pass through; adversely impact the POTW, its processes or beneficial use of biosolids; cause noncompliance with applicable federal or state laws or regulations; cause the POTW to violate its NPDES permit, or otherwise fail to meet the purposes and objectives of this division, then the POTW may, in its discretion, hold enforcement action in abeyance and allow the User to continue the noncompliant discharge. 
(v)	Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection (C)(6) to the contrary, and regardless of whether a user fully complies with all requirements and conditions of this section and/or of an approved RP, the POTW superintendent shall have the unconditional right to prohibit and terminate any noncompliant discharge at any time and without prior notice, and to take any enforcement action in response thereto, including any enforcement action that had previously been held in abeyance under this subsection (C)(6). 
(vi)	Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection (C)(6) to the contrary, the POTW superintendent shall not hold an enforcement action in abeyance as provided by this subsection for any pollutant parameter other than mercury and PCBs unless the POTW superintendent has first obtained approval from the MDEQ to implement the requirements of this subsection (C)(6) for the specific pollutant parameter in question. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 2(6.1), 7-25-11)
Sec. 29-150. - Pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(A)	Compliance with applicable standards and requirements. The National Categorical Pretreatment Standards as established for specific industries under 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N are hereby made a part of the requirements of this division in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations, and are incorporated by reference as if fully set forth in this division. A user shall comply with all categorical pretreatment standards and any other pretreatment requirements established under the Act that are applicable to that user. A user shall also comply with all other applicable pretreatment standards and requirements established under this division or under state and federal laws and regulations. 
(B)	Deadlines for compliance. Compliance by existing sources with categorical pretreatment standards shall be within three (3) years of the date the standard is effective unless a shorter compliance time is specified by 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter N. Existing sources that become industrial users subsequent to promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard shall be considered existing industrial users except where such sources meet the definition of "new source." New sources shall install and have in operating condition, and shall start up all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards and requirements before beginning to discharge. Within the shortest feasible time (not to exceed ninety (90) days), new sources must meet all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(C)	Alternative categorical limits. Categorical pretreatment standards shall apply to a user subject to categorical standards, unless an enforceable alternative limit to the corresponding national categorical standards is derived using any of the methods specified in MAC R 323.2313 (regarding removal credits, fundamentally different factor variances, net/gross calculations, equivalent mass per day limitations, and combined wastestream formula alternative limitations). The use of any alternative categorical limit shall be subject to the prior approval of the POTW superintendent. If local limits are more stringent than derived alternative categorical limits, the local limits shall control. 
(D)	Compliance with other applicable laws and regulations. Users of the POTW shall comply with all local, state and federal laws and regulations that may apply to their discharges to the POTW, including, but not limited to, article II, Air Pollution Control, part 55 of Act 451 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1994 (the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act). 
(Ord. No. 423, § 2(6.2), 7-25-11)
Sec. 29-151. - Right of revision. 
    The POTW reserves the right to establish more restrictive prohibitions, limitations and requirements for discharges to the POTW to prevent interference or pass through, to protect the POTW, to comply with applicable federal or state laws or regulations, to comply with the POTW's NPDES permit, or as otherwise determined necessary by the POTW superintendent. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 2(6.3), 7-25-11)
Sec. 29-152. - POTW's right to refuse or condition discharge. 
    The POTW may refuse to accept, or may condition its acceptance of, all or any portion of any proposed or existing discharge to the POTW from any person, regardless of whether or not a user permit has been issued for the discharge, if the POTW superintendent determines that the discharge has a reasonable potential to: adversely affect the operation of the POTW; result in pass through or interference; violate any pretreatment standard or requirement; cause the POTW to violate its NPDES permit; or if the impacts of the discharge on the POTW or the POTW's discharge are uncertain or unknown (because, for example, no local limits or headworks analysis has been conducted for particular pollutants in the discharge). If the POTW superintendent denies any person permission to commence or continue all or any portion of a discharge to the POTW, the person shall refrain from commencing to discharge or shall immediately terminate the discharge to the POTW and shall not thereafter recommence discharge without written authorization from the POTW superintendent. Similarly, if the POTW superintendent denies any person permission to commence or continue all or any portion of a discharge to the POTW except subject to conditions determined necessary and appropriate by the POTW superintendent, the person shall refrain from commencing or continuing the discharge except in full compliance with those conditions. This includes, but is not limited to, the POTW's right to revise or revoke user permits. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 2(6.4), 7-25-11)
Sec. 29-153. - Most restrictive standards and requirements apply. 
    Notwithstanding any provision of this division to the contrary, the most stringent or restrictive standard or requirement applicable to a user's discharge shall control, whether established by this division, by any notice, order, permit, decision or determination promulgated, issued or made by the POTW under this division, by state laws or regulations, including the POTW's NPDES permit, or by federal laws or regulations. Further, if state or federal laws or regulations provide for standards and requirements not covered by this division that are otherwise applicable to a user's discharge, those standards and requirements shall apply to the user in addition to those required by this division, and the most restrictive of those additional standards or requirements shall control and shall be complied with by the user within the time period required by the law or regulation. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 2(6.5), 7-25-11)
Sec. 29-154. - Dilution prohibited as substitute for treatment. 
    Unless expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement and subject to the prior approval of the POTW superintendent, no user shall ever increase the use of process water, mix separate wastestreams, or in any other way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a federal, state or local standard, requirement or limitation. The POTW may impose mass limitations on nondomestic users that are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements and in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. No user intending to use dilution as a substitute for treatment shall do so without the prior approval of the POTW superintendent consistent with the requirements of this section. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 2(6.6), 7-25-11)
Subdivision 7. - User Permits 

Sec. 29-155. - User permit required. 
(A)	Industrial user permits. It is unlawful and prohibited for any significant industrial user (SIU), or any other user as determined necessary by the POTW superintendent to carry out the purposes of this division, to discharge to the POTW without an industrial user permit as provided by this subdivision. 
(B)	General user permits. The POTW superintendent may require any user other than an SIU to obtain a general user permit to discharge to the POTW, subject to such terms and conditions as are determined necessary and appropriate by the POTW to achieve the purposes, policies and objectives of this division. 
(1)	A general user permit may contain, but shall not be required to contain, any of the terms and conditions that would apply to an industrial user permit issued to an SIU as provided by this subdivision to comply with the general and specific discharge prohibitions of this division, including, but not limited to, discharge limitations, and requirements regarding sampling and monitoring; pretreatment; pollution prevention, minimization or reductions plans; accidental discharge, spill prevention, and containment requirements; flow equalization; and implementation of best management practices or a best management practices plan. 
(2)	To the extent determined appropriate by the POTW superintendent on a case-by case basis, a general user permit issued under this subsection shall be subject to provisions otherwise applicable to permits for SIUs. However, all general user permits shall be nontransferable, and are subject to the permit fee and permit appeals provisions of this division. 
(3)	It is unlawful and prohibited for any user required by the POTW superintendent to obtain a general user permit to discharge to the POTW without a general user permit as provided by this subdivision. 
(4)	Failure to comply with a general user permit issued under this subsection constitutes a violation of this division. 
(5)	In no case shall a general user permit be construed to authorize the illegal discharge or otherwise excuse a violation of this division. 
(C)	[Violations.] Any violation of the terms or conditions of a user permit is a violation of this division, subject to the fine, penalty, and other enforcement provisions of this division. Obtaining a user permit shall not relieve a user of its obligation to obtain other permits or approvals that may be required by other local, state or federal laws or regulations. 
(D)	[Limitations of permit.] The issuance of a user permit shall not convey to a user any property rights or privilege of any kind whatsoever, nor shall it be construed to authorize any injury to private or public property or any invasion of personal rights, nor any violation of local, state or federal laws or regulations. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 2(7.1), 7-25-11)
Sec. 290-156. - Determination of user status. 
(A)	The POTW may require any user to submit information to the POTW for its use in determining whether the user's status, including, but not limited to, whether the user is an SIU, as well as to determine changes or the absence or inadequacy of changes in a user's facilities. 
(B)	The POTW shall notify a nondomestic user of the POTW's belief that the user is, or may be, an SIU. Upon such notification, the user must complete and submit an application for an industrial user permit on a form furnished by the POTW. The failure of the POTW to so notify a nondomestic user shall not relieve any SIU of the duty to obtain a permit as required by this division. 
(C)	Upon determination that a user permit is required, no connection to the POTW shall be made and no discharge thereto shall occur until a permit is duly issued; provided, however, that the POTW may at its discretion issue a written authorization in place of a permit, which authorization shall be valid for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 2(7.2), 7-25-11)
Sec. 29-157. - Permit application deadlines. 
    Each user must file an application for a user permit on the form provided by the POTW within the following deadlines: 
(A)	Existing SIUs. Any SIU discharging into the POTW as of the effective date of this division shall submit a completed permit application form to the POTW as provided by this subdivision within sixty (60) days of being so directed and provided a form by the POTW. 
(B)	Proposed new SIUs. Any SIU proposing to commence (or recommence) discharging into the POTW after the effective date of this division shall, at least sixty (60) days prior to the anticipated date on which discharging will commence (or recommence), request a permit application form and submit the completed application to the POTW. 
(C)	Categorical users subject to new standard. A user which becomes subject to a new or revised national categorical pretreatment standard, and which has not previously submitted an application for a permit as required herein, shall apply to the POTW for an industrial user permit within ninety (90) days after the promulgation of the applicable national categorical pretreatment standard. The POTW may also initiate this action; however, the failure of the POTW so to do shall not relieve a user of its obligation to obtain a permit. 
(D)	Other users. Any other user directed by the POTW to complete and submit a user permit application shall do so within sixty (60) days of being so directed by the POTW and provided a form by the POTW. Any user not required to obtain a user permit for existing discharges must apply for and receive a user permit prior to changing the user's discharge in such a manner that the resulting discharge would require a user permit.

(A)	Industrial user permits shall be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed five (5) years, subject to modification, reissuance, suspension or revocation as provided by this subdivision. At the discretion of the POTW, an industrial user permit may be issued for a period less than five (5) years and may be stated to expire on a specific date. 
(B)	General user permits may be issued for any time period determined appropriate by the POTW superintendent, subject to modification, reissuance, suspension or revocation as provided by this subdivision. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 2(7.8), 7-25-11)
Sec. 29-163. - Permit reissuance. 
(A)	To apply for reissuance of an existing user permit, a user must submit a complete permit application to the POTW accompanied by payment of an application fee at least ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the user's existing permit (or at least one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the expiration of a five-year permit). The application shall be submitted in a form prescribed by the POTW. It shall be the responsibility of the user to make a timely application for reissuance. 
(B)	All user permits issued to a particular user are void upon the issuance of a new user permit to that user. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 2(7.9), 7-25-11)
Sec. 29-164. - Continuation of expired permits. 
    An expired user permit will continue to be effective until the permit is reissued only if: 
(a)	The user has submitted a complete permit application at least ninety (90) days prior to the expiration date of the user's existing permit (or at least one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the expiration date of a five-year permit); and 
(b)	The failure to reissue the permit, prior to expiration of the previous permit, is not due to any act or failure to act on the part of the user: 
provided, however, in no case may a permit continue for a period of more than five (5) years from the date of issuance. In all other cases, discharge to the POTW following expiration of a permit is unlawful. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 2(7.10), 7-25-11)
Sec. 29-165. - Permit suspension and revocation. 
    User permits may be suspended or permanently revoked by the POTW for any reason determined necessary by the POTW to assure compliance with the requirements of this division, the POTW's NPDES permit, or other applicable laws and regulations, including, without limitation, any of the following reasons: 
(A)	Falsifying self-monitoring reports.
(B)	Tampering with monitoring equipment.
(C)	Failure to allow timely and reasonable access to the permittee's premises and records by representatives of the POTW for purposes authorized by this division, including, without limitation, inspection or monitoring.

Within one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or one hundred eighty (180) days after the final administrative decision made upon a category determination submission under MAC R 323.2311(2) whichever is later, an existing nondomestic user subject to the categorical pretreatment standards and that currently discharges or is scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit a report to the POTW as required by MAC R 323.2310(2). At least ninety (90) days prior to commencement of discharge, new sources, and sources that become nondomestic users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard shall submit the reports to the POTW as required by MAC R 323.2310(2). Any changes to the information required to be submitted by a nondomestic user pursuant to MAC R 323.2310(2)(a) through (e) shall be submitted by the user to the POTW within sixty (60) days of when the user becomes aware of the change. 
(B)	Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standard or, in the case of a new source, following commencement of the discharge to the POTW, any nondomestic user subject to categorical pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit the reports to the POTW required by MAC R 323.2310(3). 
(C)	Periodic reports on continued compliance. Any nondomestic user subject to a categorical pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of the categorical pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the public sewer or POTW, shall submit the periodic reports to the POTW required by MAC R 323.2310(4). These periodic reports shall be submitted at least once every six (6) months (during the months of June and December unless alternate months are approved by the POTW), unless required more frequently by the applicable pretreatment standard, by the POTW, or by the state. The reports shall include a record of all average and maximum daily flows during the prior six-month reporting period, except that the POTW may require more detailed reporting of flows. All flows shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement unless the POTW agrees, due to cost or nonfeasibility, to accept verifiable estimates of the average and maximum flows estimated using techniques approved by the POTW. The combined wastestream formula may be used for reporting purposes after the initial information has been furnished to the POTW, provided there has been no change to the elements composing the combined wastestream. The results of sampling of the discharge and analysis of pollutants appearing in the report shall be cross-referenced to the related flow and mass to determine compliance with National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management practice (or pollution prevention alternative), the user shall submit documentation required by the POTW or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 2(8.1), 7-25-11)
Sec. 29-172. - Reports required for nondomestic users not subject to categorical pretreatment standards.

(Ord. No. 423, § 2(8.11), 7-25-11)
Subdivision 9. - Sampling, Analysis and Monitoring Requirements[3] 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note-This subdivision provides the sampling, analysis and monitoring requirements applicable to users of the POTW. It does not apply to domestic users except as may be determined appropriate in specific cases by the POTW. All users required by this division (or by any permit, order, decision or determination issued or made under this division) to sample, monitor and analyze their discharges to the POTW shall do so according to the minimum requirements provided by this subdivision. Additional or more restrictive sampling, analytical or monitoring requirements may be required for a particular user by a permit, order, decision or determination issued or made under this division.

Sec. 29-182. - Sampling and analytical techniques and procedures. 
    All sampling, measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of discharges to the POTW shall be performed in accordance with the procedures approved by the U.S. EPA contained in 40 CFR part 136. If, as determined by the POTW superintendent, the sampling and analytical techniques contained in 40 CFR part 136 are not available, do not apply to the discharge or pollutants in question, are not appropriate under the circumstances for application to the discharge or pollutants in question, or where one or more alternate techniques are available under 40 CFR part 136, sampling and analysis shall be performed using validated sampling and analytical methods and procedures approved or required by the POTW superintendent. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 2(9.1), 7-25-11)
Sec. 29-183. - Sampling frequency. 
    Users shall sample their discharges to the POTW at a frequency necessary to assess and assure compliance with the requirements of this division, any permit or order issued pursuant to this division, all applicable pretreatment standards and requirements, other applicable state and federal laws and regulations, or as otherwise determined necessary by the POTW superintendent consistent with the purposes and intent of this division. At a minimum, all significant industrial users shall sample their effluent two (2) times per year (once every six (6) months) or as often as provided by their permits, whichever is more frequent, and report the results to the POTW. Each discharge point to the POTW shall be sampled and reported individually. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 2(9.2), 7-25-11)
Sec. 29-184. - Sample types. 
(A)	Where representative samples are required to be taken for facilities for which historical sampling data does not exist, a user shall take a minimum of 4 grab samples for pH, temperature, cyanide, phenols (T), residual chlorine, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics (and any other parameters designated by the POTW superintendent), unless a greater number of grab samples is required in advance by the POTW superintendent; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the POTW may authorize a lower minimum number of grab samples. In all cases, users shall take the minimum number of grab samples determined necessary by the POTW to assess and assure compliance by users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. Grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous minimum or instantaneous maximum discharge limits. For all other pollutants and sampling, twenty-four-hour composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the POTW. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority, the samples must be representative of the discharge and the decision to allow the alternative sampling must be documented in the industrial user file for that facility or facilities. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: For cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the POTW, as appropriate. 
(B)	The POTW superintendent may require any user (categorical or noncategorical) to conduct continuous pH monitoring instead of using grab samples. A user required to conduct continuous monitoring will be subject to enforcement under subsection 29-228(H). 
(Ord. No. 423, § 2(9.3), 7-25-11)
Sec. 29-185. - Sampling methods, equipment and location. 
(A)	General. A user shall use the sampling methods, sampling equipment, and sampling location specified by the user's user permit, or, in the absence of a permit, as otherwise required by the POTW superintendent. 
(B)	Contaminated groundwater. For discharges to the POTW from remedial actions related to leaking underground storage tanks or other sources of contaminated groundwater, the POTW superintendent may require the following analyses or such other analyses as determined appropriate by the superintendent: 
(1)	Samples shall be analyzed for benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene and xylene using the latest methods approved by U.S. EPA. 
(2)	For total petroleum hydrocarbons, samples shall be analyzed according to the latest methods approved by U.S. EPA.

Sec. 29-191. - Required sampling structures and devices. 
(A)	The POTW may require any user to install suitable control structures (such as sampling manholes or sampling vaults) and necessary measuring and sampling devices (including automatic devices) to facilitate the observation, sampling, and measurement of the quantity, composition, and concentrations of discharges to the POTW. The POTW may require the user to install control structures and measuring and sampling devices at every discharge point and/or outfall. Further, multiple separate and discrete control structures, and measuring and sampling devices may be required for a single user, premises, building, facility or user, as determined necessary by the POTW superintendent. The structures and devices shall be maintained at all times in a safe, clean and proper operating condition at the sole expense of the user. All buildings of significant industrial users constructed after January 1, 1993, shall include monitoring facilities approved by the POTW superintendent at every outfall that may discharge nondomestic wastewater. 
(B)	There shall be ample room in or near the control structure to allow accurate monitoring, measuring, sampling and preparation of samples for analysis, as determined necessary by the POTW superintendent. At a minimum, all sewers shall have an inspection and sampling manhole or structure with an opening of no less than twenty-four (24) inches in diameter and an internal diameter of no less than thirty-six (36) inches containing flow measuring, recording and sampling equipment as required by the POTW superintendent to assure compliance with this division. 
(C)	Any temporary or permanent obstruction for safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the verbal or written request of the POTW. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user. 
(D)	The location and complexity of the required control structure or devices may vary with sampling requirements determined necessary by the POTW superintendent to protect the POTW and to comply with applicable laws and regulations. 
(E)	The required sampling structures and devices shall be constructed and installed at the user's sole expense in accordance with plans submitted to the POTW, and in compliance with all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Users shall submit to the POTW plans and specifications for construction or modification of monitoring facilities at least thirty (30) days before the proposed commencement of construction or modification. If a user constructs or modifies monitoring facilities before POTW approval or without an inspection during construction and the POTW determines that the monitoring facilities are not acceptable, then the user shall at its cost reconstruct or modify the monitoring facilities according to the requirements of the POTW. Construction shall be completed within ninety (90) days following written notification by the POTW, or within such other shorter or longer time period specified by the POTW superintendent as required by the particular circumstances to meet the requirements of this division. The structures and devices shall be operated and maintained by the user at the user's sole expense so as to be safe and accessible to POTW personnel at all times and so as to provide accurate and representative monitoring data. If a user fails to install or maintain a required structure or device, the POTW may do so and charge the costs to the user. 
(F)	The sampling structures and devices must be provided on the user's premises as approved by the POTW, but the POTW may, if it determines that such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship to the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. 
(G)	Samples shall be taken at a control structure approved by the POTW. However, in the absence of a suitable control structure as required by this section, samples shall be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if pretreatment facilities exist, or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment facilities exist. If other wastewaters are mixed with a regulated process wastestream prior to pretreatment, the user must measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula under MAC R 323.2311(7) or other methods required by the POTW to evaluate compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(H)	No user shall change monitoring points or monitoring methods without first notifying and receiving the approval of the POTW superintendent. The POTW superintendent shall not approve any change in a user's monitoring point or points that would allow the user to substitute dilution for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with applicable standards. 
(I)	A user shall allow the POTW access to all sampling and monitoring facilities as provided by subsection 29-220(B).

The POTW may reinstate the wastewater treatment service and terminate any judicial proceedings, as applicable, upon satisfactory proof or other demonstration by the user that the noncomplying discharge has been eliminated or will not reoccur. A detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the causes of the noncomplying discharge and the measures taken to prevent any further occurrence shall be submitted to the POTW superintendent within fifteen (15) days of the occurrence. 
(D)	Noncompliance due to factors beyond user's control. If noncompliance with an order is unintentional and temporary and due to factors beyond the reasonable control of a user, and the user can demonstrate the conditions necessary for demonstration of an upset as provided by subsection 29-201(A), the POTW superintendent may modify the order or take other actions as determined appropriate. However, a user shall not be relieved of liability for noncompliance with an order to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed or inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventative maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(E)	Amendment, suspension and revocation of orders. An order shall be subject to amendment, suspension or revocation as determined appropriate by the POTW superintendent. Notice of the amendment, suspension or revocation shall be served upon the user in the same manner as notice was provided for the original order. An amendment, suspension or revocation of an order shall be subject to the same procedures for review and appeal as the original issuance of the order, as provided by this division. 
(F)	Consent orders and agreements. The POTW superintendent may enter into a consent order or agreement with a user to resolve disputed claims and address identified and potential deficiencies in the user's compliance status. The order or agreement shall be in the form of a written agreement with the user and may contain appropriate provisions, including, without limitation, compliance schedules and stipulated fines and remedial actions. 
(G)	POTW authority to require financial assurances. The POTW may require any user to post a performance bond (or other form of surety acceptable to the POTW superintendent) sufficient to cover expenses (direct and/or indirect) that might reasonably be incurred by the POTW as a result of the user's discharges to the POTW (including, but not limited to, the costs to restore or repair any damage to the POTW) or sufficient to achieve consistent compliance with applicable laws and regulations, as determined necessary by the POTW superintendent. Further, any user that has in the prior two (2) years been responsible for causing interference or pass through at the POTW may be required to obtain liability insurance sufficient to cover the reasonable costs of responding or restoring the POTW in the event of a second such incident. These financial assurance requirements may also be made conditions of a user permit.

(1)	The fine for any offense that is a first repeat offense shall be not less than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00), plus costs. 
(2)	The fine for any offense that is a second repeat offense or any subsequent repeat offense shall be not less than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), plus costs. 
(C)	Amount of fines. Subject to the minimum fine amounts specified in subsections (A) and (B), the following factors shall be considered by the court in determining the amount of a municipal civil infraction fine following the issuance of a municipal civil infraction citation for a violation of this division: the type, nature, severity, frequency, duration, preventability, potential and actual effect, and economic benefit to the violator (such as delayed or avoided costs or competitive advantage) of a violation; the violator's recalcitrance or efforts to comply; the economic impacts of the fine on the violator; and such other matters as justice may require. A violator shall bear the burden of demonstrating the presence and degree of any mitigating factors to be considered in determining the amount of a fine. However, mitigating factors shall not be considered unless it is determined that the violator has made all good faith efforts to correct and terminate all violations. 
(D)	Authorized local official. Notwithstanding any other provision of the city's laws, ordinances and regulations to the contrary, the following persons are designated as the authorized local officials to issue municipal civil infraction citations directing alleged violators to appear in district court for violations of this division (or, if applicable, to issue municipal civil infraction notices directing alleged violators to appear at a municipal ordinance violations bureau): the POTW superintendent, the building official, any sworn law enforcement officer, and any other persons so designated by the city.

Sec. 29-226. - Criminal penalties; imprisonment. 
    Any person who: 
(1)	At the time of a violation knew or should have known that a pollutant or substance was discharged contrary to any provision of this division, or contrary to any notice, order, permit, decision or determination promulgated, issued or made by the POTW under this division; or 
(2)	Intentionally makes a false statement, representation, or certification in an application for, or form pertaining to a permit, or in a notice, report, or record required by this division, or in any other correspondence or communication, written or oral, with the POTW regarding matters regulated by this division; or 
(3)	Intentionally falsifies, tampers with, or renders inaccurate any sampling or monitoring device or record required to be maintained by this division; or 
(4)	Commits any other act that is punishable under state law by imprisonment for more than ninety (90) days; 
shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per violation, per day, or imprisonment for up to ninety (90) days, or both in the discretion of the court. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 2(17.7), 7-25-11)
Sec. 29-227. - Continuing violation. 
    Each act of violation, and each day or portion of a day that a violation of this division (or of any permit, order, notice or agreement issued or entered into under this division) exists or occurs, constitutes a separate violation subject to the fines, penalties and other sanctions and remedies as provided by this division. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 2(17.8), 7-25-11)
Sec. 29-228. - Number of violations. 
    The number of violations resulting from a user's noncompliance with applicable discharge prohibitions or effluent limitations shall be determined as follows: 
(A)	Applicable concentration limitations and mass (or loading) limitations shall be treated as separate limitations, and a user may be liable and penalized separately for exceeding any of those limitations for a single pollutant or sampling parameter. 
(B)	Each violation of a daily maximum limit for a single pollutant or sampling parameter shall constitute a separate violation for each day on which the violation occurs or continues. 
(C)	Each violation of an instantaneous minimum or instantaneous maximum limit for a single pollutant or sampling parameter shall constitute a separate violation for each such occurrence, and there may be multiple violations for each day on which such a violation occurs or continues. 
(D)	Each violation of a monthly average limit (or of some other average limit period) for a single pollutant or sampling parameter shall constitute a separate violation for each day of the month (or other stated period) during which the violation occurred, regardless of the number of days on which samples were actually taken. (For example, in a month with thirty-one (31) days, a violation of the monthly average limit for that month constitutes thirty-one (31) violations for each pollutant parameter for which the monthly average limit was exceeded during the month.) 
(E)	Except with regard to violations of average limits as provided by subsection (D), a violation will be deemed to have continued to occur each day beginning with the first day the violation occurred to the day the user is able to demonstrate through appropriate sampling results that the violation is no longer occurring. 
(F)	If for any period a user has violated both a daily maximum limit and an average limit for a particular pollutant parameter, then the total number of violations is the sum of the days on which the daily maximum limit was violated plus the number of days in the averaging period. 
(G)	If a user permit regulates more than one outfall, each outfall shall be considered separately in computing the number of violations as provided by this section. 
(H)	If a user is discharging a wastestream that is required to be monitored and analyzed under continuous monitoring procedures (such as for pH or any other parameter that is required to be monitored and analyzed under continuous monitoring) then all of the following shall apply: 
(1)	If at any time during a daily twenty-four-hour period the continuous monitoring shows that the monitored parameter exceeded the instantaneous minimum, instantaneous maximum, or daily maximum limit for that parameter, then a violation has occurred. 
(2)	If during a daily twenty-four-hour period under continuous monitoring the monitored parameter exceeds the instantaneous minimum, instantaneous maximum, or daily maximum limit more than once after returning to compliance during that period, then each such exceedance shall be considered a separate violation. 
(3)	If during a daily twenty-four-hour period under continuous monitoring the monitored parameter exceeds the instantaneous minimum, instantaneous maximum, or daily limit into the next daily twenty-four-hour period (i.e., the exceedance occurs both before and after midnight), then the exceedance will be considered a separate violation on both days. 
(4)	If during a daily twenty-four-hour period under continuous monitoring the monitored parameter exceeds instantaneous minimum, instantaneous maximum, or the daily limit for more than sixty-six (66) percent of the twenty-four-hour [period], as determined in minutes of the day, then the user will be considered to be in significant noncompliance. 
(I)	One violation occurs on: each day that a report is late; and each day after an action required to be completed is not completed. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 2(17.9), 7-25-11)
Sec. 29-229. - Nuisance.

(3)	The composition of the discharge.
(4)	The nature, extent, and degree of success the POTW may achieve in minimizing or mitigating the effect of the discharge. 
(5)	The toxicity, degradability, treatability and dispersal characteristics of the discharges.
(6)	The direct and indirect costs incurred by the POTW, or imposed upon the POTW to treat the discharges, including sludge handling and disposal costs. 
(7)	Fines, assessments, levies, charges, expenses and penalties imposed upon and/or incurred by the POTW, including the POTW's costs of defense of actions, or suits brought or threatened against the POTW by governmental agencies or third parties. 
(8)	Such other factors, including the amount of any attorney's fees, consultant and expert fees, expenses, costs, sampling and analytical fees, repairs, etc., as the POTW deems appropriate under the circumstances.

If severed or suspended, the sewer and/or water service shall recommence only after the user has satisfactorily demonstrated to the city the user's ability to comply with all applicable provisions of this division, and only at the user's sole expense. 
(Ord. No. 423, § 2(17.13), 7-25-11)
Sec. 29-233. - Judicial relief. 
    With the approval of the city, in conjunction with the city's legal counsel, the POTW superintendent may institute legal proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to seek all appropriate relief for violations of this division or of any permit, order, notice or agreement issued or entered into under this division. The action may seek temporary or permanent injunctive relief, damages, penalties, costs, and any other relief, at law or equity, that a court may order.

ARTICLE IV. - ELECTRICITY FRANCHISE 
DIVISION 1. - DTE ENERGY 

Sec. 29-300. - Purpose and scope. 
    This division constitutes the grant of a franchise from the City of Allegan (the "city") to DTE Energy Marketing, Inc., a Michigan corporation (the "grantee"), to market and supply electricity through and over existing and future electrical lines owned and operated by another authorized public utility and to conduct a local electric business as an electric power marketer and third-party supplier in the city. The grant of a franchise is required because, among other reasons, Article VII, Section 29 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 provides that a public utility may not use the streets, highways or other public rights-of-way within the city for public utility facilities or otherwise transact business without first obtaining a franchise. 
(Ord. No. 351, § 1, 6-12-00)
Sec. 29-301. - Term. 
    The city grants the right, power and authority to the grantee to market and commercially use existing and future electric lines consisting of towers, masts, poles, crossarms, guys, braces, feeders, transmission and distribution wires, transformers and other electrical facilities for the purpose of supplying, transmitting, transforming and distributing electricity and conducting a local electric business (the "electrical system") on, under, along and across the highways, streets, alleys, bridges, waterways, and other public places (referred to collectively as "public rights-of-way") in the city for a period of thirty (30) years. 
(Ord. No. 351, § 1, 6-12-00)

(Ord. No. 351, § 1, 6-12-00)
Sec. 29-303. - Right-of-way fee. 
    If grantee or any subsidiary of grantee pays a franchise fee, charge, or other payment of any kind or nature on a periodic basis to any municipality in Michigan, then the grantee shall pay to the city a fee computed in the same manner as the fee is computed in the other municipality. Grantee will provide the city with an annual report by January 1 of each year detailing and reporting on such fee arrangements with, and payments to, other municipalities in Michigan. A one-time charge prior to and for the installation of new service shall not be considered a periodic fee unless the charge is unreasonably higher than that paid to other municipalities. If fees are paid by the grantee to more than one (1) municipality, then the computation of the fee for the city shall be based upon the method producing the largest fee. The city shall have the right, at its cost, to audit the books and records or review audits of the books and records of the grantee to determine whether and to what extent a fee is due. Any additional fee found due as a result of the audit or review shall be paid by the grantee to the city. If the additional fee is greater than two (2) percent of the total fee which should have been paid for any calendar year, the grantee shall pay the city's costs for the audit.

(1)	For trees lost by age, disease or acts of nature, trees shall be replaced as soon as possible and by a plan recommended yearly by the commission. Normally a tree killed by storm or disease damage will be replaced by a one-and-one-half-inch or two-inch tree. The cost will be shared by the property owner on a fifty-fifty basis. 
(2)	Where a tree is lost by negligent or intentional damage or vandalism, the person, vehicle owner, or agent responsible shall be charged for the value of an equal sized replacement. If such a replacement is not available locally, the value of the tree will be computed from the state forestry and park association shade tree evaluation formula and the person shall be invoiced that amount to compensate for costs of removal and planting of a replacement. 
(3)	Each year, in addition to the list of trees drawn up by the commission, property owners may request (at times to be designated by the commission) to have trees replaced that may have been removed prior to March 11, 1985. When possible the city will replace these trees on a fifty-fifty cost-sharing arrangement. If the trees requested are totally on private property, the property owner shall bear the entire cost of the replacement tree. The council shall budget funds adequate to complete these objectives after it approves the commission's annual proposal.

402.2 Unclassified Uses
The Planning Commission may find that a land use, while not specifically classified in this ordinance as a permitted or special land use, may be sufficiently similar to uses listed as permitted by right or as special uses. In that event, such unclassified uses may be reviewed and treated as similar classified uses within the district. In reaching such a finding, the Zoning Administrator shall first evaluate the proposed use in terms of the potential generation of traffic, congestion, noise, odors, dust, litter and similar impacts. In addition,
IV-7
City of Allegan
Zoning Ordinance
Article IV  Use and
Dimensional Standards
the proposed use shall be evaluated to determine the degree to which it may support or conflict with the intent of the district and other permitted and special land uses. If the Zoning Administrator determines that such use is similar to the uses permitted by special use permit, a report outlining the determination shall be provided to the Planning Commission with a recommendation to consider such use as sufficiently similar to permitted or special land uses within the district and the approval standards that should be used to evaluate the proposed use. Where a proposed use of land or use of building is not contemplated or specified by this Ordinance or where the Zoning Administrator has a question as to the appropriateness of a use, which, although permitted, involves other features, which were not contemplated or specified by this Ordinance, the Zoning Administrator shall request a determination by the Planning Commission. If the Planning Commission determines that such use is not contemplated or specified by this Ordinance, or that it involves features, which were not contemplated or specified herein, such use shall be prohibited. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a future amendment of this ordinance to provide standards to regulate a land use that may be currently excluded.
402.3 BULK STANDARDS TABLE

Article VIII
R-4, Mobile Home Residential District
800 District intent
This district is intended to provide for the location and regulation of manufactured housing communities. It is intended that manufactured housing communities be provided with necessary community services in a setting that provides a high quality of life for residents and residential development standards consistent with all other residential districts in the City of Allegan. This use shall be located in areas where it will be compatible with adjacent land uses. Determining the appropriate location for a manufactured housing community is a uniquely challenging task and may have a crucial impact on adjacent and surrounding land uses. A manufactured housing community contains specific site conditions unlike other types of residential development. Sites with an abundance of natural features such as forested areas, wetlands, and steep slopes and sites without the road and utility infrastructure to support a high density living environment are not found to be suitable for the development of a manufactured housing community.
Within the R4 District, manufactured housing communities shall be governed by this Section, by the requirements of the Act 96 of the Public Acts of 1987, as amended and the standards set forth in the Rules and Regulations promulgated by the Manufactured Housing Commission, including Part 9, Community Construction. The intent of this Section is to provide for manufactured home development, of longterm duration of stay, in areas which are developed in a manner which takes into account such special characteristics as locational needs, site layout and design, demand upon community services, and the relationship to and effect upon surrounding uses of land, and conformance to the City of Allegan Master Plan. All manufactured home developments shall comply with the applicable requirements of Public Act 96 of 1987, as amended. The controlling standards in this Section are not designed to generally exclude mobile homes of persons who engage in any aspect pertaining to the business of mobile homes or mobile home parks.
801 Application procedures
Pursuant to Section 11 of Act 96 of the Public Acts of 1987, as amended, and the rules promulgated thereunder, an application for the extension, alteration, or construction of a manufactured home development shall be accompanied by a preliminary plan of the proposed development and all permanent buildings indicating the proposed methods of
VIII-2
City of Allegan
Zoning Ordinance
Article VIII  R-4
compliance with these requirements. Said application, fees and preliminary plan shall meet the following requirements:
An application form shall be completed and fees paid in accordance with the fee schedule (as amended from time to time by resolution of the City Council) and twelve (12) copies of the preliminary plan shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator for distribution to the Planning Commission.
The preliminary plan need not include detailed construction plans, but shall include the following materials:
The applicant's name, address and telephone number and the property owner's name, address and telephone number, if different than that of the applicant.
Notation of all federal, state and local permits required.
The location of the project including the permanent parcel number(s) of the property upon which the project is proposed to be located.
The layout of the project including an illustration of the internal roadway system proposed and typical homesite layout.
The general design of the proposed project including the proposed location and design of signs, trash receptacles, light fixtures and any accessory structures, open lands and recreation areas and accessory uses.
The location, spacing, type and size of proposed plant materials.
A general description of the proposed project including the number of homesites proposed, the anticipated phasing of project development and an indication of the number of homesites to be rented and the number to be sold, if any.
802 Review process
The Planning Commission shall review the submitted preliminary plan and render a decision to approve, approve with conditions or deny the preliminary plan. The Planning Commission shall approve the preliminary plan upon a finding that the proposed use will not, upon the facts known at the time of the submission of the site plan, cause undue hardship, or create unsafe or hazardous health or safety conditions to the general public. Not more than sixty (60) days following the receipt by the Zoning Administrator of a complete application for preliminary plan approval, the Planning Commission shall approve, approve with conditions or modifications, or deny an application and preliminary plan pursuant to the Mobile Home Commission Act, the rules promulgated thereunder and this ordinance.
Upon approval of the preliminary plan, the Zoning Administrator shall sign three (3) copies thereof. One (1) signed copy shall be made a part of the Citys files, one (1) copy shall be retained by the Zoning Administrator, and one (1) copy shall be returned to the applicant. Construction shall commence within five (5) years after the date of issuance of a
Zoning Ordinance
construction permit by the Michigan Department of Consumer and Industry Services unless an extension has been granted by said Department. Amendments to the approved preliminary plan must be submitted to the Planning Commission for review and approval.
803 Noncompliance
Any substantial noncompliance with the approved preliminary plan shall be reported to the Manufactured Housing Division of the Department of Consumer and Industry Services for remedy along with all pertaining evidence.
804 Site development requirements
The site development requirements of the Manufactured Housing Commission, together with any other applicable requirements of the State of Michigan, Act 96 of 1987, as amended, shall be complied with. No manufactured housing community shall be maintained, operated, or conducted without an annual license from the Michigan Department of Consumer and Industry Services. An inspection of construction may be performed at any appropriate time, pursuant to 1987 PA 96, as amended (the Mobile Home Commission Act).
805 Site size
The minimum site size for a manufactured housing community shall be fifteen (15) acres.

C-1, Central Business District
900 Intent
This district is intended to reflect the central part of the city where downtown shopping, government offices, general services, civic and cultural uses are located.

1703 Home occupations
It is the policy of the City of Allegan to encourage entrepreneurship and a reasonable, nonintrusive degree of activity within residential areas during normal business hours. Such activity contributes to the vitality of the community, economy and increases safety within neighborhoods. However, excessive commercial activity, such as traffic, odors, deliveries and signage, within a neighborhood may undermine its residential character. The intent of this section is to establish reasonable standards to regulate home occupation activities that are compatible with the residential character of a neighborhood.
A. Minor home occupation: A minorhome occupation is a home occupation as defined herein, which would normally not be apparent to neighbors living in the vicinity, such as providing piano lessons to one student at a time. A minor home occupation shall be permitted in any residential district, subject to the following conditions. Minor home occupations:
1. Must be registered with the Zoning Administrator. Registration shall be provided on forms developed by the City and may require a fee as determined by the City Council. Such registration shall document that the minor home occupation shall be conducted in accordance with the terms of this section.
2. Must be conducted entirely within a residential building or within an accessory structure, and must not be evident in any way from the street or from any neighboring premises.
3. Must not change the character of the building in which it is conducted and must not constitute, create or increase a nuisance.

Furthermore, the home occupation shall not create an electrical interference with the transmission of television, cellular, wireless service, or radio in the area which exceeds that which is normally produced by a residential dwelling unit in the district.
7. Must provide sufficient solid waste receptacles sufficiently screened and maintain the property free of debris.
8. Must not devote more than twentyfive (25) percent of the principal building to such home occupation, and an accessory building shall not be used for a minor home occupation

1707.29 SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESS
A. Intent and purpose. The purpose and intent of this section of this Ordinance pertaining to the regulation of sexually oriented businesses is to regulate the location and operation of, but not to exclude, sexually oriented businesses within the City and to minimize their negative secondary effects. It is recognized that sexually oriented businesses, because of their very nature, have serious objectionable operational characteristics, which cause negative secondary effects upon nearby residential, educational, religious, and other similar public and private uses. The regulation of sexually oriented businesses is necessary to ensure that their negative secondary effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of surrounding areas and will not negatively impact the health, safety and general welfare of City residents or visitors. Further, it is necessary to ensure proper placement of such uses to protect those in the City under the age of 18; and therefore, these regulations are intended to restrict sexually oriented businesses to locations where youth are least likely to encounter them accidentally, particularly when walking. The provisions of this Ordinance are not intended to offend the guarantees of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or to deny adults access to sexually oriented businesses and their products, or to deny sexually oriented businesses access to their intended market. Neither is it the intent of this Ordinance to legitimize activities that are prohibited by the Ordinances of the City, or state or federal law. If any portion of this Section, or the definitions pertaining to this Section, is found to be invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the City intends that said portion be disregarded, reduced and/or revised so as to be recognized to the fullest extent possible by law.
