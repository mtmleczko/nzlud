PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Suwanee, Georgia. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances subsequently adopted by the Mayor and City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    This 2008 republication includes all amendatory legislation through ordinances adopted in December 2007, and was accomplished under the supervision of Lennon Akins, Editor. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Ronald K. McLaughlin, Code Attorney, and Leesa Hampton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Gregory D. Jay, City Attorney, Hardin Watkins, City Manager, and Lisa Pendley, City Clerk for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Whereas, the City Council of the City of Suwanee has previously adopted that certain "Code of Ordinances, City of Suwanee, Georgia" codifying its ordinances into a unified, bound Code for the public's use; 
Whereas, the City desires to replace said Code with a new bound edition that incorporates existing ordinances and new ordinances adopted since [May 15, 2001] in one single, unified volume; 
Now Therefore, Be it Ordained and Resolved by the authority of the City Council of the City of Suwanee, a Georgia Municipal Corporation, and it is Hereby Ordained and Resolved as Follows:

    Section 2. All ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted on or before [May 15, 2001], and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein, are repealed. 
    Section 3. The repeal provided for in section 2 hereof shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance that is repealed by this ordinance.

Unless another penalty is expressly provided, every person convicted of a violation of any provision of the Code or any ordinance, rule or regulation adopted or issued in pursuance thereof shall be punished by a fine of $1,000.00, imprisonment not exceeding six months or by both such fine and imprisonment. Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly provided, shall apply to the amendment of any Code section, whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the city may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits. 
    Section 5. Additions or amendments to the Code when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the City Council to make the same a part of the Code shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments. 
    Section 6. Ordinances adopted after April 22, 2008 that amend or refer to ordinances that have been codified in the Code shall be construed as if they amend or refer to like provision of the Code.

Editor's note- Printed in this Article I is the Charter of the city, as adopted by 1999 Ga. Laws, page 3729. Amendments to the Charter are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended sections. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original act.

(b)  An ordinance may be introduced by any councilmember and be read at a regular or special meeting of the city council. Ordinances shall be considered and adopted or rejected by the city council in accordance with the rules which it shall establish; provided, however, an ordinance may be adopted the same day it is introduced.

Editor's note- Ord. of 9-18-2001, adopted Sept. 18, 2001, amended article II in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former article II, §§ 10-31-10-131, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 1059, §§ 1-32, 6-15-1993. 

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 10-31. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to regulate certain types of businesses including, but not limited to, adult entertainment establishments, to the end that the many types of criminal activities frequently engendered by such businesses will be curtailed; however, it is recognized that such regulation cannot de facto approach prohibition, otherwise, a protected form of expression would vanish. As to adult dance establishments, this article represents a balancing of competing interests, reduced criminal activity and protection of the neighborhoods through the regulation of adult entertainment establishments versus the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and patrons. 
    The City of Suwanee finds that the regulation of the location of certain adult establishments is necessary to promote and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare of the city as said establishments would not be appropriate in certain zoning classifications and adjacent to or near certain institutions. The city takes official notice of certain studies which have illustrated harmful secondary negative effects of adult establishments/sexually oriented businesses including increased crime, decreased property values, and increased blight. The city takes notice of and incorporates herein by reference as if fully set forth herein those certain studies and findings along with the public hearing of the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners on July 17, 2001. Said hearing consisted of inter alia of testimony from law enforcement personnel and economic development experts. 
    The city incorporates herein by reference the National Law Center for Children and Families Study of thirty-two (32) communities in the United States of America and incorporates each study as if fully set forth herein. 
    The city also recognizes the right of speech grounded in the Georgia and U.S. Constitution and the manifestation of such through adult/sexually oriented businesses and the products and services they render. In seeking to protect this right the city finds the regulations set forth herein are the least restrictive means available in balancing this right while furthering the substantial governmental interests set forth above.

Sec. 22-60. - Financial qualifications. 
(a)  Applicants seeking a certificate of authority to act as professional bonding entities in the city must qualify under one of the following provisions: 
(1)  Real property. Applicants requesting permission to sign professional bail bonds by pledging their real property as collateral must do so in agreement with the chief of police. Such individual or entity must execute a deed to secure debt in favor of the chief of police to unencumbered real property within the county. Such deed shall be conditioned to allow the chief or his authorized agent to foreclose upon the default of the applicant by failure to pay any bond forfeiture judgment, subsequent to revocation of the certificate of authority, and subsequent to the depletion of any escrow account established in agreement with the chief of police for payment of such judgments. Such real property will be appraised by a qualified appraiser agreeable to the chief of police and the applicant will maintain title insurance in force on such property. Bondsmen may write bonds against the pledged property not to exceed one-half the unencumbered value of the property excluding homestead exemption on each parcel of property pledged. Bondsmen coming under this plan must comply with the same requirements placed on individuals signing property bonds. 
(2)  Escrow accounts. Applicants may sign an agreement with the chief of police providing for an escrow account in a federally insured savings and loan or commercial bank located within the county. The escrow agent shall be authorized to pay the chief of police the sum of any unsatisfied fi fa presented to the escrow agent by the chief of police or his authorized agent, subsequent to entry of the judgment on the general execution docket of the county and subsequent to 30 days from the date of mailing to the individual authorized to receive process for the bonding entity. This escrow shall be ten percent of the company's bonding capacity and shall not be less than $20,000.00. Any interest generated by such an account must revert to the applicant since the chief of police or the city is not authorized under state law to receive such interest. Escrow accounts will remain open until all bonds signed by the bonding entity under such an agreement are satisfied. 
(3)  Insurance companies. Applicants wishing to write bail bonds under the requirements of O.C.G.A. Title 33 provisions, must be approved and be currently certified by the state insurance commissioner. A copy of such certificate shall be provided with the application. The applicant's insurance company must be approved by the insurance commissioner and meet all requirements of O.C.G.A. Title 33, to do business in the state.

(a)  Each bondsman must be licensed by the state department of insurance. Any temporary status or licensing must be approved by the city attorney's office.

If while at the jail on business a bondsman is asked if he is a bondsman, he may answer in the affirmative and conduct business in the normal manner. The initiative must be on the part of the inmate or the public. 
(c)  All bondsmen must sign the sign-in book when entering the jail for the purpose of doing business as a bondsman. 
(d)  When called to come to the jail to write a bond, it is recommended that bondsmen call the jail and advise them they are coming, name of the inmate and his estimated time of arrival. This should preclude the problem of several bondsmen responding to the same call. The jail staff have been instructed to advise the second bondsman calling for the same inmate of the previous call, thereby eliminating unnecessary response to the jail. 
(e)  All bondsmen using insurance companies will provide a serialized power of attorney from the surety stating the limits of liability. A power of attorney must be provided with every bond written. These powers of attorney must be serialized and state a value covering the amount of the bond to be written. 
(f)  All bonding companies must provide a monthly statement to the chief of police by the 15th of the month with the name of each defendant actively on bond, the amount of the bonds, the number of the power of attorney, the date the bond was made and the current status of each bond. 
(g)  No bondsman may pay a fee, come to any arrangement with or give anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any employee that works for the city without specific written permission of the mayor and city council. 
(h)  An insurer terminating the appointment of a bondsman shall file a written notice of termination with the chief of police. This notice shall state the reasons, if any, for termination. 
(i)  Each bondsman shall charge a fee no more or less than that specified by state statutes. No professional bondsman, his agents or his employees who receive compensation for becoming the surety on a criminal bond shall thereafter receive any other sum in the case. If, before final disposition of the case, the surety surrenders the defendant who is the principal on the bond into the custody of the court, he must first return to the principal the compensation received for signing the bond as surety. 
(j)  Professional bondsmen, their agents or employees shall not advise defendants, principals in bonds signed by them, or give any directions in the defense or disposition of the cases in which bonds are signed. 
(k)  When a fi fa is issued, the bonding companies will be given 30 days before levy process is implemented against escrow accounts. If, at the end of 30 days the fi fa has not been satisfied, bonding privileges will be suspended. Suspension of bonding privileges for this reason is administrative and not punitive. The state insurance commission will be notified for whatever actions it deems necessary in the case of insurance companies. 
(l)  Any violation of these procedures may result in the suspension of privileges pending an investigation of the violation. If, after an investigation the violation is substantiated, revocation of future privileges may result. If it is found that the violation did not occur as alleged or suspected, the suspension will be lifted. Any allegations of procedure violations must be submitted in writing to the chief of police for consideration. 
(m)  A copy of these procedures will be incorporated into and maintained within the detention services policy and procedures manual: 
(1)  If a person has no other way to post bond and must hire a professional bondsman, it is his responsibility to choose a bonding company. It is also his responsibility to contact the bonding company he has chosen. No employee is allowed to contact any bondsman or bonding company on behalf of anyone under arrest, even if the person under arrest should request the employee to do so. 
(2)  Under no circumstances is an employee allowed to recommend a bondsman or bonding company. 
(3)  If a bondsman calls and wishes to be notified when a certain person is brought in, the request shall be refused. 
(4)  No employee on duty, engaged in accepting bonds, should converse with a bondsman any more than is necessary to complete the transaction at hand. 
(5)  After signing the bond, the bondsman must leave the jail property unless the bondsman has legitimate business with someone else in the department who is not on duty to accept bonds. 
(6)  No bondsman will be allowed to enter the book-in area without specific approval of the shift supervisor or his superior. 
(7)  No bondsman will be allowed to view any records, receipts or files unless they pertain to his immediate client and such information is deemed necessary by a shift supervisor or his superior. 
(8)  No bondsman will be allowed to leave business cards, memo pads or other forms of advertisement around the jail. Bonding company signs will be rotated once a week in an orderly fashion. 
(9)  No employee shall give special consideration to any one particular bonding company. An employee shall remain impartial at all times.

(b)  The following qualifications shall apply to all employees and managers: 
(1)  No certificate shall be issued until such time as a signed application has been filed with the city police department, chief of police or his designee and a search of the criminal record of the person completed.

(2)  The chief of police or his designee shall conduct a complete and exhaustive search relative to any police record of the applicant. 
(3)  In the event the applicant is qualified for employment in a pawnshop under this section and there is no record of a violation of this chapter, the chief of police or his designee shall issue a certificate to the applicant, by mail, stating that the person is eligible for employment. If it is found that the person is not qualified for a certificate and therefore ineligible for employment in a pawnshop, the chief of police or his designee shall notify the person in writing, that they are not eligible for employment, the cause of such denial and their right to appeal. 
(4)  No person who has been convicted or pled guilty or entered a plea of nolo contendere to any crime involving moral turpitude, illegal gambling, or any felonies, or any crime involving theft or fraudulent practices shall be issued a certificate for the five years preceding the date of application. For purposes of this chapter, a conviction or plea of guilt or nolo contendere entered under the Georgia First Offender Act, O.C.G.A. § 42-8-60 et seq., shall be ignored.

(8)  All certificates issued hereunder remain the property of the city police department, and shall be produced for inspection upon the demand of any officer or designee of the city police department or employee of the licensing and revenue department. 
(9)  No pawnshop owner shall allow any employee or manager to work on the premises unless the employee or manager has in their possession a current valid city certificate. For new employees, a receipt issued by the city police certificate unit may be used for a maximum of 30 days from the date of issue. Pawnshop owners are required by this chapter to inspect and verify that each employee or manager has in their possession a valid current pawnshop certificate. Issuance of this fee receipt shall allow the applicant to work in the position applied for only until such time as the required criminal history background investigation is completed. The temporary privilege conferred by issuance of this fee receipt shall expire immediately upon completion of such background investigation. If the background investigation indicates that the applicant does not meet the requirements for issuance of a pawnshop certificate, the applicant may appeal the denial of the certificate as provided in this chapter. However, issuance of this fee receipt and the temporary privilege granted thereby shall not be construed as conferring any right or privilege to the applicant to continue working in the position for which the certificate sought during the pendency of the appeal from the denial of a certificate under this chapter. 
(10)  It shall be the duty of all persons holding a pawnshop occupation tax certificate to file with the chief of police or his designee, the name of the establishment, the occupation tax certificate number and a list of all employees, including their date of birth, Social Security Number, home address and home telephone numbers twice annually; during the month of June and again during the month of December.

(b)  All tests shall be conducted in accordance with the following procedures: 
(1)  The noise investigator shall, to the extent practicable, identify all sources contributing sound to the point of measurement. 
(2)  Measurements shall be taken at or within the property line of the affected person, except when the affected party is in a multiunit residential building. In such a case the sound level is measured from any point inside the affected unit. 
(3)  The measuring instrument must be calibrated using a calibrator recommended by the measuring instrument manufacturer before and after each series of readings. 
(4)  No outdoor measurements shall be taken: 
a.  When wind speeds (including gusts) exceed 15 mph; 
b.  Without a windscreen, recommended by the measuring instrument manufacturer, properly attached to the measuring instrument; 
c.  Under any condition that allows the measuring instrument to become wet (e.g., rain, snow, or condensation); or 
d.  When the ambient temperature is out of the range of the tolerance of the measuring instrument. 
(c)  Prior to taking noise measurements the noise investigator shall explore the vicinity of the source in question to identify any other sound sources that could affect measurements, to establish the approximate location and character of the principal sound source, and to select suitable locations from which to measure the sound from the source in question. 
(d)  When measuring continuous sound, or sound that is sustained for more than one second at a time, the measuring instrument shall be set for A-weighting, slow response, and the range (if the measuring instrument is designed to read levels over different ranges) shall be set to that range in which the meter reads closest to the middle of the scale.

(Ord. of 3-28-2017 , § 1(Exh. A)) 
Sec. 34-209. - Minimum requirements for erosion and sedimentation control using best management practices. 
(a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of section 34-209(b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land- disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
(b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
(1)  Best management practices as set forth in section 34-209 (b) & (c) of this article shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 subsection (b). 
(2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
(5)  The local issuing authority may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in (c) (15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
(c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq.; 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in section 34-209 (b) (2) of this article; 
(15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25 foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow, unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the city and the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specification and are implemented: 
1.  Stream crossings for water lines; or 
2.  Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
(17)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with Chapter 5 of Title 12 of this title, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970." And the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to Code Section 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to Code Section 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
c.  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land- disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least 18 percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
d.  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than 500 square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than 5,000 square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the Division at least 14 days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
(d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing Authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in section 34-209(b) and (c) of this article. 
(e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit.

DIVISION 2. - APPLICATION/PERMIT PROCEDURES 

Sec. 34-220. - Application/permit process. 
(a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
(b)  Application requirements. 
(1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Suwanee without first obtaining a permit from the City to perform such activity and providing a copy of the notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
(2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the City and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in section 34-220(c) of this article. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of section 34-209(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by two copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-. 10. 
(3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of O.C.G.A 12-7-8 half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the Division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
(4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 34-209 (c) (15), (16) and (17) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per section 34-220 (b) (6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
(5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application.

Sec. 34-303. - Findings. 
    It is hereby determined that: 
(1)  The city separate storm sewer system was designed and installed to manage stormwater so as to prevent localized flooding, damage to property and risk to public safety; 
(2)  The city separate storm sewer system was not designed or installed as a receiving system for nonstormwater discharges; 
(3)  Discharges to the city separate storm sewer system that are not composed entirely of stormwater contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters; 
(4)  These nonstormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping and improper connections to the city separate storm sewer system from residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments; 
(5)  These nonstormwater discharges not only impact local waterways individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume nonstormwater discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving waters; 
(6)  The impacts of these nonstormwater discharges adversely affect public health and safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters; 
(7)  These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills, dumping and discharges into the city separate storm sewer system; 
(8)  Localities in the State of Georgia are required to comply with a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits which require a locality to address the impacts of nonpoint source pollution caused by nonstormwater discharges to the city separate storm sewer system; 
(9)  The Clean Water Act requires the management and maintenance of the city separate storm sewer system and the management of discharges to that system; 
(10)  Therefore, in order to prohibit such nonstormwater discharges to the city separate storm sewer system, it is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping and discharges to the city separate storm sewer system is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the environment.

Sec. 34-304. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this article is to protect the public health, safety, environment and general welfare through the regulation of nonstormwater discharges to the city separate storm sewer system to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal law. This article establishes methods for controlling the introduction of nonstormwater discharges into the city separate storm sewer system in order to comply with requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. The objectives of this article are to: 
(1)  Comply with all Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and Federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) stormwater regulations developed pursuant to the Clean Water Act; 
(2)  Prohibit illicit discharges and illegal connections to the city separate storm sewer system; 
(3)  Prevent nonstormwater discharges, generated as a result of spills, inappropriate dumping or disposal, to the city separate storm sewer system; and 
(4)  To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance, monitoring and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this article.

(1)  Raising the base flood elevation or future-conditions flood elevation equal to or more than 0.01 foot; 
(2)  Reducing the base flood or future-conditions flood storage capacity; 
(3)  Changing the flow characteristics as to the depth and velocity of the waters of the base flood or future- conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the development area; or, 
(4)  Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation. 
(b)  Any development within any area of special flood hazard or area of future-conditions flood hazard allowed under section 38.45(a) shall also meet the following conditions: 
(1)  Compensation for storage capacity shall occur between the average ground water table elevation and the base flood elevation for the base flood, and between the average ground water table elevation and the future-condition flood elevation for the future conditions flood, and lie either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed and shall be within the immediate vicinity of the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain, or lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain storage. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the natural (pre-development) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel; 
(2)  Cut areas shall be stabilized and graded to a slope of no less than 2.0 percent; 
(3)  Effective transitions shall be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased;

(Ord. of 3-24-2015, § 1(Exh. A)) 
Sec. 38-46. - Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments. 
    An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb any land within the future-conditions floodplain, except for a residential single-lot development on streams without established base flood elevations and floodways. This study shall be prepared by a current licensed professional engineer and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the City of Suwanee Planning and Inspections Director prior to the approval of any permit which would authorize the disturbance of land located within the future-conditions floodplain. Such study shall include: 
(1)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
(2)  Step-backwater analysis, using a FEMA-approved methodology approved by the City of Suwanee Planning and Inspections Director.

(Ord. of 3-24-2015, § 1(Exh. A)) 
Sec. 38-47. - Floodway encroachments. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity flood waters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except for activities specifically allowed in 15.80.040(E(2)) below; 
(2)  Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment will not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the base flood discharge. A licensed professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and, 
(3)  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the City of Suwanee Planning and Inspections Director until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) is issued by FEMA or a no-rise certification is approved by the City of Suwanee Planning and Inspections Director.

(4)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance issued shall be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(5)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(6)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(7)  In reviewing such requests, the City of Suwanee Planning and Inspections Director and the City of Suwanee Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
(8)  Conditions for variances: 
a.  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
1.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
3.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, or the creation of a nuisance. 
b.  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
c.  Any person to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance resulting from the lowest floor elevation being placed below the base flood elevation will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property, and that such costs may be as high as $25.00 for each $100.00 of insurance coverage provided. 
d.  The City of Suwanee Planning and Inspections Director shall maintain the records of all variances actions, both granted and denied, and report them to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.

ARTICLE IV. - REGULATION OF GRAFFITI 

Sec. 42-91. - Definitions. 
    Graffiti means the unauthorized inscription, defacing, damaging or destroying by spraying of paint or marking or engraving of ink, chalk, dye or other similar substances, or by carving or scratching on public or private buildings, structures, places and properties. 
    Graffiti abatement means the abatement procedure that identifies graffiti, issues notices to the landowner to abate the graffiti, and cures or removes such graffiti in absence of a response. 
    Private contractor means any person with whom the city shall have contracted to remove graffiti. 
(Ord. of 7-25-05, § I) 
Sec. 42-92. - Findings; nuisance. 
    The city council finds that graffiti is a public nuisance and destructive of the rights and values of property owners as well as the entire community. Unless the city acts quickly to remove graffiti from public and private property, the graffiti tends to remain. Other properties then become the target of graffiti, and entire neighborhoods are affected and become less desirable places in which to be, all to the detriment of the city. Further, the city finds that rapid or prompt removal (e.g. 24 to 48 hours) serves as a deterrent to future defacement and such defacement is less likely to reappear. 
    Graffiti and other defacement of public and private property, including walls, rocks, bridges, buildings, fences, gates, signage, and other structures, trees, and other real and personal property within the city constitutes a nuisance. 
(Ord. of 7-25-05, § II) 
Sec. 42-93. - Prohibited. 
    It shall be a violation of this chapter for any person to write, paint or draw, carve or scratch upon any wall, rock, bridge, building, fence, gate, signage and other structure, trees, and other real or personal property, either publicly or privately owned, any drawing, inscription, figure or mark of the type which is commonly known and referred to as "graffiti", to the extent the graffiti was not authorized in advance by the owner or occupant of the property, or, despite advance authorization, is otherwise deemed a public nuisance by the city. 
(Ord. of 7-25-05, § III) 
Sec. 42-94. - Violation. 
    A violation of any of the provisions of this section shall be punishable by either fine and/or incarceration in an amount and length not to exceed state law or as otherwise set forth in the City of Suwanee Code of Ordinances. Nothing herein shall prevent the additional remedy of restitution if appropriate. 
(Ord. of 7-25-05, § IV) 
Sec. 42-95. - Notice of removal. 
(a)  Whenever the city's code enforcement officer or police officer, or his/her designee, determines that graffiti exists on any public or private buildings, structures, and places which are visible to any persons utilizing any public road, parkway, alley, sidewalk or other right of way within the city and when weather conditions permit the painting of exterior surfaces, the city manager or his designee shall cause a notice to be issued to abate such nuisance. The property owner shall have two business days after the date of the notice to remove the graffiti or the same will be subject to abatement by the city. 
(b)  This notice to abate graffiti pursuant to this section shall be a written notice to be served upon the owner(s) of the affected premises, as such owner(s) name and address appears on the last property tax assessment rolls of Gwinnett County, Georgia. If there is no known address for the owner, the notice shall be sent in care of the property address. The notice required by this section may be served in any one of the following manners: 
(1)  By personal service on the owner, occupant or manager of the property; or 
(2)  By registered or certified mail addressed to the owner at the last known address of said owner. If this address is unknown, the notice will be sent to the property address. 
(Ord. of 7-25-05, § V) 
Sec. 42-96. - City costs enforceable as a lien. 
    Any and all costs incurred by the city in the abatement of the graffiti nuisance as provided in this chapter shall constitute a debt owed to the city by the property owner and shall be enforceable as a lien against the property which such nuisance existed, in addition to the other legal remedies available for enforcement of debts. Any abatement procedure shall be in accordance with the City of Suwanee Code of Ordinances. 
(Ord. of 7-25-05, § VI) 
Sec. 42-97. - Removal by city. 
    Upon failure of persons to comply with the notice by the designated date, or such continued date thereafter as set forth by the city's officer, then the graffiti may be abated by the city or by private contractor, and the city or its private contractor is expressly authorized to enter the premises for such purposes during regular business hours or at times mutually agreeable with the property owner or occupant. All reasonable efforts to minimize damage from such entry shall be taken by the city. If the city provides for the removal of the graffiti, it shall not authorize or undertake to provide for the painting or repair of any more extensive area than the area where the graffiti is located. When graffiti is painted over, the city or its private contractor shall attempt to match the paint with the underlying color of the defected surface. Property owners in the City of Suwanee may consent in advance to the city entry onto private property for graffiti removal purposes but such consent is not mandatory. 
(Ord. of 7-25-05, § VII) 
Sec. 42-98. - Severability. 
    Should any section, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter, or its application to any person or circumstances, be declared unconstitutional or otherwise invalid for any reason, or should any portion of this chapter be pre-empted by state or federal law or regulation, such decision or pre-emption shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this chapter or its application to other provisions or circumstances. 
(Ord. of 7-25-05, § VIII) 
Sec. 42-99. - Provisions not mandatory. 
    It is the specific intent of this chapter that neither provision nor any term used in this chapter is intended to impose any duty whatsoever upon the city or any of its officers or employees, for whom the implementation and enforcement of this chapter shall be discretionary and not mandatory. 
    Nothing in this chapter is intended nor shall be construed to create or form the basis of any liability on the part of the city, or its officers, employees, or agents, for any injury or damage resulting from any action or inaction on the part of the city related in any manner to the enforcement of this chapter by its officers, employees, or agents.

Sec. 46-31. - Objectives and findings. 
    In an effort to maintain high quality, long-lasting and sustainable development within the city, the city adopts the following design guidelines and standards for all newly constructed buildings within RM-6, RM-8, C-1, C-2, C-3, O-I and M-1 zoning districts. These guidelines are intended to enhance the visual aspect and livability of the entire city. They are intended to encourage an old-town look and feel of historical state villages. These guidelines will foster architectural diversity and interest yet achieve and maintain a consistent, durable and pleasing aesthetic/visual quality. The use of a common palate of building materials should be maintained for all building facades to create a consistent and traditional architectural identity. Traditional architecture includes the use of red brick, pitched roofs, low-profile signage and subdued colors. For large commercial/retail buildings, variations in facade, roofline and depth should be provided to lend the appearance of multi-tenant occupancy.

The amount of permitted material shall be calculated using the gross square footage of wall area per facade. A building material that is allowed, such as brick, may be used in any percentage throughout the structure. A material that is restricted, such as stucco, is allowed as a maximum percentage. For example, if a building has a front facade with a gross facade area of 1,200 square feet with 400 square feet consisting of windows and doors, begin with 1,200 square feet for required building material calculations. In this case, the front facade of a building in the C-2 zoning district with a wall area of 1,200 square feet shall have no more than 300 square feet of stucco on the front facade (example: 1,200 × 25% = 300).

ARTICLE III. - CHATTAHOOCHEE RIVER WATERSHED PROTECTION 

Sec. 46-71. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted development. Land disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation which threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxicants, nutrients and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated and expensive and rendering water resources unusable for recreation. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacture, use, transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby public drinking water supplies. 
(b)  The city has determined that land inside the city lies within the Chattahoochee River water supply watershed. This watershed is greater than 100 square miles in size and is categorized as a large water supply watershed under the provisions of this article. As of the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, no portion of the city lies within seven miles upstream of an active water supply intake or water supply reservoir. 
(Ord. No. 99-001, § 1.1, 5-18-1999) 
Sec. 46-72. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply of the city; to minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply; and to maintain the yield of the water supply watershed. This article shall apply to the portions of the Chattahoochee River watershed which occur within the jurisdiction of the city and are identified as water supply watersheds in this article. 
(Ord. No. 99-001, § 1.2, 5-18-1999) 
Sec. 46-73. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Buffer means a natural or enhanced vegetated area located adjacent to a reservoir or perennial stream within a water supply watershed. 
    Corridor means all land within the buffer areas established adjacent to reservoirs or perennial streams within a water supply watershed. 
    Hazardous material/waste means any substance defined as hazardous waste by the state department of natural resources pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-8-60 et seq., as amended. 
    Impervious surface means a manmade structure or surface that prevents the infiltration of stormwater into the ground below the structure or surface. An example includes buildings, roads, driveways, parking lots, decks, swimming pools and patios. 
    Perennial stream means a stream that flows throughout the year as indicated by a solid blue line on the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) seven-minute topographic series maps (scale 1/24,000). 
    Setback means the distance that defines the width of a protective buffer, measured from the boundary of the feature of the landscape (e.g. a wetland or stream bank) that the buffer is designed to protect. 
    Water supply watershed means the drainage area (watershed) of lands upstream of a governmentally-owned public drinking water intake or water supply reservoir.

Secs. 46-123-46-155. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE V. - GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AREA PROTECTION 

Sec. 46-156. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  In order to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be ensured. Therefore, it is necessary to protect the subsurface water resources that the city and surrounding communities rely on as sources of public water. Groundwater resources are contained within aquifers which are permeable rock strata occupying vast regions of the subsurface. These aquifers are replenished by infiltration of surface water runoff in zones of the surface known as groundwater recharge areas. 
(b)  Groundwater is susceptible to contamination when unrestricted development occurs within significant groundwater recharge areas. Therefore, it is necessary to manage land use within groundwater recharge areas in order to ensure that pollution threats are minimized. 
(c)  According to available data provided by the state department of natural resources, the city contains significant groundwater recharge areas. According to the state groundwater pollution susceptibility map, the city is within an area having a low susceptibility rating (drastic rating less than 141). 
(Ord. No. 99-002, § 1.2, 5-18-1999) 
Sec. 46-157. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this article are to: 
(1)  Protect groundwater quality by restricting land uses that generate, use or store dangerous pollutants in recharge areas; 
(2)  Protect groundwater quality by limiting density of development; and 
(3)  Protect groundwater quality by ensuring that any development that occurs within the recharge area shall have no adverse effect on groundwater quality. 
(Ord. No. 99-002, § 1.3, 5-18-1999) 
Sec. 46-158. - Amendments. 
    The regulations of this article may be amended from time to time in accordance with procedures and requirements in the general statutes and as new information becomes available. 
(Ord. No. 99-002, § 7, 5-18-1999) 
Sec. 46-159. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Aquifer means any stratum (rock layer) or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. 
    Groundwater recharge area means an area of the Earth's surface where water infiltrates the ground thereby replenishing the groundwater supplies within an aquifer. 
    Hazardous material/waste means any substance defined as hazardous waste by the state department of natural resources pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-8-60 et seq., as amended. 
    Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of groundwater to pollution from chemical spills, leaching of pollutants from dump sites, animal waste from agricultural operations or pollution generated by other human activities. 
    Pollution susceptibility maps means maps prepared by the state department of natural resources that show the relative susceptibility of groundwater to pollution. Pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas of high, medium and low groundwater pollution potential. 
    Significant groundwater recharge areas means areas mapped by the state department of natural resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1989 edition. Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, lithology (chemical nature and form of the rock), soil type and thickness, slope, density of lithologic contacts, geologic structure, presence of karst topography (sinkholes, caves and fissures associated with limestone and other carbonate rocks) and potentiometric surfaces.

The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to abating the nuisance; taking possession of the facilities, evicting the utility from the right-of-way; prosecuting the violator; and/or any other remedy provided by city ordinance or otherwise allowed in law or in equity.

A utility who engages in an emergency excavation shall take all reasonable precautions to avoid or minimize damage to any existing facilities. 
(2)  In the event that the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding utility facilities, the city may attempt to contact the affected utility or facilities representative. The city may take whatever action it deems necessary in order to respond to the emergency, including cut or move any of the wires, cables, amplifiers, appliances, or other parts of the facilities.

(1)  City shall serve a utility with a written notice of the reason or cause for proposed termination and shall allow a utility a minimum of 15 calendar days to cure its breach.

(b)  Protection of traffic and roadway. Unless specifically in the permit, no utility may occupy the city rights-of-way unless sufficient space is available so that the free flow and safety of traffic and other capacity considerations are not unduly impaired and the installation does not prevent the city from reasonably maintaining the streets, structures, traffic control devices and other appurtenant facilities, and further provided that maintenance and operations of the facilities do not jeopardize the traffic, street structure, other users of the right-of-way or the right-of-way itself. 
(c)  Grading. If the grades or lines of any street within the city right-of-way are changed at any time by the city during the term of the permit and this change involves an area in which the utility's facilities are located, then the utility shall, at its own cost and expense and upon the request of the city upon reasonable notice, protect or promptly alter or relocate the facilities, or any part thereof, so as to conform with such new grades or lines. In the event the utility refuses or neglects to so protect, alter, or relocate all or part of the facilities, the city shall have the right to break through, remove, alter, or relocate all or any part of the facilities without any liability to the utility and the utility shall pay to the city the costs incurred in connection with such breaking through, removal, alteration, or relocation. 
(d)  Installation of poles and other wireholding structures and relocation. Unless otherwise provided in a valid service agreement, no placement of any pole or wireholding structure of the utility is to be considered a vested interest in the right-of-way, and such poles or structures are to be removed, relocated underground, or modified by the utility at its own expense whenever the city determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. The facilities shall be so located and installed as to cause minimum interference with the rights and convenience of property owners. 
(e)  As provided in O.C.G.A § 25-9-6 (the Georgia Utility Facility Protection Act) and other applicable state law currently in place or as amended, no utility shall commence, perform, or engage in blasting or in excavating with mechanized excavating facilities unless and until the utility planning the blasting or excavating has given 48 hours' notice by submitting a locate request to the utility protection center, beginning the next working day after such notice is provided, excluding hours during days other than working days.

Sec. 46-178. - Penalties. 
(a)  Every utility convicted of a violation of any provision of this chapter shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000.00 per violation.

(Ord. of  9-26-2017 ) 
Sec. 46-179. - Other provisions. 
(a)  Severability. If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or portion of this chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. 
(b)  Reservation of regulatory and police powers. The city by issuing a written approval of registration under this chapter, does not surrender or to any extent lose, waive, impair, or lessen the lawful powers and rights, which it has now or may be hereafter vested in the city under the Constitution and Laws of the United States, State of Georgia and the City Charter, and under the provisions of the city's codified ordinances to regulate the use of the rights-of-way. The utility by applying for and being issued a written permit, is deemed to acknowledge that all lawful powers and rights, regulatory power, or police power, or otherwise as are or the same may be from time to time vested in or reserved to the city, shall be in full force and effect and subject to the exercise thereof by the city at any time. A utility is deemed to acknowledge that its interests are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public and is deemed to agree to comply with all applicable general laws enacted by the city pursuant to such powers. In particular, all utilities shall comply with city zoning and other land use requirements pertaining to the placement and specifications of facilities.

(e)  False or fraudulent returns or estimates. Failure to supply complete or accurate information is punishable pursuant to this article. In addition to any other sanctions available, upon a finding that an estimated projection of gross receipts is unreasonable, or would result in a substantial underpayment of tax, the licensing and revenue officer may impose a reasonable estimate of gross receipts and compute the tax thereon.

(c)  If the amount paid for an occupational tax during the immediately preceding year, computed on the estimated gross receipts for the period, is more than the amount due as computed upon the final actual return, the overpayment difference shall be refundable to the business, or alternatively, if the business enterprise remains in existence, the overpayment may be credited towards the estimated occupational tax due for the current year. 
(d)  Refunds of the occupational tax shall be permitted where there has occurred a clerical error in the submission of a return or application, or where there has been discovered a clerical error in business classification or tax computation, or where there has been a voluntary or involuntary overpayment of the tax.

    Subject to the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 40-14-21, the chief of police and city council authorize the use of traffic-control signal monitoring devices for purposes of automated traffic enforcement.

Sec. 54-47. - Enforcement. 
    The City of Suwanee Police Department shall be responsible for the administration and enforcement of this ordinance as required by O.C.G.A. § 40-6-20. 
(Ord. of 11-15-2005) 
Sec. 54-48. - Civil penalty. 
(a)  Imposition of a penalty pursuant to this section shall not be deemed a conviction as an operator and shall not be made a part of the operating record of the person upon whom such liability is imposed nor shall it be used for insurance purposes in the provision of motor vehicle insurance coverage. The monetary penalty imposed by this section for each violation shall be equal to the fine issued by the City of Suwanee Municipal Court for disregarding a traffic device at the time of the alleged violation, (currently $70.00) and shall not include court costs. The monetary penalty imposed by this section for each violation shall double the amount of the fine issued by the City of Suwanee Municipal Court for disregarding a traffic device if the alleged violation occurs in a designated "school zone", as defined by Georgia State Law. 
(b)  The city may establish procedures for the collection of the civil penalties and may enforce the penalties by a civil action in the nature of a debt. 
(Ord. of 11-15-2005) 
Sec. 54-49. - Contesting the civil penalty. 
(a)  In accordance with O.C.G.A. § 40-6-20(D), liability shall be determined based upon a preponderance of the evidence. Prima-facie evidence that the vehicle described in the citation issued pursuant to this ordinance was operated in violation of O.C.G.A. § 40-6-20(a), together with proof that the defendant was at the time of such violation the registered owner of the vehicle, shall permit the trier of fact in its discretion to infer that such owner of the vehicle was the driver of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation. Such an inference may be rebutted if the owner of the vehicle: 
(1)  Testifies under oath in open court that he or she was not the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation. 
(2)  Presents to the court prior to the return date established on the citation a certified copy of a police report showing that the vehicle had been reported to the police as stolen prior to the time of the alleged violation. 
(3)  Submits to the court prior to the return date established on the citation a sworn notarized statement identifying the name of the operator of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation. 
(4)  Such presumption shall be rebutted if the recorded image depicts the vehicle passed through the intersection in violation of section 54-44 et seq. of the Suwanee City Code as part of a funeral procession. 
(5)  Such presumption shall be rebutted if the recorded image depicts the vehicle passed through the intersection in violation of section 54-44 et seq. of the Suwanee City Code in order to avoid impeding the efforts of an emergency vehicle to pass through the intersection. 
(6)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the recorded image detected by a traffic light signal violation monitoring system depicts the vehicle passed through the intersection in violation of section 54-44 et seq. of the Suwanee City Code is commercially licensed, then the owner of that vehicle shall be sent notice of the date, time and location of the alleged violation with at least two recorded images thereof. Within ten days of the receipt of said notice, the owner of the vehicle shall provide proof to the city of the name and address of the driver of the vehicle at the date, time and location of the violation and within the same time period, shall provide the driver of the vehicle with at least two recorded images of the alleged violation. After receipt by the city of the proof of the name address of the driver of the vehicle, the driver of the vehicle shall be prima facie responsible for such violation. Failure of the owner of the vehicle found to be in violation of section 54-44 et seq. of the Suwanee City Code to provide the name and address of the driver at the time of the violation within the period prescribed shall cause the owner to be held responsible. 
(b)  The provisions of this ordinance shall not limit law enforcement agencies to the use of traffic-control signal monitoring devices in enforcing O.C.G.A. § 40-6-20(a); and, when there is evidence obtained from another source or sources which constitutes a prima-facie case of a violation of O.C.G.A. § 40-6-20(a), such violation may be prosecuted as otherwise provided by law in lieu of, but not in addition to, enforcement under this ordinance. 
(Ord. of 11-15-2005) 
Sec. 54-50. - Warning period. 
    In accordance with O.C.G.A. § 40-6-20-(B), only warning notices and not citations for violations shall be sent during the 30-day period following the installation of any traffic-control signal monitoring device. 
(Ord. of 11-15-2005)

    A report regarding the use of any traffic-control signal monitoring device for the preceding calendar year shall be submitted in compliance with O.C.G.A. § 40-14-24. 
(Ord. of 11-15-2005) 
Sec. 54-52. - Severability.

SITE GRADING, STORMWATER DETENTION, CULVERTS AND
PIPED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, SOIL SEDIMENT CONTROL, AND BIG HAYNES
CREEK WATERSHED PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS
8.0.1 The water quality requirements contained in this Article are minimum
standards for the City, and are required as outlined except as may be
otherwise allowed by the City of Suwanee Planning Department.
Alternative means to achieve water quality standards may be
administratively approved when said requirements fully meet the intent
and standards of this Article.
8.1 SITE GRADING
8.1.1 Grading shall be done in accordance with the lines and grades shown on
the approved Grading Plan.
8.1.2 Grading plans shall show existing and proposed contour lines at an
interval of no more than 2 feet. Grading plans shall outline the areas
which are required to remain undisturbed (i.e., Tree Protection Areas,
buffer, etc.) and shall indicate protective fencing or staking to be placed
surrounding such areas.
8.1.3 If the property is within the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan River Protection
Act, the grading shall be consistent with the River Corridor Certificate
approved for the project.
8.1.4 Embankments shall be placed in uniform layers not to exceed a
compacted thickness of 6 inches per layer and shall be compacted to a
density of 95 percent of the maximum laboratory dry weight per cubic foot
as determined by AASHTO Method T-99 in all areas where structure,
parking lots and drives, streets, and utilities are to be placed. All other
embankments are to be compacted to at least 85 percent.
8.1.5 The maximum slopes for cut or fill shall be 2:1 (two feet of horizontal run
for each foot of rise or fall), except 1) for earthen dam embankments, 2)
for rock cuts, 3) where certified by a professional geotechnical engineer or
4) as discussed in Section 8.1.6 below. Earthen dam embankments shall
be 3:1 maximum unless a modification application is approved. The intent
of the earthen dam embankment slope regulation is to provide for public
safety, soil stability, and dam maintenance consideration. The depth of
cut referred to herein shall be the maximum cut or fill that shall be allowed
City of Suwanee Development Regulations
_________________________________________________________________
September 2, 2010 Revision Page 59
to occur in any one section of cut or fill. The slope of cut or fill shall be
uniform throughout for each section of cut or fill unless benching is
approved by the city. When a cut is made in rock that requires blasting,
the slope may be steeper if presplitting is employed and upon submission
of a geotechnical report which substantiates the integrity of the rock in the
steeper condition, subject to the review and approval of the Director.
(Note: No blasting shall occur unless a permit has been obtained from the
Fire Marshalls office.) Refer to the Standard Drawings for grading section
and retaining wall details.
8.1.6 While most soils in the area can be safely stabilized at a 2:1 slope, some
soils exhibit a low shearing resistance and a low cohesiveness. These
soils typically are micaceous silts and sandy soils with little or no clay. If
the 2:1 slope shows evidence of shearing, non-cohesiveness, sliding, or
inability to maintain compaction, the slope shall be stabilized at 3:1 or by
using such mechanical methods as needed (such as retaining walls or
"grow mats" stapled in place) to maintain slope, height, and integrity.
8.1.7 A grading plan showing building pad locations shall be submitted for
residential subdivisions, unless a modification application is approved,
zoned for a lot size of less than 12,000 square feet or a density of 4 units
per acre or more. The intent of this regulation is to ensure adequate lot to
lot drainage. Granting a modification will not nullify the intent of these
regulations when the layout has a minimum lot area of 14,520 square feet
and a minimum lot width of 90 feet. The grading plan may be used as a
construction document prior to approval of the Final Plat or as a guidance
document for individual lot grading after approval of the Final Plat.
8.1.8 Grading for roads and improved ditches shall be shown.
8.2 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
8.2.1 Storm Water Management Report Required
a. The purpose of a Storm Water Management Report is to support
the development of the project site using Best Management

b. The Storm Water Management Report shall identify the locations
and quantities of storm water runoff entering and exiting the site for
both pre- and post-developed conditions. Analysis of the off-site
properties shall anticipate future development in addition to
addressing existing conditions.
c. For the purposes of these regulations, the words "downstream"
and "analysis" shall have the following meanings. The analysis of
downstream conditions in the report shall address each and every
point or area along the project site's boundaries at which runoff will
exit the property. The analysis shall focus on the portion of the
drainageway "immediately" downstream from the project. This
area shall extend downstream from the project to a point in the
drainage basin where the project area is 10 percent of the total
basin area. The analysis shall be in accordance with the Gwinnett
County Stormwater Systems and Facilities Installation Standards
and Specifications.
d. The following criteria shall be evaluated by the authorized
registered professional (refer to Subsection 8.2.1. Paragraph a.)
preparing the Storm Water Management Report, and in
determining whether or not detention should be required for any
portion of any site:
(1) Existing land uses downstream;
(2) Anticipated future land uses downstream;
(3) Magnitude of increase in peak flows due to development;
(4) Presence of existing drainage problems;
(5) Capacity of existing and anticipated drainage systems;
(6) Creation of concentrated flows where none had occurred
previously;
(7) Availability of feasible locations for detention facilities;
(8) Existing flows generated off-site which pass through the
project site; and,
(9) The nature of the receiving watercourse.
e. Where detention for a proposed project is provided in a regional
detention facility that was permitted prior to February 17, 2001, the
developer shall provide a copy of the original study that met the
regulations at the time the facility was permitted. If the approved
study cannot be found, then the engineer shall provide a recreated
study. The project shall be exempt from restudy and any
City of Suwanee Development Regulations
_________________________________________________________________
September 2, 2010 Revision Page 61
modifications required to meet regulations effective after January 1,
2001, provided the proposed project is in keeping with the intent of
the original detention study and the detention facility is maintained.
f. When a development uses an existing facility where the last
approved certification and record drawing of the facility was over 18
months prior to the new developments submittal, the engineer shall
provide one of the following.
1) A new survey, drawing and certification showing that the outlet
structure is constructed as approved and the flood storage and
water quality volume of the facility is equal to or greater than the
volume required when the facility was approved.
2) Construction plans and calculations showing that the outlet
structure will function as designed and the flood storage and
water quality volume of the facility will be equal to or greater
than the volume required when the facility was approved once
the proposed maintenance has been performed.
3) A new record survey, drawing, study and certification showing
that the facility meets the development requirements when the
facility was approved.
g. Design Criteria  General.
All design related to storm water shall be in accordance with the
Gwinnett County Stormwater Systems and Facilities Installation
Standards and Specifications.
h. Evidence of Acquisition of Applicable Non-Local Permits
The applicant shall certify and provide documentation that all other
applicable environmental permits have been acquired for the site
prior to approval of the Storm Water Management Report.
8.2.2 Storm Water Detention Required
a. Whenever a Storm Water Management Report indicates that an
adverse impact from storm water runoff is expected to result from
the development of a property, that project shall be provided with
storm water detention facilities. The meaning of "adverse impact"
shall apply when pre-development flows did not cause difficulties
and post-development flows do. Difficulties shall include but not be
limited to situations where 25-year velocities exceed the nonerosive
velocity of the stream, habitable structures are shown to be
subject to increased depth of flooding for any frequency up to and
City of Suwanee Development Regulations
_________________________________________________________________
September 2, 2010 Revision Page 62
including the regulatory flood, and storm water facilities that can not
carry the design storm in accordance with these regulations.
b. Storm water detention facilities required in section 8.2.2.a shall be
provided, unless the authorized registered professional (refer to
Subsection 8.2.1. Paragraph a.) certifies and provides certified
documentation supporting the conclusion to the director that at
least one of the following is true and correct as applicable:
(1) The non-detained, post-development runoff will leave the
project site as sheet flow, and will not have an adverse
impact upon downstream properties. The increase for a 25-
year storm should not exceed 1 cfs over a length
perpendicular to the flow of 100 feet.
(2) The effect of detention would be to concentrate flows where
sheet flow had occurred under pre-developed conditions,
and any impact of increase sheet flows upon downstream
properties would be less adverse than that which would
result from the concentrated flows from a detention facility
even if energy dissipation devices were employed.
(3) The undetained flow will pass through downstream
properties, in drainage easements obtained by the
developer, to an existing detention facility which has been
designed to manage the upstream property's runoff or to the
point in the downstream analysis (see 8.2.1.c) which shows
that detention is not required.
(4) Where the site runoff will flow directly into a stream or lake
without crossing off-site properties:
(a) 24-hour detention of the 1-year storm is required if
water quality protection is required for the project.
(b) Only peak detention detention for the 2-year though the
25-year storm is not required if the downstream analysis
using timing of the hydrographs shows no adverse impact
from the exit of the site to the point immediately downstream
from the project in the drainage basin where the project area
is 10 percent of the total drainage basin area.
c. Should the authorized registered professional conclude that storm
water detention may not be necessary because of anticipated
compliance with Section 8.2.2.b., rigid compliance with all of the
following criteria is mandatory:
City of Suwanee Development Regulations
_________________________________________________________________
September 2, 2010 Revision Page 63
(1) A storm water management report shall always be required
whether or not storm water detention is required.
(2) If the applicant proposes to show that the detention
requirement may be eliminated for all or a portion of a
project, then a pre-submittal conference with the Department
staff is required prior to preparation and submittal of
construction plans for the project.
(3) At the pre-submittal conference with the staff, the consultant
shall be prepared to discuss the downstream analysis
findings as follows:
(a) The affected stream must be analyzed downstream
from the project to a point where the project area is
10 percent of the total drainage basin. The analysis
must include all culverts, obstructions, existing and
potential erosion problems, elevations of existing
improvements, and any other existing modifications to
natural conditions; and,
(b) If the existing downstream conditions are
overburdened by the pre-developed flows in the
stream, then detention shall be required unless the
developer elects to eliminate the downstream
overburdened conditions at his or her expense when
the development occurs; and,
(c) If there are any existing drainage complaints
downstream, then detention shall be required unless
the developer elects to minimize the conditions
causing the complaint at his or her expense when the
development occurs.
8.2.3 Detention Design Criteria - General
a. All storm water detention pond hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
and design calculations shall be certified by the authorized
registered professional (refer to Subsection 8.2.1. Paragraph a.).
The design shall be in accordance with the Gwinnett County
Stormwater Systems and Facilities Installation Standards and
Specifications.
b. All storm water detention facilities shall be designed to detain the 1-
year storm runoff, for the area draining to the pond, for 24 hours.
For the project, this volume called the channel protection volume,
shall be equal to or greater than the 1-year storm runoff volume
City of Suwanee Development Regulations
_________________________________________________________________
September 2, 2010 Revision Page 64
from the project. In addition, these facilities shall control the peak
flow rates associated with storms having 2-year, 5-year, 10-year,
and 25-year return frequencies so that flows from the developed
site do not exceed those associated with pre-development
conditions at the project boundary nor increase the peak flows
downstream from the project to the point in the drainage basin
where the project area is 10 percent of the total basin. Where
adverse impacts, as defined in section 8.2.2.a, occur during the
100-year storm, the 100-year storm shall also be regulated.
c. The hydrologic methodology used for any given project shall
conform to the Gwinnett County Stormwater Systems and Facilities
Installation Standards and Specifications.
d. Runoff coefficients and runoff Curve Numbers used for pre- and
post-development conditions shall be consistent with those shown
in the Gwinnett County Stormwater Systems and Facilities
Installation Standards and Specifications. The USGS Method shall
be used where applicable to check the magnitude of peak flows
when other hydrologic methods recommended in the manual are
used.
e. Calculations shall be provided showing how all times of
concentration or lag times were computed, both for pre- and postdeveloped
conditions. Likewise, adequate support must be
provided for all composite runoff coefficients or curve numbers
used.
8.2.4 Detention Facility Location Criteria
a. For purposes of these Regulations, a detention facility shall be
deemed to consist of the area within the maximum design ponding
limits unless a modification application is approved, the dam (if
one) including all embankment slopes and wall footings (if
applicable), primary and emergency outlet works, any drainage and
access easements, and any energy dissipation devices. The intent
of these regulations is to ensure that the extent of the facility is
defined to allow flooding, access and maintenance. Granting of a
modification will not nullify these regulations when the facility is a
wet pond or lake, the area within the maximum design ponding
limits is reduced to a few feet inside the normal pool elevation, and
easements are provided on the perimeter properties to allow for
City of Suwanee Development Regulations
_________________________________________________________________
September 2, 2010 Revision Page 65
flooding, access and maintenance around the lake. In addition,
granting of the modification shall only be considered when the wet
pond is an amenity and under no circumstances shall the dam and
outlet structure lie on private property.
b. Detention facilities, to the greatest extent feasible, shall be located
so as to minimize the amount of flow generated on the project site
that bypasses the facility.
c. No portion of any detention facility shall disturb any required (as
opposed to voluntary) buffer, landscape strip, or tree protection
area, except that natural bottom detention ponds and its
appurtenant structures, which require no grading and removal of
trees, may encroach into a required construction buffer.
d. The 100-year ponding limits of a detention facility shall not
encroach upon a public right-of-way.
e. Detention facilities may be located within utility easements or rightsof-
way, or encroach upon utility easements or rights-of-way, upon
receipt by the Department of written permission from both the
property and utility owners.
f. Detention facilities may be constructed within recreation areas
required under Section 5.9 of these Regulations, if the following
criteria are met:
(1) Ownership of the area will be held by a Qualified Property
Owners Association, Homeowners Association, or other
private parties.
(2) Permanent structures, such as buildings and swimming
pools, will not be constructed within the boundaries of the
detention facility.
(3) Detention facilities within recreation areas will be approved
only if the design of the area includes recreation amenities
such as ball fields, tennis courts, grassed open areas or
other similar improvements. The intent is to provide
recreation facilities with detention as a secondary feature.
(4) Permanent detention features shall not interfere with the
intended used of the recreation amenity, (i.e., a ditch or
large swale shall not traverse a ball field, an inlet structure
shall not be in a tennis court, etc.).
g. If a residential subdivision is provided with an on-site detention
facility not located within a recreation area as specified in 8.2.4.f
above, a mandatory property owners' association shall be
established for its ownership and maintenance. The facility shall
City of Suwanee Development Regulations
_________________________________________________________________
September 2, 2010 Revision Page 66
be located on a single lot within the development and owned by the
property owners association. The lot shall have a minimum of 30
feet of public road frontage and a minimum lot width of 30 feet. If
the project is provided with an off-site detention facility, a
mandatory property owners association shall be established for its
maintenance. The association bylaws shall be recorded
concurrently with the recording of a final subdivision plat. The
association bylaws shall include the same provisions as specified in
Subsection 5.9.2, Paragraph b. of this regulation.
h. A non-residential subdivision is not required to locate an on-site
detention facility on a separate lot. The property owners served by
a detention facility that provides detention for more than one
property owner or is located off-site shall enter into a maintenance
agreement acceptable to the county for the facility's maintenance.
However, if desired by the developer, the facility may be located on
a separate lot if it is owned and maintained by a mandatory
property owners association.
8.2.5 Detention Facility Easement Requirements
a. In a non-residential subdivision or project, an easement at least 20
feet in width shall be required so as to provide access to all detention
facilities from a public street.
b. In a residential subdivision, an easement at least 30 feet in width
shall be required so as to provide access to all detention facilities
from a public street.
c. Access Easement
1. The access easement shall be cleared, grubbed and graded
so that it can be utilized by rubber-tired construction
vehicles.
2. The minimum drive width shall be 15 feet.
3. The drive shall be grassed or paved.
4. The maximum slope shall be 20% (5H:1V).
5. Access easements may be combined with drainage
easements containing an open channel; however, the
combined easement shall be a minimum of 30 feet in width
and shall be wide enough for the drainage channel and the
drive.

mandatory property owners association to maintain the operational
characteristics of any facility constructed on their property for storm
water detention pursuant to City requirements, to keep the access
drive free of obstructions, and to maintain the facility free of
obstruction, silt or debris.
c. In a non-residential subdivision or project served by a detention
facility that provides detention for more than one property or by an
off-site facility, the property owners shall enter into a maintenance
agreement with the City for maintenance of the operational
characteristics of the facility pursuant to City requirements, to keep
the access drive free of obstructions, and to maintain the facility
free of obstruction, silt or debris.

ARTICLE 9
PERFORMANCE GUIDELINES
9.1 GENERAL
9.1.1 Purpose
The sections enumerated in this article are guidelines, and are intended to
be benchmark indicators of what standards could be acceptable. They
are further intended to allow alternate designs which could produce
results similar to these performance standards and similar protection to
the public. The objective of these performance standards is not to
suggest a single methodological standard of acceptance exclusive of all
others. Rather they establish what would otherwise be allowed in the
absence of an acceptable alternative.
9.1.2 Constraints
The alternative design solutions are constrained by the Design
Requirements of Article 5, the Access Requirements and Street and
Right-of-Way Requirements and the Street Construction Standards of
Article 6, and the Grading, Detention, Drainage Requirements of Article 8,
as well as the Purpose and Intent of these Regulations.
9.1.3 Documentation Required
In the event that an alternative is suggested by the applicant, studies and
reports conducted by professionals currently certified in the State of
Georgia will be required to be submitted to and approved by the
Department. These studies and reports must clearly relate to the desired
results and purposes expressed or implied in the applicable performance
standard. Once an alternative has been approved by the Department, it
shall become a required standard applicable to the specific approved
permit only.
9.2 LOTS
9.2.1 Lots should be designed generally such that they are no more than four
times as deep as they are wide at the building setback line, unless
excepted by the Director.
a. The Department may require notation that a House Location Plan
City of Suwanee Development Regulations
_________________________________________________________________
September 2, 2010 Revision Page 80
(HLP) is required to be approved prior to issuance of a building
permit on certain lots when particular care in locating the house or
other improvements will be necessary. Such lots include, but are not
limited to:
(1) a lot which presents particular or unusual difficulties for a
builder to meet minimum required building setbacks;
(2) a lot upon which is located an easement of unusual
configuration;
(3) a lot containing floodplain but upon which no fill or other
encroachment into the floodplain is anticipated at the time
the Final Plat is filed;
(4) a lot upon which is located all or a part of a stormwater
detention facility;
(5) a lot upon which is located a buffer which was required by
the Zoning Ordinance as a condition of zoning approval;
(6) all duplex lots;
(7) all lots within, or partially within, the Chattahoochee River
Corridor, or containing a River Corridor Tributary Buffer
Zone.
b. The Department may require notation that a Residential Drainage
Plan (RDP) is required to be approved prior to issuance of a building
permit o certain lots where additional (site specific) engineering will
be necessary to properly grade the lot or locate the building or other
improvements. Such lots include, but are not limited to:
(1) a lot containing floodplain where fill or other encroachment
into the floodplain is planned or reasonably expected;
(2) a lot containing severe topographic features interdicting the
building site;
(3) a lot containing a drainage easement with a pipe discharge or
other facilities, or flow characteristics which may adversely
affect the location of a building or other site improvements.
c. The Department may require notation that a Residential Drainage
Study (RDS) is required to be approved prior to issuance of a
building permit o certain lots where particular attention to site grading
will be necessary, but formal engineering is not needed. Such an
RDS is conducted in the field where the effect of the site grading
must be accomplished with adequate care so as not to create a
drainage problem on neighboring property.
City of Suwanee Development Regulations
_________________________________________________________________
September 2, 2010 Revision Page 81
9.2.2 Side lot lines generally should be at right angles (90 degrees) to straight
street lines or radial to curved street lines as much as practical. Side lot
lines should be radial to the radius points of all cul-de-sacs. Variations of
more than 10 degrees shall require approval of the Department, but shall
be approved when appropriate to the reasonable loading pattern of the
subdivision, efficient use of the land relative to topographic conditions, or
provisions of improved building sites over those which would result without
variation of the side lot lines.
9.2.3 Corner lots shall be sufficiently larger so that they have the same width
between minimum side setback lines as an interior lot, but in no case shall
more than 75 feet between side setback lines on a corner lot be required.
9.3 BLOCKS
9.3.1 The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be determined with regard
to:
a. Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs
of the type of use contemplated,
b. Applicable zoning requirements as to lot size and dimensions,
c. Needs for convenient access, circulation, control, and safety of
street traffic,
d. Limitations and opportunities of topography.
9.3.2 In blocks over 1,000 feet long, the Director may, when existing or
proposed pedestrian circulation patterns or public gathering places so
justify, require pedestrian ways or pedestrian access easements, as
appropriate, through the block.
9.4 ACCESS
A maximum number of 200 residential dwelling units shall be allowed to
be constructed with only one street outlet to an existing public street. If a
second access to an existing public road is not available or, in the opinion
of the Director, could induce non-residential traffic through the
development, a single entrance may be allowed if designed with a traffic
signal and/or sufficient right-of-way and improvements to provide a
protected left-turn lane, subject to the approval of the Engineering

by the Department, based on adequate engineering designs, where
at least 1.5% cannot reasonably be achieved due to topographical
limitations imposed by the land. In such cases, a Record Drawing
and such computations as necessary shall be provided after
construction to establish that the street will drain in accordance with
these Regulations. Street sections where unacceptable pooling,
excessive spread at catch basins, or other hazardous conditions
occur shall be reconstructed or otherwise improved to eliminate such
conditions.

assigned to the street according to its category (i.e., L=KA).
b. Constant (K) values are shown in the Table 9-B for both desirable
and minimum acceptable ("hardship") conditions. In all cases, the
"desirable" value shall be used, unless it cannot be achieved due to
topographic conditions beyond the developer's control. In such
hardship situations, the Department may approve a lesser value to
the extent required by the hardship situation, but in no event less
than the value shown in the Table as "minimum."

the driveway in both directions along the right-of-way line of the
intersecting street. As an alternative, the minimum corner sight distance
requirement may be calculated using AASHTO "Policy on Geometric
Design of Highways and Streets," Chapter 0 (at-grade intersections),
latest edition. The sight distance shall provide clear visibility of an object
4 feet above the intersecting street viewed from the centerline of the
driveway at the right-of-way line of the intersecting street, at a height of
3.5 feet above the ground.
9.7.5 Separation and Spacing
All driveways except those serving residential units on individual lots shall
be recommended to meet the following criteria:
a. Minimum separation from a street intersection: 100' from centerline
of driveway to nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting street,
extended. For any driveway on a major thoroughfare having a
centerline between 100' and 200' from the intersecting street right-ofway
line, access restriction may be imposed to avoid traffic hazards.
Greater separation may be required for safe operation of a free-right
lane, acceleration or deceleration lane, etc.
b. Minimum separation between driveways along the same side of a
major thoroughfare: 100' between centerline as measured along the
City of Suwanee Development Regulations
_________________________________________________________________
September 2, 2010 Revision Page 92
roadway edge or back of curb.
c. Whenever possible, proposed driveways along one side of a street
shall coincide with existing or proposed driveways on the opposite
side of such street.
d. Maximum number of driveways serving a single project: one (1) for
each 400' of property frontage, or fraction thereof per street, along a
major thoroughfare. This is not meant to be a spacing standard but
only an expression of the total number of driveways that are
permitted serving a single project.
9.8 STORMWATER DETENTION GUILDELINES
9.8.1 General
a. Storm water detention facilities shall be designed so that their peak
release rates, when combined with those of all detention bypass
areas in the same basin, produce peak flowrates and flow
velocities at the site's boundary line no greater than those which
occurred at the same location for pre-developed conditions.
b. The positive effects of storm water management via on-site
detention facilities diminish rapidly as the distance downstream from
the point of discharge increases, and the smaller the facility's
contribution is, as a percentage of the total runoff contributing to
downstream flow, the shorter the distance downstream that the
benefits are realized. Because of these limitations, on-site detention
is effective at controlling flooding only when flow from the facility is a
significant percentage of the total flow at the point of interest, and
only if the point of interest is immediately downstream. The
concepts of immediately downstream and significant percentage of
total flow are inseparable. The portion of a receiving watercourse
(one which receives and conveys runoff from a site) which lies
downstream from the site to the point where the area of the site is 10
percent of the total drainage area, shall generally be considered to
constitute that portion of the watercourse which is immediately
downstream. However, the total flow in the receiving watercourse
may become very large, relative to the flow contributed by the site,
within a much shorter distance. For this reason, the significant
percentage test must also always be applied. For purposes of these
Regulations, the flow from a site represents a significant percentage
of the total flow in a watercourse only when the ratio of the peak flow
City of Suwanee Development Regulations
_________________________________________________________________
September 2, 2010 Revision Page 93
rate from the site to the peak flow rate in the watercourse (including
the contribution from the site) is greater than 5 percent.
c. Peak flowrate control shall normally be provided only for the 2-year,
5-year, 10-year, and 25-year frequency storm events. However,
under certain conditions, the 100-year event must also be detained
to the pre-developed rate. Such control of the 100-year event shall
be provided when failure to do so would result in flooding of other
habitable dwellings, property damage, or public access and/or
utility interruption.
d. For any storm water analysis, the composite "C" (Rational Method)
or CN (SCS Method) used for analysis of pre-development
conditions shall not exceed 0.25 or 60, respectively, unless prior
approval has been obtained from the Department. A pre-design
conference between the design engineer and appropriate
Department personnel, which may in certain straightforward cases
be conducted via the telephone, is required.
e. Rational Method runoff coefficients used for analysis of pre- and
post-development conditions shall be consistent with those shown
in the Storm Water Design Manual.
9.8.2 Dam Design and Construction Criteria
a. Detention facilities which take the form of normally-dry basins,
ponds, or lakes usually are created by damming a drainage way or
watercourse. Such dams can take a variety of different forms, the
most common being earthen embankments and reinforced
concrete walls. Each type of dam has different characteristics, and
the selection of the most appropriate type for a particular site
should be made by a Professional Engineer and based on the
physical features of the dam site, the purpose of the dam, the type
of impoundment, safety, and maintenance requirements.
b. For purposes of these Regulations, dams will be addressed
separately for each of the three most frequently encountered types
of detention facilities: normally-dry basins, ponds, and lakes. A
normally-dry basin is one designed to impound storm water runoff
for only a brief period of time following a storm event. The vast
majority of the time the basin will be completely dry except for any
normal stream flows which pass through unimpeded. Lakes and
City of Suwanee Development Regulations
_________________________________________________________________
September 2, 2010 Revision Page 94
ponds, on the other hand, are designed to impound a body of water
at least several feet in depth on a more-or-less permanent basis.
Lakes and ponds vary from one another only in terms of
magnitude. The magnitude of a lake is determined primarily from
the height of its dam, the size of its contributing drainage area, and
the volume of water it is capable of impounding. For purposes of
these Regulations, a pond is any lake having a dam height of less
than 9 feet and which is incapable of impounding more than 20
acre-feet of water.
c. All dam design shall be certified by a Professional Engineer
currently registered in the State of Georgia.
d. Dams for normally-dry detention basins shall conform to the
following:
(1) Dams for normally-dry detention basins may be constructed
of earth, reinforced concrete, mortared rubble, or other
suitable materials.
(2) The design of any concrete or rubble wall over 5 feet in
height shall be certified by a Structural Engineer currently
registered as a Professional Engineer in the State of
Georgia, and the structural design shall be based on soil
tests certified by a Geotechnical Engineer currently
registered as a Professional Engineer in the State of
Georgia.
(3) Any non-earthen structure shall be designed to prevent
piping failure through its subgrade and abutments.
(4) The construction of walls over 5 feet in height shall be
monitored and approved by a qualified materials testing
company.
(5) Earthen dams for normally-dry detention basins shall have a
top width of no less than 8 feet.
(6) For earthen dams for normally-dry detention basins, there
shall be at least 1.5 feet of vertical separation between the
100-year ponding elevation in the basin and the low point on
the top of the dam. One (1) foot of this distance is to
provide a margin of safety against overtopping of the dam
and the other 6 inches is to allow for settlement. Separation
is not required for a non-earthen dam if it has been designed
to overtop safely.
(7) More stringent design and construction criteria shall be used
City of Suwanee Development Regulations
_________________________________________________________________
September 2, 2010 Revision Page 95
for dams for normally-dry detention basins whenever the
probable consequences of dam failure are severe.
e. Dams for ponds shall conform to the following:
Any engineer responsible for the design of a dam for a pond is
expected to be knowledgeable of the criteria contained within the
Georgia Safe Dams Act, Georgia Department of Natural Resources
"Rules for Dam Safety" publication, and the U.S.D.A. Soil
Conservation Service's Technical Release No. 60 "Earth Dams and
Reservoirs." The provisions of each are to be applied wherever
applicable. Applicability shall be determined based upon sitespecific
constraints and downstream conditions. Consultation with
appropriate Department personnel both prior to and throughout the
design process is encouraged.
f. Dams for lakes shall conform to the following:
Any engineer responsible for the design of a dam for a lake is
expected to be thoroughly familiar with the criteria contained within
the Georgia Safe Dams Act, Georgia Department of Natural
Resources "Rules for Dam Safety" publication, and the U.S.D.A.
Soil Conservation Service's Technical Release No. 60 "Earth Dams
and Reservoirs." All design is to be in accordance with the
applicable requirements contained in each of the above referenced
publications.
9.8.3. Detention Facility Outlet Devices
a. Because of the variables that may be associated with the choice of
an outlet device for any given condition, the design consultant is
responsible for the selection of the device, subject to the review
and approval of the Department.
b. The Department will include in its consideration the ease of
maintenance, longevity of the system, freedom from congestion,
practicality, and aesthetics in its review of the outlet device. The
consultant should be guided by the Departmental preference of
vertical weir designs since they have proven to generally meet most
of the considerations expressed herein.
c. Orifices shall not be smaller than 3 inches in diameter. An orifice
smaller than 15 inches in diameter shall be protected by a trash
rack. A trash rack protecting an orifice shall have surface area of
City of Suwanee Development Regulations
_________________________________________________________________
September 2, 2010 Revision Page 96
at least 10 square feet. Design shall be in accordance with the
Storm Water Design Manual. No opening in the trash rack shall
have an area more than one-half the size of the area of the orifice
being protected. Two-stage trash racks, or screens having
progressively smaller openings placed in series, are suggested. To
facilitate outlet operation, curved or inclined trash racks designed to
allow debris to rise with the water level are preferred. In all cases,
trash racks shall be either hinged or removable to facilitate
maintenance operations.
d. If the primary detention facility outlet is a conduit through a dam,
and there is not an orifice, weir-box, or other flow-control device
affixed to the upstream end, then the conduit shall be analyzed for
both inlet and outlet control conditions. If an orifice or weir-box is
affixed, then the conduit shall be analyzed to determine if any flows
will occur for which outlet control conditions in the conduit, rather
than the hydraulic characteristics of the flow-control structure, will
determine the total flows occurring. In any case where the conduit
through the dam is less than 15 inches in diameter, the trash rack
provisions of "c" above shall be followed.
e. Unless the 100-year maximum flow velocity in a conduit through a
dam forming a pond or a lake is less than 10 feet per second, and
the hydraulic grade line for the 100-year condition is at or below the
crown of the conduit for at least 90 percent of its length, the conduit
must be equal or superior to Class V reinforced concrete pipe in its
structural characteristics.
9.8.4 Emergency Overflow Requirements
a. For every type of detention facility, a planned safe flowpath must
be provided for conveyance of flows of water in excess of those for
which the detention facility was designed. In many instances, this
function can be provided through installation of an emergency
spillway. Emergency spillways are usually excavated open
channels, either vegetated or paved with reinforced concrete.
b. Every earthen dam shall be provided with an open-channel
emergency spillway, unless all of the following apply:
(1) The principal spillway is a closed conduit having a crosssectional
area that can pass 125 percent of the 100-year
City of Suwanee Development Regulations
_________________________________________________________________
September 2, 2010 Revision Page 97
storm routed peak discharge.
(2) The principal spillway is a closed conduit having a crosssectional
are of at least one square foot per each three
acres of drainage area, or a maximum of twenty square feet
of surface area, whichever is less.
(3) The principal spillway capacity is at least equal to the
capacity required for an open-channel emergency spillway.
(4) The low point of the dam crest is not in a fill section except
for roadway embankments.
(5) A trash rack or other debris protection is provided on the
outlet control.
c. Any portion of any emergency spillway excavated into a dam
embankment or other fill section must be paved. Pavement
material shall be either reinforced concrete or asphalt, as dictated
by the design life of the dam and the potential consequences of its
failure. Any portion of any emergency spillway excavated into
natural ground shall be vegetated in accordance with the practices
described in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in
Georgia."
d. In determining the necessary dimensions of an open-channel
spillway for a normally-dry basin, a pond, or a lake, the
methodology contained in the "Earth Emergency Spillway Design
Data" section of the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in
Georgia" should be used.
e. Emergency spillway capacity for dams shall be as follows:
(1) For normally-dry detention basins, ponds, and lakes, having
a dam height of less than 9 feet and which are incapable of
impounding more than 20 acre-feet of water, and for which
the probable sequences of dam failure are not severe, an
emergency should be provided. Its capacity should be at
least equal to the difference between the routed 100-year
peak flow into the detention facility assuming the principal
spillway is.
(2) For normally dry detention basins, ponds, and lakes, having
a dam height of 9 feet or more and which are capable of
impounding 20 acre-feet or more of water, an emergency
spillway should be provided. Its capacity should be at least
equal to the greater of either the routed 100-year peak flow
City of Suwanee Development Regulations
_________________________________________________________________
September 2, 2010 Revision Page 98
rate out of the facility assuming the principal spillway is
blocked, or the routed one-fourth PMF hydrograph out of the
facility. In cases when State or Federal regulations may
require greater spillway capacity, those more stringent
regulations shall govern.
f. Emergency overflow for non-earthen dams may take the form of
planned structure overtopping. In such cases, however, care must
be taken to prevent flows from eroding supporting soils along the
toe of or immediately downstream from the dam so as the cause it
to be undermined. The profile of the top of the dam shall be so
designed as to prevent flows along the ends of the structure which
might result in abutment erosion.
9.8.5 Parking Lot Detention Facilities
a. Parking lot detention facilities shall generally be of one of the two
following types:
(1) Depressed areas of pavement at drop inlet locations; and,
(2) Ponding areas along sections of raised curbing. The curbing
in these areas is usually higher than a standard curbed
section.
b. The detention methodology utilized for all parking lot detention
facility design shall conform to the Storm Water Design Manual.
c. Parking lot detention areas shall be located so as to restrict
ponding to areas other than parking spaces near buildings, and to
not encroach upon entrance drives.
d. The maximum depth of detention ponding in a parking lot, except at
a flow control structure, shall be 6 inches for a 10-year storm, and 9
inches for a 100-year storm. The maximum depth of ponding at a
flow control structure shall be 12 inches for a 100-year storm.
e. In truck parking areas, the maximum depth of ponding shall be 12
inches for the 10-year storm.
f. Detention ponding areas are to be drained within 30 minutes after
the peak inflow occurs.
City of Suwanee Development Regulations
_________________________________________________________________
September 2, 2010 Revision Page 99
g. Parking lot detention areas shall have a minimum surface slope of
1 percent, and a maximum slope of 5 percent.
9.8.6. Underground and Rooftop Detention Facilities
The design of underground or rooftop detention facilities shall be in
accordance with current engineering standard practice, and shall conform
to the general spirit and intent of this Article. In the case of rooftop
detention, permissible structural loads and weatherproofing shall be
governed by the Georgia State Building Code as may be amended by the
County.
9.8.7. Sediment Basins
a. Stormwater management and sediment trapping functions should
be separated whenever possible. Every erosion control design
should seek to: first, prevent erosion from occurring; second, trap
sediments as close to their sources as possible, and: third, provide
a second-tier or backup line of defense against sediments leaving
the project site. This backup defense will usually consist of check
dams/and or sediment basins.
b. Whenever a sediment basin and a detention facility are both
required on the same watercourse, the sediment basin should be
located immediately upstream of the detention facility.
c. In unusual cases where a normally-dry detention basin is planned
to be used to trap sediment as well as provide stormwater control,
the basin may be undercut to accommodate the sediment so that
the required detention characteristics, particularly volume, will be
maintained.
d. The design of sediment basins shall be in accordance with
Appendix C of the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in
Georgia."
9.8.8 Ponds and Lakes Not Used for Detention
In such cases where a pond or lake is provided as part of a development,
but is not planned to function as a stormwater detention facility, the same
general and specific criteria contained in these Regulations shall apply, but
may be modified in instance where a specific requirement is clearly
detention oriented rather than safety-based.
City of Suwanee Development Regulations

September 2, 2010 Revision Page 100
9.9 CULVERTS AND PIPE COLLECTION SYSTEM GUIDELINES
9.9.1 Culverts
a. Single barrel or single cell culvert structures are less prone to
clogging and require less maintenance than multi-barrel or multicell
installations and should therefore be used whenever feasible.
b. The maximum velocity in a corrugated metal culvert for the 100-
year flow shall be 15 fps (feet per second). Velocities over 10 fps
in a pipe of any material shall be considered a special design with
particular attention required to pipe or structure invert protection
and to fill slope, stream bed, and stream bank stability.
c. The minimum allowable slope shall be in accordance with the
Storm Water Design Manual.
9.9.2 Pipe Collection Systems
a. The maximum velocity in a corrugated metal pipe system for the
design flow shall be 15 fps. Velocities over 10 fps in a pipe of any
material shall be considered a special design with particular
attention required to pipe invert protection and the ability of the
receiving waterway or detention facility to accept the flow without
damage.
b. The minimum allowable slope shall be in accordance with the
Storm Water Design Manual.
c. The maximum allowable slope for a concrete storm drainage pipe
shall be 10 percent, for a corrugated metal pipe shall be 14 percent
and for a HDPE pipe shall be 14 percent. Greater slopes may be
approved if installation is in accordance with manufacturer's
recommendations. In cases where the slope is in excess of 10
percent, anchor collars may be required.
d. A minimum pipe cover of one (1) foot shall be required.
9.9.3 Outlet Location - Culverts and Pipe Systems
a. Outlet structures (such as headwalls) shall not be located closer to
the project site's property line with an adjoining property than the
City of Suwanee Development Regulations
_________________________________________________________________
September 2, 2010 Revision Page 101
greater of the distance necessary to construct any velocity
protection or a flow distance equal to six (6) pipe diameters. For
non-circular conduits, this distance shall be six (6) times the rise
dimension of the conduit.
b. The invert elevation of a culvert or pipe outlet shall be no more than
2 feet above the elevation of the bottom of the receiving
watercourse at the outlet.
9.9.4 Energy Dissipation
The maximum developed condition flow velocity at the project site's
downstream property line with an adjoining tract shall not exceed the
maximum predeveloped condition velocity. Calculations may be required
to support this velocity standard on a case-by-case basis.
9.9.5 Discharge of Concentrated Flows
a. The discharge of concentrated flows of stormwater into public
roadways shall be avoided. In no case shall such concentrated
flows, including flows from swales, ditches, draws, driveways, or
piped systems, exceed the allowable peak flow rates in Table 9-G,
below.
TABLE 9-G
MAXIMUM FLOWS INTO STREETS
ALLOWABLE PEAK FLOW RATE
STREET CLASSIFICATION FOR A 2-YEAR STORM
Local 2.0 cfs
Minor Collector 1.0 cfs
Other 0.5 cfs
b. In residential subdivisions, the drainage area contributing to the
peak flow along any property line between lots within 50 feet of the
building setback line for either lot shall not exceed 2 acres, unless
contained within a piped drainage system or maintained in a
natural watercourse. The storm water conveyance shall be in a
drainage easement.

ARTICLE 11
PROCEDURES
11.1 SUBDIVISION REVIEW PROCEDURES
11.1.1 Pre-Application Conference
Whenever any subdivision of a tract of land is proposed to be made,
whether for residential or nonresidential development, the subdivider is
encouraged to present to the Department preliminary documents and
graphic exhibits to permit early evaluation of the subdivider's intentions and
coordination with the Comprehensive Plan, Zoning Ordinance, Metropolitan
River Protection Act, etc., and to inform and provide the subdivider with the
necessary regulations in order to properly accomplish the proposed project.
11.1.2 Concept Plan Approval
a. Application for Concept Plan approval shall be submitted to the City
using an application form and in a number of copies to be
determined by the Director. The Concept Plan shall include the
entire property proposed for development, but need not include the
applicant's entire contiguous ownership. The Concept Plan shall be
reviewed and approved by all affected City and County Departments.
b. In such case that the subdivider elects not to submit a Concept Plan,
then the subdivider may proceed directly with the submittal of
Development Plans if they show the entire property proposed for
development. In so doing, however, the subdivider assumes the risk
of premature design and engineering expenses in the event that the
City requires subsequent design and engineering changes.
c. Following Concept Plan approval, a clearing and grubbing permit
may be issued based on a Tree Protection Plan (if required - see
Tree Protection Ordinance) and soil erosion and sedimentation
control plan approved by the Department, and consistent with an
approved Certificate issued under the Metropolitan River Protection
Act, if applicable.
d. Copies of the approved Concept Plan shall be provided to the
Department for permanent record, in a number as determined by the
Director.

include the entire property being developed and having the same
zoning. The application shall include the Preliminary Plat, and
construction drawings. All construction drawings and other
engineering data shall be prepared and sealed by a Professional
Engineer or Landscape Architect currently registered in the State of
Georgia, in accordance with provisions of Georgia Law.
b. Following submission to the City of a Preliminary Plat and all
drawings required for development permit review, a grading permit
may be issued at the developers request based on a soil erosion
and sedimentation control plan, hydrology study, and related
construction drawings, and consistent with an approved Certificate
issued under the Metropolitan River Protection Act. The grading
permit shall be limited to the area included within the Development
Plans and may be further conditioned as deemed appropriate or
necessary pending development permit approval.
c. The Director shall indicate on a review copy of the drawings or in a
written memorandum all comments related to compliance of the
Development Plans with these Regulations, principles of good
design, the Zoning Ordinance, conditions of zoning approval, and the

State agencies as appropriate. The Director shall have final staff
authority to determine the applicability of any and all comments
under these Development Regulations, the Zoning Ordinance or
conditions of zoning approval.
d. The Director may not approve any Preliminary Plat whereon is
shown a lot which would present particularly unusual difficulties for
construction of a building, which would clearly require a variance to
be reasonably usable, or which is otherwise "unbuildable" because
of its unusability, whether due to the presence of floodplain, unusual
configuration, lack of public utilities or for any other reason. A House
City of Suwanee Development Regulations
_________________________________________________________________

must be read in its entirety to fully understand where specific land uses are permitted
within this zoning district. Some permitted uses require approval as a special use when

A. PERMITTED USES.
Within the C-3 Zoning District, the following uses shall be permitted.
1.. Accessory Buildings, Structures and Uses in accordance with the
provisions set forth in Section 604 of this Ordinance.
2. Adult Entertainment Facilities, provided1:
1 The City of Suwanee finds that the regulation of the location of certain adult establishments is necessary to
promote and protect the public health, safety, and general welfare of the City as said establishments, have been shown to
exhibit detrimental secondary effects which would yield them inappropriate in certain zoning classifications and adjacent to
or near certain institutions.
The City takes official notice of certain studies which have illustrated harmful secondary negative effects of adult
establishments/sexually oriented businesses including increased crime, decreased property values, increased blight, and
increased law enforcement expenditures. The City Council has reviewed documentary evidence and studies in other
jurisdictions including Gwinnett County, Georgia; Rome, Georgia; and other communities throughout the United States
including thirty-two communities set forth in the National Law Center for Children and Families Study and incorporates each
study as if fully set forth herein.
The City Council takes particular note of the findings and public hearing process of Gwinnett County, Georgia in
that the City of Suwanee is located in said County and exhibits similar demographics. Specifically, the City Council adopts
and incorporates by reference the proceedings and testimony of the public hearing on July 17, 2001 before the Gwinnett
County Board of Commissioners.
The City also recognizes the right of speech grounded in the Georgia and U. S. Constitution and the manifestation
of such through adult/sexually oriented businesses and the products and services they render. The City does not seek to
prohibit this protected form of speech. In seeking to protect this right the City finds the regulations set forth herein are the
least restrictive means available in balancing this right while furthering the substantial governmental interests set forth above
in curtailing the harmful secondary effects of this speech.
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 64

SECTION 510. PMUD Planned Mixed-Use District.
A PURPOSE
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 79
The purpose of this district is to provide for appropriate planned development of quality
mixed-use projects within the City of Suwanee by allowing greater freedom of design,
by improving the opportunity for flexibility and creativity in the land development
process, by undertaking techniques which foster community and pedestrianism, and by
limiting the expenditure of public funds in an effort to achieve the objectives and intent
of the Citys Comprehensive Plan.
Specifically, this district is intended to:
A. Allow diversification of uses, structures, densities and open spaces when
not in conflict with existing and permitted land uses on abutting properties.
B. Reduce development costs through a more efficient use of land and a
smaller network of utilities and streets than is possible through the
application of standards contained in conventional land development
regulations.
C. Conserve the natural amenities of the land by encouraging the
preservation of environmentally significant, scenic and functional open
space.
D. Provide maximum opportunity for the application of innovative site
planning concepts through the creation of aesthetically pleasing
environments for living, shopping, and working on properties of adequate
size, shape and location.
E. Insure that development will occur according to the advantages and
limitations of land, site design, population density, building coverage,
improvement standards, and construction phasing as authorized through
the approval of a comprehensive site development plan.
F. Provide a mechanism to incorporate and implement the goals and intent of
the City of Suwanee Comprehensive Plan.
G. Encourage pedestrianism and transportation alternatives.
This District is not intended to increase overall density or development intensity on a
particular property except in relation to an improved design and benefit to the public.
The use of open space, public meeting areas, and recreational uses should be included
as part of any project. This District is intended to provide a vehicle for improved
development through creative design and appropriate mixtures of land uses.
There are two variations of the Planned Mixed-Use District; Mixed-Use Village and
Mixed-Use Center. The Citys Comprehensive Plan should be consulted to determine
when and where each of these variations may be appropriate.
B. MINIMUM DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
A. Consistency with Comprehensive Plan.
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 80
All projects must be reasonably consistent with the goals and intents of the City of
Suwanee Comprehensive Plan.
B. Variations to Development Standards.
Variations to local development standards (i.e. Development and Zoning Regulations),
including variations in lot sizes, widths, building setbacks, densities, parking
requirements, right-of-way widths, street widths, buffers, and other components may be
approved to improve said project. Any variation to an adopted regulation or requirement
must be expressly submitted and reviewed as part of an overall plan. All Variations
must be included in a List of Standards agreed to and accepted by the City.
The City will not consider Variations to standards or regulations of other regulating
jurisdictions, such as erosion control regulations, fire codes, floodplain control, stream
buffers, or other similar regulations, without the express written consent and approval of
applicable jurisdiction. Furthermore, said consent shall not guarantee nor require the
City to waive any or all requirements.
C. Design Requirements.
All projects should incorporate traditional neighborhood design principles.
Interconnectivity, pedestrianism, good design, architectural detail, and appropriate scale
are essential elements. Where appropriate, separate land uses are encouraged to be
integrated both horizontally and vertically.
At a minimum all projects shall include and/or incorporate the following components:
A. All Planned Mixed-Use development projects must have a minimum of two
discrete type of land use (commercial and single-family, industrial and
multi-family, etc.).
B. All projects must have a professionally prepared Master Plan for the entire
project. It must be designed and incorporated together to provide a
harmonious transition from one use to another. Common architecture,
themes, significant natural features, connectivity and other items must be
included.
C. A functional town center, community green, park, or other focal point must
be included to create character and identity.
D. Interconnections to adjoining property, whether developed or
undeveloped, should be included and incorporated into the design where
appropriate.
E. All projects should have adequate and appropriate access.
F. Other standards, as outlined in the City of Suwanee Comprehensive Plan
Design Guidelines, which are appropriate for the sites specific location
and character area should be included.
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 81
When determining the appropriateness and viability of a proposed project, the City shall
consult the City of Suwanee Comprehensive Plan. Projects that prove that the use of
innovative or creative design will benefit the City may be considered for said district.
C. USES PERMITTED
A. Planned Mixed-Use Village
Planned Mixed-Use Villages shall be primarily residential in character and may include
a mixture of single-family and multi-family residential uses. Overall residential density
shall be limited to no more than 8 units per acre. Lower densities may be required by

Supplemental nonresidential uses (office and limited retail) are permitted when
complementary to and compatible with the orderly operation of the residential project,
provided that all such uses shall not constitute more than twenty (20) percent of the total
project land area or gross floor area, whichever is less, or as otherwise permitted by the
City Council.
Residential uses may be attached, semi-attached, detached and/or located within multistory
buildings above non-residential office or commercial development.
Mixed-Use Villages shall be designed using the adopted Comprehensive Plan Design
Guidelines adopted by the City of Suwanee. Favorable projects will incorporate most, if
not all, of these standards.
All projects shall incorporate good design and engineering principles.
B. Planned Mixed-Use Center
Planned Mixed-Use Centers shall be primarily non-residential in character and may
include a mixture of office, commercial and industrial uses.
Supplemental residential uses may also be permitted when complementary to and
compatible with the orderly development of the planned project; provided that all such
residential uses shall not exceed the net density in excess of what the least restrictive
conventional residential zoning would permit or that density outlined by the Citys
Comprehensive Plan, whichever is greater. Lower residential densities may be required
by the City Council if adjacent to lower density residential areas, or where otherwise
appropriate.
All projects shall incorporate good design and engineering principles.

Section 511. CSO Conservation Subdivision Overlay District.
A. Purposes.
The purposes of this overlay district are as follows:
1. To provide a residential zoning district that permits flexibility of subdivision design
in order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land. A
district that permits clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally
sensitive soils that will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved
surfaces and utility easements, necessary for residential development.
2. To encourage the development of residential communities, that are density
neutral based on standard zoning and development standards, but designed to
preserve and protect environmental resources, scenic vistas, and natural and
cultivated landscapes.
3. To enhance land, water, air and tree resources by minimizing the area of land
disturbance, reducing impervious surface, optimizing stream buffers, preserving
tree cover and encouraging the provision of open space.
4. To reduce infrastructure maintenance costs due to efficient community design.
5. To provide open space and pedestrian linkages and wildlife corridors among
residential communities and to encourage recreation opportunities.
6. To preserve significant historical and archeological features.
7. To preserve and protect contiguous undeveloped areas within the development.
8. To preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as
groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodland and wildlife
habitat.
B. General Standards.
1. Applicability. This overlay district may be overlaid only upon the City of Suwanee

SECTION 512. Old Town Overlay District (OTOD)
A. PURPOSE AND INTENT.
The City of Suwanee has adopted certain policies covering appropriate uses and
development standards for the historic Old Town area of Suwanee. The City finds that
the area is suitable for uses and development patterns customarily found in small
downtown areas throughout Georgia. Some of these development patterns require
different zoning restrictions and uses than typically contained in suburban zoning
regulations. In an effort to allow traditional forms and densities, different zoning
standards are necessary for this specific area.
The Old Town Overlay District (OTOD) is intended to regulate building and site design
in the Old Town area. The regulations are intended to create a comfortable and uniform
pedestrian/public space between roadways and buildings providing for a traditional
building relationship. The regulations address standards for the pedestrian space,
build-to lines for buildings, building massing, site access off of roadways, open space,
parking, landscaping and other related elements.
B. DISTRICT ESTABLISHED AND APPLICABILITY.
The Old Town Overlay District is hereby established and shall generally follow the
established boundary of the City of Suwanee Downtown Development Authority with the
addition of related adjoining property. The map depicting the boundary of the Old Town
Overlay District is attached and hereby made a part of this Ordinance and shall be
known as "The Official Old Town Overlay District Boundary Map." Where a District
boundary line is shown as approximately following a corporate limits line, the center line
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 95
of a street, road, creek, or property line, or such lines extended, then such lines shall be
construed to be the District boundary lines.
Within the Old Town Overlay District, all new non-residential and mixed-use
development and parcels within new subdivisions that exceed five (5) parcels, shall
comply with applicable rules and regulations contained herein which shall take
precedence to any other conflicting zoning or development standards. The Old Town
Overlay District also establishes two zoning districts allowable only within the overlay
district boundaries.
C. GRANDFATHERING.
Any project for which a valid and complete application for a Land Disturbance Permit shall
have been received prior to the effective date of these Regulations, or shown on an
concept plan previously approved by the City of Suwanee City Council, shall be
considered "grandfathered" and, at the developer's option, may proceed to completion and
building permits may be issued under existing regulations in place prior to the effective
date of these Regulations, provided that the Development Permit is or can be issued
within 12 months of said effective date and all time frames associated with said permit are
observed.
D. ROAD CLASSIFICATION MAP AND STANDARD DRAWINGS.
Every public road within the Old Town Overlay District shall be classified as an access
road, commercial street, enhanced old town street, urban parkway, suburban parkway,
or local street for the purpose of regulating under this section. The map depicting the
road classification is attached and hereby made a part of this Ordinance, and shall be
known as The Official Old Town Overlay District Road Classification Map. The map
may be amended from time to time by the Suwanee City Council.
A set of Standard Sidewalk Area Drawings shall be created and maintained by the City
of Suwanee Planning and Community Development Department. Said standards shall
provide a regulatory basis for the composition and dimensions of the sidewalk area and
building location based on site conditions. Appeals or deviations from the Standard
Drawing shall be made to the Suwanee Zoning Board of Appeals through city variance
procedures.
E. DEFINITIONS.
1. Build-to Line. The build-to line is the line along which the building street façade is
permitted to be located. The distance between the build-to line and the nearest
street curb is equal to the sidewalk area width requirements, except where public
or private open space is adjacent to the sidewalk area, the build-to line shall
extend around the perimeter of such opens space. Requirements include the
minimum street façade frontage of principal structures.
2. Sidewalk Area. The area beginning at the edge of asphalt (or street curb, as
appropriate) and consisting of a contiguous landscape zone, clear zone, and
supplemental zone including intervening driveways.

SECTION 513. Gwinnett County-Annexed (GC-A)
A. ESTABLISHMENT AND APPLICATION.
The Gwinnett County-Annexed (GC-A) zoning district is used for certain properties
annexed from unincorporated Gwinnett County into the city limits of the City of Suwanee
to maintain regulatory continuity and legal status.
B. REGULATIONS OF LANDS IN THE GC-A ZONING DISTRICT.
Any property zoned Gwinnett County-Annexed (GC-A) as shown on the Official Zoning
Map, unless otherwise specifically approved by the Suwanee, shall be subject to the
zoning standards and property-specific conditions of zoning or special use approval, or
both, adopted by the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners by resolution which
applied to said properties at the time they were zoned, or the special use was permitted,
in unincorporated Gwinnett County immediately prior to annexation. Copies of the
contents of the official Gwinnett County zoning and special use permit files of properties
so annexed shall become official files of the City of Suwanee and shall be maintained
by the Director, and said conditions of zoning or special use approval, or both, adopted
by the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners as adopted and applied by the City of
Suwanee, shall constitute the zoning regulations governing said properties.
C. Development of Properties in the GC-A Zoning District.
Properties in the GC-A district shall continue to enjoy the use or uses specifically
conferred by formal zoning or special use permit action of the Gwinnett County Board of
Commissioners immediately prior to annexation. Development of any properties zoned
GC-A on the effective date of this zoning ordinance shall comply with the following:
1. The property-specific conditions of zoning adopted by the Gwinnett
County Board of Commissioners in a property-specific rezoning action by
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 107
resolution and which were in effect for said property when in
unincorporated Gwinnett County immediately prior to annexation.
2. The property-specific conditions of special use approval adopted by the
Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners in a property-specific special
use permit action by resolution and which were in effect for said property
when in unincorporated Gwinnett County immediately prior to annexation.
3. Any property-specific variances granted by the Gwinnett County Board of
Zoning Appeals and which are a part of the official Gwinnett County files
for said property on record with the Director.
4. Any property-specific modifications of zoning or special use permit
conditions approved by the City of Suwanee through formal action at a
regular meeting prior to the effective date of this zoning ordinance, on
record with the City Clerk.
5. In reviewing a development proposal for compliance with the zoning
regulations of the GC-A zoning district, questions may arise as to what
other additional dimensional requirements or use regulations apply. In
certain cases the Director may not be able to resolve such questions by
relying on the zoning or special use permit conditions and any applicable
variances or modifications of said conditions alone. For example, a
building on a site plan approved as a condition of zoning or special use
permit approval may not be shown with enough specificity to determine
the maximum building height or setbacks that apply to the proposed
building. Or, questions may arise as to whether the use provisions allow
for an accessory building, structure, or use on the subject property that is
not shown on the site plan approved as a condition. In such instances
where questions about development permissions cannot be resolved by
applying the above provisions 1 through 4 of this section, the Director shall
apply regulations of the Suwanee zoning district established in Article V of
this zoning ordinance which most closely resembles the zoning district of
Gwinnett Countys Zoning Resolution which applied to the property
immediately prior to annexation, as more particularly shown in Table 8.1.1:
Gwinnett County  Suwanee Zoning District Conversion Based on Permitted
Uses and Density (each row indicates compatible zoning districts).
Gwinnett County District Suwanee Zoning District standards
which shall apply when questions
arise under the terms of this Section
as they related to dimensional
requirements and accessory buildings,
structures, and uses.

D. Remedies for Additional Development Permission
1. In any case where a development is proposed on property zoned GC-A
but such development would not be consistent with the provisions of the
GC-A zoning district as specified in this Section, there shall be the
following possible remedies:
a. File an application to rezone the property from GC-A to another zoning
district set forth in Article V of this zoning ordinance that lawfully provides
for the proposed development, in accordance with applicable zoning
procedures and Article XXI of this zoning ordinance.
b. The Director may authorize that a variance application be made to the
Suwanee Board of Zoning Appeals, in accordance with the provisions of
Article XX of this zoning ordinance, but only on an individual, case-bycase
basis and only involving a single building that cannot meet the yard
area, setbacks, buffers, landscape strips, building coverage, or other
dimensional (numeric) requirements of the approved site plan and
conditions of zoning. No application for a variance shall be filed, accepted,
or processed that contains a request to vary dimensional requirements
pertaining to more than one principal building; provided, however, that an
applicant may file more than one variance application when more than one
building is involved. Such applications, if approved by the Director to be
filed, shall be processed in accordance with applications for variances as
specified in this zoning ordinance.
c. The Chairman of the Zoning Board of Appeals is authorized to grant
administrative variances to properties zoned GC-A, pursuant to and as
specified in Section 2102 of this zoning ordinance.
2. Minor revisions to an approved site plan or development plan may be
administratively approved by the Director if in the Directors judgment such
changes: (1) do not involve an increase in density or intensity of the site;
and (2) do not alter buffers or setbacks along perimeter boundaries; and
(3) do not otherwise result in a change that would be contrary to the public
interest or that would be better considered via a public hearing process
and a change in zoning or special use approval.
E. Compliance.
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 109

municipal limits of the City of Suwanee between 1998 and the effective date of this
zoning ordinance shall be subject to all applicable procedural and substantive
requirements of this zoning ordinance as now or hereafter amended.
F. Assumption of Administrative Functions.

the GC-A zoning district require an administrative determination or decision,
interpretation, or other administrative action, the Director shall have the authority to
make such administrative determination, decision, or interpretation. To this end, the
Director shall assume the authority of all administrative officials referred to in said
conditions of zoning approval by Gwinnett County; provided, however, that in cases
where engineering considerations are specified, the City Engineer shall have such

SECTION 804. General Requirements
804.1. The requirements set forth in this Section shall govern the location and
construction of all towers and the installation of all antennas governed by this Article.
A. Building Codes: Safety Standards
To ensure the structural integrity of communication towers, the owner of a tower
shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in
applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for towers that are
published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to
time. Tower owners shall conduct periodic inspections of communication towers
at least once every two years to ensure structural integrity. Inspections shall be
conducted by a structural engineer licensed to practice in Georgia. The results
of such inspection shall be provided to the City Administrator. The owner shall
have thirty (30) days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If
the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within said thirty (30) days,
the governing authority may remove such tower at the owner's expense.
B. Regulatory Compliance
1. All towers and antennas must meet or exceed current standards and
regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or
federal government with the authority to regulate communications towers
and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed then the
owners of the communications towers and antennas governed by this
Article shall bring such communications towers and antennas into
compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6)
months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a
more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal
agency.
2. Tower owners shall provide documentation showing that each
communication tower is in compliance with all federal requirements.
Evidence of compliance must be submitted every 12 months.
3. Tower owners shall register ownership annually with the City and
ownership changes with the City within thirty (30) days of any change.
4. The tower owner must file with the City a letter of intent for use every
twenty-four (24) months and provide the City with a copy of any notice to
the FCC of intent to cease operations within sixty (60) days of the date
planned to cease.
C. Security
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 124
Communication towers shall be enclosed by virtually pleasing, decay-resistant
security fencing not less than six (6) feet in height and shall be equipped with an
appropriate anti-climbing device; provided, however, the City Administrator or the
Governing Body may waive such requirements for alternative tower structures.
D. Lighting
No illumination is permitted on an antenna or tower unless required by the FCC,
FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction in which case the
City Administrator may review the available lighting alternatives and approve the
design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views.
E. Advertising
No advertising is permitted on an antenna or tower. No signs, verbiage,
symbols, or information of any kind is permitted on an antenna or tower.
F. Visual Impact
1. Non-camouflaged towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or,
subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other applicable federal
or state agency, be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual
obtrusiveness.
2. At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to
the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and
landscaping that will blend the tower facilities to the natural setting and
build environment. Tower applicants are strongly encouraged to
camouflage towers, such as by designing as a tree type appropriate to the
area.
3. Any tower applicant that is not proposing a camouflage tower must
provide a detailed explanation why they are not proposing a camouflaged
tower. Explanation must discuss items other than economics.
4. If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna
and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral
color that is identical to, or closely compatible with, the color of the
supporting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as
visually unobtrusive as possible.
5. Towers clustered at the same site shall be of similar design and scale.
6. Towers shall be the minimum height necessary to provide parity with
existing similar tower supported antenna, and shall be freestanding where
the negative visual effect is less than would be created by use of a guyed
tower.
G. Landscaping
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 125
Landscaping shall be used to effectively screen the view of the tower compound
from adjacent public ways, public property and residential property and shall be
as follows:
1. Tower facilities shall be landscaped with a landscaped strip of plant
materials, which effectively screens the view of the tower compound.
Landscaped strips shall be a minimum of fifteen (15) feet in width and
located outside the fenced perimeter of the compound. Landscaped strips
shall satisfy the minimum design and planting requirements for buffers
established in the Article XVII. Buffer, Landscape and Tree Regulations.
2. All existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be
preserved. Where natural vegetation around the perimeter of the site
would provide an adequate visual screen, an undisturbed buffer may be
utilized.
3. Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practical
extent. The applicant shall provide a site plan showing existing significant
vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that
lost.
4. In lieu of these standards, the City Administrator may allow use of an
alternate detailed plan and specifications for landscape and screening,
including plantings, fences, walls and other features designed to screen
and buffer towers and accessory uses. The plan shall accomplish the
same degree of screening achieved by the provisions above, except as
lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security
purposes and/or for continued operation of existing bona fide agricultural
or forest uses such as farms, nurseries, and tree farms. In certain
locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, such as
remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas,
the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived via written
permission from the City Council.
H. Maintenance Impacts.
Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent
possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access
from a collector and local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be
exclusively by means of the collector street.
I. Principal, Accessory and Joint Uses
1. Accessory structures used in direct support of a tower shall be allowed but
not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile
or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a tower facility shall
not be stored or parked on the site of the tower, unless repairs to the
tower are being made.
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 126
2. Towers may be located on sites containing another principal use in the
same buildable area. As long as all of the other siting, setback, separation
and general requirements of this Article are met, towers may occupy a
parcel meeting the minimum lot size requirements for the zoning district in
which it is located. The minimum distance between a tower and other
principal use located on the same lot shall be the greater of one hundred
(100%) of the breakpoint or twenty-five (25) feet for a monopole, lattice or
guy tower. This separation is required to assure compatibility of land uses
and to provide for the health, safety and welfare of individuals and
structures occupying the same site.
3. Joint use of a site is prohibited when a proposed or existing principal use
includes the storage, distribution or sale of volatile, flammable, explosive
or hazardous materials such as propane, gasoline, natural gas and
dangerous chemicals.
J. Tower lot size, setbacks and separation
1. The site shall be of a size and shape sufficient to provide an adequate
setback from the base of the tower to any property line abutting a
residential district, public property, or public street. Such setback shall be
sufficient to:
a. Provide for an adequate vegetative, topographic or other buffer
as required in Section 804.1. (F) and (G);
b. Preserve the privacy of surrounding residential property;
c. Protect adjoining property from the potential impact of tower
failure by being large enough to accommodate such failure on the
site, based on the engineer's analysis required in this Article.
2. A site is presumed to be of sufficient size when it:
a. Meets the requirements of the above subsection (1);
b. Provides a setback equal to the greater of two times the height
of the tower failure or the height of the actual tower by being large
enough to accommodate such failure on the site, based on the
engineer's analysis required in this Article.
c. Provides a setback equal to or exceeding the rear yard setback
required for the adjoining property where the adjoining property is
not in a residential district nor a public property nor a public street,
as long as the setback of the adjoining property is at least 100% of
the breakpoint of the tower.
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 127
3. Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all
setback, design and landscape requirements are met as to each tower.
Structure may be located as close to each other as technically feasible,
provided tower failure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead
to multiple failures in the event that one fails.
4. For a guyed structure, the site shall be of a size and shape sufficient to
provide a setback equal to at least the height of the tower from a guy
anchor to any property line abutting a residential district, public property or
public street in addition to the size required to comply with subsection (2)
above. Such setback shall be adequate to provide a vegetative,
topographic or other buffer sufficient to obscure view to the anchor from
such adjoining properties.
5. All structures and uses associated with the transmission use other than
the transmission tower shall be located to meet the setbacks required in
the zoning district where the tower is to be located.
SECTION 805. Shared Use
805.1. All new towers shall be designed to structurally accommodate the maximum
number of additional users technically practicable.
A. Once a new tower is approved, additional antennas and accompanying
accessory uses may be added to it in accordance with the approved share plan if
the City Administrator finds that the standards of this Article are met.
B. For a new tower to be approved, the owner shall be required as conditions of
approval, to:
1. Record the letter of intent to include a project contact and a brief
description of the site where the tower is located at the City of Suwanee in
the office of the City Clerk.
2. Respond in a timely, comprehensive manner to a request for information
from a potential shared use applicant;
3. Negotiate in good faith for shared use by third parties; and
4. Allow shared use where the third party seeking such agrees in writing to
pay reasonable, pro rata charges for sharing, including all charges
necessary to modify the tower and transmitters to accommodate shared
use, but not total tower reconstruction, and to observe whatever technical
requirements are necessary to allow shared use without creating
interference.
C. Willful, knowing failure of an owner whose tower was approved after the effective
date of this Article to comply with the requirement of (1) through (4) above shall
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 128
be grounds for withholding approval of any application by such owner for a
building permit or Tall Structure Permit for any tower or antenna.
D. Applicant and all subsequent users of any telecommunication tower located in
Suwanee shall comply with Part 77 of the Federal Aviation Regulations. Passage
of this Article shall also include adoption of part 77 of the Federal Aviation
Regulations. All placement of towers and antennas must be approved by the
FAA before a building permit or placement is allowed. This approval is generally
granted by the successful completion of FAA Form 7480-1 or its equivalent.
E. Such conditions shall run with the land and be binding on subsequent purchasers
of the tower site.
SECTION 806. Application Procedures
806.1. Application for a development permit for any communication tower or use of an
alternative tower structure shall be made to the City Administrator. An application will
not be considered until it is complete. A complete application must contain the
following:
A. Inventory of Existing Sites: An inventory of the applicant's existing towers that are
either within the jurisdiction of the governing authority or within two miles of the
border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and
design of each tower.
B. Site plan or plans to scale specifying the location of tower(s), guy anchors (if
any), transmission building and/or other accessory uses, access, fences,
landscaped areas, and adjacent land uses.
C. Landscape plan to scale indicating size, spacing and type of plantings required in
Section 804.1.G.

lines impacting the proposed tower site.
E. A Phase I Environmental Site Assessment & Environmental Impact
Study/Statement fully describing the effect that the proposed tower and/or
antenna will have on the environment and surrounding area, impacts on adjacent
residential structures and districts, impacts on structures and sites of historic
significance and impacts on streetscapes. The required report shall fully
described the potential environmental concerns associated with past or current
site or surrounding land use.
F. A certified statement prepared by an engineer licensed to practice in Georgia that
the construction of the tower, including reception and transmission functions, will
not interfere with the usual and customary transmission or reception of radio,
television, etc., service enjoyed by adjacent properties.
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 129
G. A description of anticipated maintenance needs, including frequency of service,
personnel needs, equipment needs, and traffic, noise or safety impacts of such
maintenance.
H. Report from a professional structural engineer licensed in the State of Georgia,
documenting the following:
1. Tower height and design, including technical, engineering, economic, and
other pertinent factors governing selection of the proposed design. A
cross-section of the tower structure shall be included.
2. Total anticipated capacity of the structure, including number and types of
antennas which can be accommodated.
3. Evidence of structural integrity of the tower structure.
4. Failure characteristics of the tower and demonstration that site and
setbacks are of adequate size to contain debris.
I. Written statements from the FAA, FCC and any appropriate state review
authority stating that the proposed tower complies with regulations administered
by that agency or that the tower is exempt from those regulations.
J. Letter of intent to lease excess space on the tower structure and to lease
additional excess land on the tower site when the shared use potential of the
tower is absorbed, if structurally and technically possible.
K. A reasonable pro rata charge may be made for shared use, consistent with an
appropriate sharing of construction, financing and maintenance costs. Fees may
also be charged for any structural or RF changes necessitated by such shared
use. Such sharing shall be a condition for approval.
1. The applicant shall describe what range of charges are reasonably
expected to be assessed against shared users.
2. The applicant shall base charges on Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP) and shall explain the elements included in the charge.
L. The applicant shall quantify the additional tower capacity anticipated, including
the approximate number and types of antennas. The applicant shall also
describe any limitations on the ability of the tower to accommodate other uses,
e.g., radio frequency interference, mass height, frequency or other
characteristics. The applicant shall describe the technical options available to
overcome those limitations and reasons why the technical options considered
were not chosen to be incorporated. The City Administrator shall approve those
limitations if they cannot be overcome by reasonable technical means.
M. Evidence of the lack of space on all suitable existing towers and alternative tower
structures to locate the proposed antenna and of the lack of space on existing
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 130
tower sites and alternative tower structures to construct a tower for the proposed
antenna.
N. Each applicant must make a good faith effort to substantially demonstrate that no
existing or proposed towers can accommodate the applicant's proposed
antenna/transmitter as described below:
1. The applicant shall contact the owners of all existing or planned towers of
a height roughly equal to or greater than the height of the tower proposed
by the applicant. A list shall be provided of all owners contacted, the date
of such contact, and the form and content of such contact.
2. Such contact shall be made in a timely manner; that is, sufficiently before
the filing of an application for a building permit to include a response into
the application when filed.
a. Failure of a listed owner to respond shall not be relevant if a
timely, good faith effort was made to obtain one. However, where
an existing or planned tower is known to have capacity for
additional antennas of the sort proposed, based on the decision
regarding such tower, that application for a new tower shall not be
complete until the owner of the existing or planned tower responds.
Such response is to be required as a condition of approval.
b. The City Administrator shall maintain and provide, on request,
records of responses from each tower owner.
c. Once an owner demonstrates an antenna of the sort proposed
by the applicant cannot be accommodated on the owner's tower as
described below, the owner need not be contacted by future
applicants for antennas of the sort proposed.
3. The applicant shall request the following information from each tower
owner contacted:
a. Identification of the site by location, tax lot number, existing
uses, and tower height.
b. Whether each such tower could structurally accommodate the
antenna proposed by the applicant without requiring structural
changes be made to the tower. To enable the owner to respond,
the applicant shall provide each such owner with the height, length,
weight, and other relevant data about the proposed antenna.
c. Whether each such tower could structurally accommodate the
proposed antenna, if structural changes were made, not including
totally rebuilding the tower. If so, the owner shall specify in general
terms what structural changes would be required.
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 131
d. If structurally able, would shared use of such existing tower be
precluded for reasons related to RF interference. If so, the owner
shall describe in general terms what changes in either the existing
or proposed antenna would be required to accommodate the
proposed tower, if at all.
e. If shared use is possible, the fee an owner of an existing tower
would charge for such shared use.
4. Shared use is not precluded simply because a reasonable fee for shared
use is charged, or because of reasonable costs necessary to adapt the
existing and proposed uses to a shared tower. The City Administrator and
the Governing Body may consider expert testimony to determine whether
the fee and costs are reasonable. Costs exceeding new tower
development are presumed unreasonable.
O. Applicant shall supply a site specific description and artistic renderings depicting
how the tower will be camouflaged at the time of construction completion
(camouflage will be consistent with existing vegetation and terrain) to overcome
negative visual impact on non-industrial and residential areas.
P. Any other information which may be requested by the City Administrator to fully
evaluate and review the application and the potential impact of a proposed tower
and/or antenna.
SECTION 807. Appeals
A. Appeals from any decision of the City Administrator and/or the Planning and
Zoning Commission shall be to the Suwanee City Council within 10 days of
receipt of the decision. Any appeal of a decision of the Suwanee City Council
shall be made to the Suwanee Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals within 10
days pursuant to Article XIV. Appeals from any decision of the Board of Appeals
shall be made to the Superior Court of Gwinnett County within 30 days of the
decision.
B. All appeals shall be in writing and must be supported by substantial evidence in a
written record.
SECTION 808. Removal of Antennas and Towers
All towers and antennas shall be maintained in compliance with standards contained in
applicable building and technical codes so as to ensure the structural integrity of such
towers. If upon inspection by the City Administrator such tower is determined not to
comply with the code standards or to constitute a danger to persons or property, then
upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower and the owner of the property if
such owner is different, such owners shall have thirty (30) days to bring such tower into
compliance. In the event such tower or antenna is not brought into compliance within
thirty (30) days, the City may provide notice to the owners requiring the tower or
antenna to be removed. In the event such tower or antenna is not removed within (30)
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 132
days of receipt of such notice, the City may remove such tower or antenna and place a
lien upon the property for the costs of removal. Delay by the City in taking action shall
not in any way waive the City's right to take action. The City may pursue all legal
remedies available to it to insure that communication towers and antenna not in
compliance with the code standards or which constitute danger to persons or property
are brought into compliance or removed. The City may seek to have the tower or
antenna removed regardless of the owners' or operator's intent to operate the tower or
antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have
been granted.
SECTION 809. Abandoned Towers
A. Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of twelve (12)
months shall be considered abandoned, whether or not the owner or operator
intends to make use of the tower. The owner of an abandoned antenna or tower
and the owner of the property where the tower is located shall be under a duty to
remove such a tower or antenna. If such antenna and/or tower is not removed
within sixty (60) days of receipt of notice from the City notifying the owner(s) of
such abandonment, the City may remove such tower and/or antenna and
accessory building and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal.
The City may pursue all legal remedies available to it to insure that abandoned
communication towers and antenna are removed. Delay by the City in taking
action shall not in any way waive the City's right to take action. The City may
seek to have the communication tower or antenna removed regardless of the
owners' or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of
any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted.
B. If the owner of an abandoned tower or antenna wishes to use such abandoned
tower or antenna, the owner first must apply for and receive all applicable permits
and meet all of the conditions of this Article as if such tower or antenna were a
new tower or antenna.
SECTION 810. Pre-Existing Towers/Non-Conforming Uses
All communications towers operative on March 17, 1998 shall be allowed to continue
their present usage as a non-conforming use in accordance with Section 1300 of the
City of Suwanee Zoning Article. Routine maintenance, including replacement with a new
tower of identical construction and height, shall be permitted on such existing towers.
All new construction other than routine maintenance on an existing communication
tower shall comply with the requirements of this ordinance.
SECTION 811. Severability.
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this Article is for any
reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, such
portion shall be deemed a separate, distinct and independent provision and such
holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions hereof.

ARTICLE IX
CHATTAHOOCHEE RIVER DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS
SECTION 900. Chattahoochee River Corridor Protection Area.
A. River Corridor Defined.
The Chattahoochee River Corridor shall extend for a horizontal distance of 2,000
feet from the edge of the Chattahoochee River, and any impoundment thereon,
as specifically defined in the Metropolitan River Protection Act of the State of
Georgia, as amended from time to time.
B. Activities Controlled.
All construction and development activities, clearance, land disturbance,
landscaping, occupancy and use of lands within the Chattahoochee River
Corridor shall be undertaken in conformance to the provisions of the Georgia
Metropolitan River Protection Act, the River Corridor Plan and applicable rules
and regulations as adopted by the Atlanta Regional Commission, and any
applicable certificate or permit issued pursuant to approval of a River Corridor
Application by the Mayor and Council.
C. River Corridor Application Approval Required.
Prior to initiating any activity on lands within the Chattahoochee River Corridor
which is controlled by the Metropolitan River Protection Act, and as a prerequisite
for issuance of any Clearing, Grading or Development or Building Permit for such
activity, a River Corridor Application must be filed with the City Clerk and
approved by the Mayor and Council pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
Atlanta Regional Commission. All such activities shall be carried out in strict
compliance with the provisions of the approved River Corridor Application and
any permits or certificates issued pursuant thereto.
SECTION 901. Chattahoochee River Tributary Protection Area.
This section of the Zoning Ordinance is adopted pursuant to the requirements of the
Official Code of Georgia, Annotated, Section 12-5-453.
A. Findings.
The City finds that:
1. The Chattahoochee River provides multiple benefits, which includes use
of the river as the primary water supply for metropolitan Atlanta.
2. The water quality of the Chattahoochee River depends upon the water
quality of the flowing streams tributary to the river.
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 135
3. Sediment and other polluting materials and conditions, including but not
limited to pesticides, nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, toxic
materials, and elevations in water temperatures are harmful to the water
quality of the river and its tributaries.
4. The riparian vegetation along these watercourses helps preserve water
quality. Dense tree growth helps to prevent stream bank erosion, and
streamside vegetation reduces the amount of sediment and other polluting
materials that would otherwise wash into streams. Riparian trees, by
shading, help maintain cooler water temperatures and thus enhance water
quality.
B. Purpose.
The purpose of this protection area is as follows:
1. Promote health, safety, and general welfare; to minimize public and
private losses due to erosion, siltation and water pollution.
2. Create vegetative buffer areas and adjacent to tributary streams in the
drainage basin of the Chattahoochee River.
C. Tributary Protection Area Development Standards.
1. Definition.
This protection area means the stream channel and the land area
extending outward 35 horizontal feet from the banks on either side of all
flowing streams in the drainage basins of all tributaries of the
Chattahoochee River located in the City of Suwanee. A flowing stream is
defined for the purpose of this Section as any stream that is portrayed on
the most current United States Geological Survey 7.5 minute quadrangle
as a perennial stream which has a drainage area of at least 320 acres.
2. Buffer.
A 15 foot natural buffer adjacent to the stream bank of said area is to
remain.
3. Building Setback.
A 35 foot building setback adjacent to the stream bank is to be provided.
(This is not a change in the minimum required yards nor permission to
build in a Flood Hazard.)
4. Buffer and Building Setback To Be Shown on Plats.
The buffer zone and building setback must be shown on Final Subdivision
Plats, as well as commercial, industrial and multi-family site plans.
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 136
D. Permit Required.
No person shall engage in any land disturbing activity within the protection area
without having obtained a Development Permit or Building Permit from the City.
No permit will be issued for any land disturbing activity within the protection area
unless the land disturbing activity is for the purpose of constructing one of the
following:
1. A stream crossing by a driveway, transportation route, or a public utility
including sanitary sewer lines.
2. The construction of public utilities including sanitary sewer lines.
3. A dam and/or impoundment, a detention, retention or sediment control
pond or facility.
E. Exemptions.
The provisions of this section shall not apply to:
1. Any public agency or its contractor.
2. Any person performing work within a right-of-way of any public agency
pursuant to a permit issued by such public agency.
3. Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property provided a written
factual report is presented to the City Clerk within 10 days.
4. Any development which has received a Development Permit prior to the
adoption of this Article or January 1, 1984, whichever is earlier.
5. Any work consisting of the operation, repair or maintenance of any lawful
use of land existing on the date of adoption of this Article or January 1,
1984, whichever is earlier.

approved or conditionally approved by the Director if the following provisions are met by
the applicant.
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 152

granting a reduced number of spaces must be submitted to the Director. The
parking study shall be prepared following the procedures of the Urban Land
Institute Shared Parking Report, ITE Shared Parking Guidelines or other
approved procedures. The actual number of parking spaces required shall be
based on well-recognized sources of parking data such as the ULI or ITE
reports. If the shared parking plan assumes use of an existing parking facility,
then field surveys shall be conducted to determine actual parking
accumulation.
B. Maximum Distance to Parking Spaces. Shared spaces must be located
within 500 feet of a principal building entrance of all sharing uses. Clear, safe
pedestrian connections must be provided.
C. Shared Parking Operations Plan. A shared parking operations plan must be
prepared to the satisfaction of the Director showing that parking spaces most
conveniently serve the land uses intended, directional signage is provided if
appropriate, and pedestrian links are direct and clear. On-street parking
spaces wholly adjacent to the property may be included.
D. Application. Any application for a shared/mixed-use parking reduction must
be signed by all property owners with property involved in the application.
The application should indicate the proposed number of parking spaces to be
provided and detail the amount of development and types of uses. Said
application shall be supported by a parking study as detailed in paragraph A
of this section.
E. Changes in Land Use. Future changes in use might require an updated
parking demand analysis to demonstrate any changes in parking demand
patterns. Any deficiencies will require construction of additional parking
spaces, a parking variance or maintaining the uses in place when the original
shared parking agreement was approved.
F. Planning Commission Review. Requests for shared parking might require
review and approval by the Planning Commission if deemed necessary by the
Director.

Commission. Timber harvesting requires a 75-foot undisturbed buffer along the
entire perimeter of the property if abutting a non-agricultural property.
1704.1.4 Removal of Disease or Infestation
Upon the advice of the County Extension Service or the Georgia Forestry Commission
in accordance with commonly accepted forestry practices and a finding of tree disease
or infestation, the City Clerk may authorize the removal of trees to prevent the
transmission of disease or infestation, to prevent the danger of these trees falling, or to
prevent potential injury to life and property. The owner/ developer, prior to the removal
of the diseased trees, shall notify the City Clerk, identifying the location of the infested
property, and shall submit to the City Clerk the written finding of the County Extension
Service or Georgia Forestry Commission. Upon which time, the City Clerk may require
the review of a Tree Preservation/Replacement Plan to reflect a density of 24 units/acre.
1704.1.5 Tree Thinning
The thinning of trees (selective cutting only) solely for the purpose of good forestry
management, may be permitted upon authorization by the City Clerk and shall require
the submittal and approval of a Tree Preservation/Replacement Plan. Permits
authorizing tree thinning shall be limited to the following:
A. A 75-foot natural undisturbed buffer (not a zoning buffer) shall be provided and
maintained along the entire perimeter of the property, including road frontages,
during the land disturbing activity, except for authorized road crossings.
B. The property shall be required to meet a Tree Density Standard of 20 units per
acre upon completion of authorized land disturbing activities.

meet the buffer requirements of the this Article or conditions of zoning, special use or
variance approval shall not be considered in fulfilling the requirements of this Article.
Trees or other vegetation shall not be removed from a zoning buffer area except under
the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.
1704.1.7 Easement Exemption
Properties possessing natural gas, petroleum or electric power transmission
easements, or sanitary sewer main (greater than 8 inches in diameter) or water main
(greater than 16 inches in diameter) distribution easements, may exclude the land area
contained in said easement from the total acreage of the property in fulfilling the Tree
Density Standard of this Article provided that no improvements (e.g. parking lots, tennis
courts, driveways, stormwater detention facilities, etc.) are proposed within the
easement. If any improvements are proposed within the easement, then the land area
so utilized within the easement for the improvement, plus an additional 10 feet of land
area surrounding the improvements, shall be used to fulfill the Tree Density Standard of

SECTION 1704.6 Density Factor Analysis.
1704.6.1 Overview
A basic requirement of this Article is that all applicable sites maintain a minimum
tree density of 20 units per acre. The term "unit" is an expression of basal area (a
standard forest inventory measurement), and is not synonymous with "tree".
This density requirement must be met whether or not a site had trees prior to
development. The density may be achieved by counting existing trees to be preserved,
planting new trees, or some combination of the two as represented by the formula:
SDF = EDF + RDF
Where:
SDF (Site Density Factor) = The minimum tree density required to be maintained on a
developed site (20 units per acre).
EDF (Existing Density Factor) = Density of existing trees to be preserved on a site.
RDF (Replacement Density Factor) = Density of new trees to be planted on site.
1704.6.2 Site Density Factor
The SDF is calculated by multiplying the number of site acres by 20.
Example: A 2.2 acre site has a SDF of 2.2 x 20 = 44
1704.6.3 Existing Density Factor
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 190
The EDF is calculated by converting the diameter of individual trees to density factor
units. This is done using Table 1700.2 below.
TABLE 1700.2 - CREDIT FOR EXISTING TREES
CONVERSION FROM TREE DIAMETER IN INCHES
TO TREE DENSITY UNITS FOR TREES REMAINING ON SITE

11 .7 23 2.9 35 6.7 47 12.0
12 .8 24 3.1 36 7.1 48 12.6
13 .9 25 3.4 37 7.5 49 13.1
14 1.1 26 3.7 38 7.9 50 13.6
Note: Tree diameter for existing trees is measured at 4.5 feet above the ground.
Note: Tree diameter fractions may be rounded up if 0.5 inches or greater or
rounded down if less than 0.5 inches.
Example:
A total of 15 trees will remain on the 2.2 acre site. The tree inventory is as follows:
7 - 12" diameter pines
3 - 14" diameter pines
3 - 18" diameter oaks
1 - 21" diameter hickory
1 - 30" diameter oak
Converting diameters (DBH) to density units, the EDF is determined as shown in the
following example:
Scientific Name Common Name DBH Units No. of Trees Totals
Acer barbatum Florida Maple 12" 0.8 x 7 = 5.6
Ginkgo biloba Ginkgo, grafted 14" 1.1 x 3 = 3.3
Pinua strobes White Pine 18" 1.8 x 3 = 5.4
Quercus alba White Oak 21" 2.0 x 1 = 2.4
Quercus falcata Southern Red Oak 30" 4.9 x 1 = 4.9
21.6
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 191
1704.6.4 Replacement Density Factor
A) Calculate the RDF by subtracting the EDF from the SDF.
Example: RDF = 44 - 21.4 = 22.6
The density factor credit for each caliper size of replacement (new) trees is shown in
Table 1700.3. Any number or combination of transplantable size trees can be used so
long as their total density factor units will equal or exceed the RDF and the species list
is accepted by the City Engineer.
B) All replacement trees shall be selected from one of the City maintained tree
lists (per Section 1704.8.3)
C) No more than 30% of all replacement trees to be planted on site may be of any one
species. Show calculation on plan that demonstrates compliance with this
requirement.
D) No more than 15% of all replacement trees to be planted on a site may be from the
limited understory and overstory tree lists.

1704.6.5 Unique Requirements
A. Subdivisions
New residential, commercial and industrial subdivisions are subject to a
two-staged review process (for the infrastructure and later for each
individual lot). For this reason, these subdivisions may base density
calculations on the net site area defined by the limits of construction of the
infrastructure(roads, utility lines, detention ponds, etc.). For residential
subdivisions the per lot compensation shall be determined prior to
approval of a final plat.
B. Additions to Existing Projects
For additions to existing projects, the density requirements may be met in
one of the following ways:
 When more than 50% of the property of a developed project site is
disturbed for either redevelopment or improvement, the requirements
of this Article apply to the entire site.
 When less than 50% of the property of a developed project site is
disturbed for either redevelopment or improvement, the project shall
meet the requirements of this Article for just the improved or
redeveloped portion of the site.
C. Phased Projects and Reduced Net Site Areas
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 193
Where development is going to occur in increments (by design or by
implication), density calculations must be based on a site area defined by
an established or estimated phase line.
The following criteria are applied regarding existing trees:
 Existing trees to be counted toward meeting the density requirements
should be within the phase line or limits of construction.
 The trees in areas outside the phase line or limits of construction may
not be counted toward the density requirement of subsequent phases
or new projects.
SECTION 1704.7 Tree Preservation Standards.
1704.7.1 Introduction
The following section establishes standards by which plans and field conditions are to
be evaluated to determine compliance with the tree preservation intent of this Article.
1704.7.2 Tree Inventories and Surveys
All trees that are to be counted toward meeting density requirements must be surveyed
and inventoried according to size and species and shown on the tree inventory plan.
The plan must accurately show and list the total density value of the trees that are to be
counted toward meeting density requirements. Trees in any buffer areas need not be
inventoried.
Specimen trees must be shown on the plan with an indication whether they are to be
retained or removed. All specimen trees that are to be preserved as well as those
proposed for removal must be shown on the survey and inventoried by size and
species. Accurate locations are requested when the preservation of a specimen tree is
questionable, or when a site design alteration is feasible.
On sites with significant tree save areas, tree sampling may be allowed subject to the
approval of the Planning and Inspections Director. All tree surveys shall be certified.
The tree survey must be performed by an actual field survey by a registered land
surveyor and a certified arborist, registered landscape architect, or a registered forester.
Each professional must be identified by name, address and phone number on the
survey.
1704.7.3 Plan Review Standards
All buffer areas must be delineated on the plan along with a designation whether
protection during construction is to be active or passive (See Construction Standards
below). Tree Save Areas established to preserve specimen trees must be dimensioned
on the plan and must include the entire critical root zone for the tree(s). All buffers with
existing trees must be delineated on plans as Tree Save Areas. Land disturbance
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 194
within any buffer (See Article III, Definitions) is subject to City approval. The applicant
must clearly demonstrate the need for the proposed disturbance.
1704.7.4 Construction Standards
A. Purpose of Tree Protection Devices
Tree protection devices are necessary to eliminate activities detrimental to
trees including but not limited to:
 Soil compaction in the critical root zone resulting from heavy
equipment, vehicular or excessive pedestrian traffic, or storage of
equipment or materials;
 Root disturbance due to cuts, fills or trenching;
 Wounds to exposed roots, trunks or limbs by mechanical equipment;
 Other activities such as chemical storage, cement truck cleaning, fire,
etc.
B. Location and Types of Tree Protection Devices
Tree protection devices are to be installed as shown on the plan or
otherwise completely surrounding the critical root zone (See Article III,
Definitions) of all trees to be preserved.
The plan shall indicate whether the tree protection device is to be active or
passive.
 Active protection (see Materials section below) is required where Tree
Save Areas are located in proximity to construction activity).
Construction buffers require active protection.
 Passive protection (see Materials section below) may be used in more
remote and undisturbed locations.
The locations of all tree protection devices will be verified prior to the
issuance of any Land Disturbance Permit. Once Tree Save Areas are
established and approved, any changes are subject to re-review.
C. Materials
1. Active tree protection shall consist of silt fence with continuous
ribbon, orange laminated plastic, wooden post, rail fencing
and/other equivalent restraining material. In addition to fencing,
where tree trunks are in jeopardy of being damaged by equipment,
2 x 4 inch boards may be requested to be strapped around the
trunks of trees.
2. Passive protection shall consist of plastic flagging a minimum of
four (4) inches wide with dark letters on a bright background
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 195
reading "Tree Protection Area - Do Not Enter," or equivalent
signage on a continuous, durable restraint.
D. Sequence of Installation and Removal
All tree protection devices shall be installed prior to any clearing, grubbing
or grading. The City Inspector, if deemed necessary, inspect the
installation of tree protection and erosion and sedimentation control
devices prior to the issuance of any Land Disturbance Permit. Tree
protection must remain in functioning condition throughout all phases of
development.
E. Other Specifications
1. Clearing - Where clearing has been approved, trees shall be
removed in a manner which does not adversely impact the trees to
be preserved. Avoid felling trees into Tree Save Areas or
disturbing roots inside Tree Save Areas.
2. Erosion and Sedimentation Control - All erosion and sedimentation
control measures shall be installed in a manner which will not result
in the accumulation of sediment in any Tree Save Areas. Silt
fences shall be installed along the outer uphill edges of tree save
areas.
3. Signage - All tree protection zones shall be designated as such with
"Tree Save Area" signs posted visibly on all sides of the fenced-in
areas. These signs are intended to inform subcontractors of the
tree protection process.
4. Utilities  Reasonable efforts shall be made to locate utility lines
outside tree save areas. If utility lines must encroach in the tree
save areas they shall be installed by tunneling rather than
trenching.
5. Signs - Signs requesting subcontractors cooperation and
compliance with the tree protection standards are recommended for
site entrances.
1704.7.5 Tree Registry
A. Trees or groups of trees which are documented to be of historic merit, of an
uncommon or endangered species, or are of extraordinary value due to their age,
size or type, may be registered in the City of Suwanee Tree Registry. It shall be
the duty of the Planning Department to maintain and keep this registry on file.
B. Registry of trees shall be voluntary and may be done by the owner(s) of the
property on which the tree is located. Registration shall not run with the land,
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 196
unless the property owner wishes to use an express trust to transfer a benefit in
the tree or groups of trees to the City.
SECTION 1704.8 Tree Replacement Standards.
1704.8.1 Introduction
The following section establishes standards by which plans and field conditions are to
be evaluated to determine compliance with the tree replacement intent of this Article.
Tree Replacement Plans should be prepared with appropriate consideration given to the
function of trees in the urban landscape. Every effort should be made to maximize the
environmental benefit of the plant material.
1704.8.2 Planting Specifications
Replacement tree proposed to be planted for credit toward meeting the minimum
required Tree Density standards on a property shall comply with the following:
A. Trees selected for planting must be free from injury, pests, disease, nutritional
disorders or root defects, and must be of good vigor in order to assure a
reasonable expectation of survivability. The following criteria are generally used
for the determination of vigor:
1. Foliage should have a green or dark green color. Vigorous trees will have
large leaves and dense foliage when compared to trees with poor vigor.
2. Shoot growth for most vigorous trees will be at least one (1) foot per year.
One half or more of the foliate should be on the branches originating from the
lower two-thirds of the trunk, and one-half should originate from the upper
third.
3. Bark texture can denote vigor. Smooth or shiny bark on the trunk and
branches usually denotes good vigor, conversely, rough and full bark could
indicate poor vigor.
4. Trunk taper. The trunks of vigorous trees will generally have a decrease in
trunk diameter with increasing height. Trees with reverse tapers or no taper
should be avoided.
5. Root color. Young roots of most trees will be light in color.
6. Trees selected for planting must be free of root defects. Two types of root
defects generally occur:
a. Kinked roots, in which taproots, major roots, or both are bent more
than 90 degrees with less than 20 percent of the root system
originating above the kink. A tree with such roots will probably bend at
the soil line when released from a supporting stake.
b. Circling or girdling roots which circle 80 percent or more of the root
system by 360 degrees or more. A tree with such roots would
ultimately have less than 20 percent of its system available for support.
B. Standards for transplanting shall be in keeping with those established in the
International Society of Arboriculture publication Tree and Shrub Transplanting
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 197
Manual or similar publication. Reference the American Association of
Nurserymen publication American Standard for Nursery Stock (ANSI Z60, 1973)
for plant material quality specifications. Reference the Manual of Woody
Landscape Plants (Michael Dirr, 1983, Castle Books) or similar publication for
information on tree species site requirements.
C. Planting Procedures:
1. Planting holes should be at least three times the diameter of the root ball.
2. Trees should not be planted deeper than they were in their former location or
container.
3. Spade compacted bottom and sides of the planting hole should be roughed or
scarified to allow the penetration of developing roots.
4. Good water drainage from the bottom of the planting hole is essential for root
regeneration.
5. Once the transplanted tree is set, the hole should be backfilled with soil of
good texture and structure. Traditionally, backfill material is comprised of a
mix of negative soil, organic matter such as peat, and inorganic material such
as perlite or vermiculite in a 1:1 ratio. There are indications that a backfill with
native soil alone may be adequate.
6. The addition of fertilizer to backfill soil can cause root injury, and is therefore
not recommended. If fertilizer must be added, a low rate should be used.
Approximately, 1.5 pounds of nitrogen per cubic yard of backfill is
recommended for bare root plants, and 2.5 pounds of nitrogen per cubic yard
of backfill for balled and burlapped trees.
7. The backfill should be gently tamped (but not compacted), and soaked for
settling.
8. The soil should be slightly mounded to allow for settling; a ridge or dike
around the perimeter of the hole can facilitate watering.
1704.8.3 Species
The Planning and Inspections Department shall maintain the following tree lists:
1) Recommended Overstory Tree List
2) Recommended Limited Overstory Tree List
3) Recommended Understory Tree List
4) Recommended Limited Understory Tree List
5) Recommended Ornamental Tree List
6) Recommended Evergreen Hedgerow List
The purpose of these lists is to establish a compilation of trees physically suitable to the
City of Suwanee environment and to compliment the Citys existing urban forest. All
trees or hedgerow shrubs planted to meet the requirements of this article shall be
selected from one of the above lists maintained by the Planning and Inspections
Department. Each tree list shall include the scientific name, common name, anticipated
canopy area, suitability for parking lots, suitability of use as a street tree, and whether
the tree is a native species or not. The hedgerow list shall include the scientific name,
common name and anticipated height.
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 198
The Planning and Inspections Department develops and maintains these lists of
suitable overstory and understory tree species and hedgerow species that may be
planted within the City of Suwanee. The tree and hedgerow lists shall be updated as
new cultivars or new species are introduced, as issues arise with current species such
as diseases or pests, and to ensure that trees are being planted that meet the purpose
and intent of the ordinance.
1704.8.4 Minimum Root Zones
In order to provide sufficient growing area for planted trees, the following minimum
criteria must be observed unless otherwise approved.
Large trees - 200 sq. ft. of pervious root zone
Small trees - 100 sq. ft. of pervious root zone
All planting strips - Five (5) ft. minimum width
1704.8.5 Irrigation
Newly planted trees and existing trees subjected to construction impacts typically need
supplemental watering when rainfall is inadequate. Applicants should be prepared to
discuss how trees are to be watered during their establishment or transition period, and
possibly note on the plan the method of irrigation that is proposed.
SECTION 1704.9 Specimen Trees.
1704.9.1 Identification
Some trees on a site warrant special consideration due to their species, distinctive form,
appearance, rarity, historical significance, age, ecological value, or other unique
characteristic. These trees are referred to as specimen trees. As such, these trees
should be preserved.
The following criteria are used by the City of Suwanee to identify specimen trees. Size,
appearance, health, and overall condition criteria must be met for a tree to qualify.
Size Criteria
 Large Hardwoods: 24-inch diameter or larger
 Large Softwoods: 24-inch diameter or larger
 Small Trees (See Article III, Definitions): 12-inch diameter or larger
Condition Criteria
 Life expectancy of greater than 15 years.
 Relatively sound and solid trunk with no extensive decay.
 No more than one major and several minor dead limbs (hardwoods only).
 No major insect or pathological problem.
 The tolerance of the species to changes in the site.
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 199
 The future level of maintenance that will be required.
 Well defined broad canopy
 Full branching throughout
If a tree does not meet the size criteria but is shown to be a rare species, have historical
significance, ecological value, or other unique characteristics, the City may deem the
tree to be a specimen tree.
1704.9.2 Preservation
In order to encourage the preservation of specimen trees and the incorporation of these
trees into the design of projects, additional density credit will be given for specimen
trees which are successfully saved by a design feature specifically designated for such
purposes. Credit for any specimen tree thus saved would be two (2) times the assigned
unit value shown in Table 1700.2.
1704.9.3 Removal and Replacement
If a specimen tree is to be removed, a plan or written documentation from a qualified
expert (certified arborist or registered forester) indicating the reason for the removal
must be submitted to and approved by the City.
Specimen trees must be replaced by species with potentials for comparable size and
quality. Trees intended to replace a specimen may not be any smaller than 3 caliper
dbh.
Any specimen tree which is removed must be replaced by trees with a total density
equal to two (2) times the unit value of the tree removed. Size alone will determine
whether a tree was of specimen quality if the tree is removed without approval and there
is no evidence of this condition.
SECTION 1705 Compliance.
SECTION 1705.1 Artificial Materials Prohibited.
All artificial plants, trees, shrubs grass or other vegetation shall be prohibited from
fulfilling the requirements of this Article.
SECTION 1705.2 Warranty or Maintenance Surety.
Upon final installation of new trees, shrubs or other landscape material planted to meet
the requirements of this Article, and following acceptance by the City Inspector in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the Development Regulations, the owner
shall either provide proof of warranty or post a Maintenance Bond or other acceptable
surety, warranting the new trees, shrubs or landscape material for a period of no less
than one (1) year.
SECTION 1705.3 Inspection.
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 200
1705.3.1 Pre-Construction Inspection
Prior to the issuance of any Land Disturbance Permit, the City of Suwanee must inspect
all tree protection devices for compliance with the approved plans. Land Disturbance
Permits will not be issued until tree protection fencing has been installed correctly.
1705.3.2 Construction Inspection
During construction, the City Inspector will periodically inspect all projects to assure the
adequacy of tree protection fencing. Failure to adhere to the provisions of this Article
will constitute noncompliance, and will subject the project to enforcement procedures
found in Section 1706.2 of this Article.
1705.3.3 Final Inspection
Prior to the release of the project for final platting or Certificate of Occupancy, or other
form of acceptance, the City Inspector shall inspect for compliance with all
requirements. NOTE: Procedures for final inspections may vary when
consideration must be given to the peculiarities of a particular type of
construction project. Any disturbances in Tree Save Areas or deficiencies in the
required Site Density Factor will be cited at this time. Tree Save Area disturbances
and/or SDF deficiencies must be corrected with new tree plantings prior to project
release.
Existing trees which are not expected to survive will not be counted toward meeting
density requirements. Conversely, any existing trees not shown to remain on plans but
which have been preserved (meeting all tree preservation standards) through field
adjustments may be counted toward density requirements, provided that all changes
are accepted by the City Engineer.
New tree plantings may be postponed for up to nine (9) months by posting
performance security. The project will not be released until after receipt of the
security by City of Suwanee
1705.3.4 Maintenance Inspection
Trees preserved to meet the required site density which are dead or near death at the
time of the maintenance inspection must be replaced if there is evidence that the
demise of such trees was due to construction injury. One full growing season (see
Article III, Definitions) after the date of the inspection of new tree installations, the City
Inspector will inspect all trees on the project site. Any trees planted to meet the
required Site Density Factor which are dead or near death must be replaced. Trees
preserved to meet the required site density which are dead or near death at the time of
the maintenance inspection must be replaced if there is evidence that the demise of
such trees was due to construction injury.
Any trees required to be replaced by this inspection must be planted within 30 days of
receipt of notification by the current owner(s). New tree plantings may be postponed for
up to six (6) months by posting performance security (see next section). Failure to plant
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 201
new trees in accordance with these provisions will constitute noncompliance, and will
subject the project to possible civil penalties.
SECTION 1705.4 Performance Surety.
1705.4.1 Compliance Prior to Certificate of Occupancy or Final Plat Approval
In the event that new trees proposed to be planted to achieve the Tree Density
Standard as set forth in the Article contained herein, or other trees or landscape
material required to be planted as set forth herein, are not installed upon application for
a Certificate of Occupancy or Final Plat Approval as appropriate to the project, then a
Performance Bond or other acceptable surety in an amount equal to 110% of the value
of the new trees or landscape material and their installation shall be posted in
accordance with the performance bonding requirements and provisions of the
Development Regulations.
1705.4.2 Compliance Upon Permit Completion or Expiration
Properties where a permit is issued to conduct land disturbing activities that do not
require the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy or the approval of a Final Plat, or
said activities as authorized are completed or the permit expires, shall comply with the
Tree Density Standard of this Article.
A. Clearing, Clearing and Grubbing, or Grading Only Permits
Replacement trees proposed to be planted to achieve the Tree Density Standard
of this Article which are not planted upon completion or prior to expiration of a
Clearing, Clearing and Grubbing, or Grading Permit, shall be planted within 30
days of the completion or expiration of said permit unless a Performance Bond is
posted with the City. Any site that allows a permit to expire without installation of
the approved landscaping shall be deemed to be in violation of this ordinance.
B. Development Permits
Replacement trees proposed to be planted to achieve the Tree Density Standard
of this Article which are not planted upon expiration, as opposed to completion, of
a Development Permit shall be planted within 30 days of expiration of said permit
unless a Performance Bond is posted. Any site that allows a permit to expire
without installation of the approved landscaping shall be deemed to be in
violation of this ordinance.
1705.4.3 Continuing Maintenance
The owner, occupant, tenant, and respective agent of each, if any, shall be jointly and
severally responsible for the perpetual maintenance and protection of buffers and
landscape plantings required by this Article or any previously adopted landscape
requirements.
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 202

the director certifies to the Board after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with
him/her, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his/her opinion,
cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings may be stayed by
a restraining order granted by the City of Suwanee Zoning Board of Appeals or by a
court of competent jurisdiction on application, on notice to the officer from whom the
appeal is taken, and on good cause shown.
SECTION 2008. Special Exceptions.
A. Standards for Consideration. In considering all applications for a Special
Exception to the Zoning Ordinance, the Board shall, before granting any Special

period shall being on the date the order of Superior Court becomes final.
C. Reapplication. An application for a Special Exception which has been denied by
the Board shall not be resubmitted for a period of one (1) year from the date of
the Public Hearing. If additional information is furnished which warrants
consideration before the one-year period has expired, the Board may instruct the
Secretary to accept an application for a rehearing notwithstanding this
Ordinance.
SECTION 2009. Variances.
A. Standards for Consideration. In considering all applications for a Variance to the
Zoning Ordinance, the Board shall, before granting any Variance from the
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 210
Ordinance in a specific case, first determine that it will not unreasonably increase
the congestion in public streets, or increase the danger of fire or endanger the
public safety, or unreasonably diminish or impair established property values
within the surrounding area, or in any other respect impair the public health,
safety, comfort, morals, or welfare of the inhabitants of the City.
B. Reapplication. An application for a Variance which has been denied by the
Board shall not be resubmitted for a period of one (1) year from the date of the

D. The City shall erect a sign in a conspicuous place on the property involved, at
least fifteen (15) days before the public hearing, giving notice of the date, time,
place, and purpose of the hearing/pending appeal.
SECTION 2011. Appeals From Decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals.
Any person or persons who may have substantial interest in any decision of the board,
or any officer, board or bureau of the City, may appeal from any decision of the said

special use proposal is in conformity with the policy and intent of the land use

ARTICLE XXII
SPECIAL USE PERMITS
Section 2201. Intended Use of Special Permits.
The Special Use Permit is designed to be used when:
a. A special use listed under the zoning district is desired for development
and a more intensive zoning district which contains that use as a use by
right would not be appropriate for the property, or,
b. A special use listed under the zoning district is desired for development
and no zoning district contains that use as a use by right, or,
c. A unique use not addressed in any zoning district is desired for
development and is not likely to be duplicated within the City of Suwanee,
or,
d. The neighboring properties may be affected by the height of any nonresidential
or multi-family residential building or structure, and,
e. The special use would be consistent with the needs of the neighborhood
or the community as a whole, be compatible with the neighborhood and
would not be in conflict with the overall objective of the Comprehensive
Plan.
Section 2202. Special Use Permit Minimum Requirements.
In order to accommodate these special uses, the Special Use Permit allows the City
Council to approve a special use on a particular parcel without changing the general
zoning district. Such approval shall be subject to the requirements set forth below and
any surrounding properties. All Special Use Permit applications shall not be used for
securing early zoning for conceptual proposals which may not be undertaken for some
time. A Special Use Permit application shall be considered only if it is made by the
owner of the property or his/her authorized agent. The minimum requirements for a
Special Use Permit are:
1. Any uses permitted under a Special Use Permit shall also conform
to the requirements of this ordinance and the development
regulations for the use as found in the zoning district.
2. The application and review process for a Special Use Permit shall
be the same as for the zoning district under which the special use is
found. In addition to the information and/or site plans which are
required to be submitted for the proposed development, additional
information deemed necessary by the Director in order to evaluate
a proposed use and its relationship to the surrounding area shall be
submitted. In the review process, particular emphasis shall be
given to the immediate neighborhood and the compatibility of the
proposed use with its neighborhood.
3. In the approval process for a Special Use Permit application, the
City Council shall consider the policies and objectives of the
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 217
Comprehensive Plan, particularly in relationship to the proposed
site and surrounding area, and shall consider the potential adverse
impact on the surrounding area, especially in regards but not
limited to traffic, storm drainage, land values and compatibility of
land use activities.
4. If an application is approved and a special sue permit is granted, all
conditions which may have been attached to the approval are
binding on the property. All subsequent development and use of
the property shall be in accordance with the approved plan and
conditions.
5. Changes to a special use, or development of a site for the special
use, shall be treated as an amendment to the Special Use Permit
and shall be subject to the same application and review process as
a new application.
6. An application for a Special Use Permit in a residential district and
which use is proposed to operate in a dwelling or as an accessory
use to a dwelling is subject to the following additional requirements:
a. The special use shall operate within the dwelling on the
property or, if approved by the City Council, in an
accessory structure.
b. The exterior character of the dwelling shall be preserved in
its residential state and there shall be no outside evidence
of the operation of the special use to the neighborhood,
except for any accessory structure approved by the City
Council.
c. The owner of the property shall occupy the property and
shall operate any business associated with the special use.
d. The owner of the property shall submit with the application
a signed statement in which he/she agrees that the Special
Use Permit, if approved, shall automatically terminate in
the event that the property is sold, transferred, or otherwise
conveyed to any other party, or the business which
operates the special use is sold, transferred, otherwise
conveyed or discontinued. The owner shall also agree to
notify the Director in writing upon the occurrence of any of
these events.
e. In addition to the information and/or site plans required by
this Section, the owner of the property shall submit with the
application for a Special Use Permit information regarding
the ownership of any business associated with the use, the
experience and background qualifications related to the
1998 ZONING ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF SUWANEE (Revision January 23, 2018) PAGE 218
operation of said business, prior similar businesses
operated, applicable State of Georgia certifications,
licenses and like information.
7. The owner of the property approved for Special Use Permit may
voluntarily request termination of the Special Use Permit by
notifying the Director in writing.
8. The Planning and Inspections Department shall have the right to
periodically examine the operation of the specific use to determine
compliance with the requirements and any conditions. If the
Director determines that the requirements and conditions are being
violated, a written notice shall be issued to the owner of the
property outlining the nature of the violation and giving the owner of
the property a maximum of thirty (30) days to come into
compliance. If after thirty (30) days the violations continue to exist,
the Director shall forward a report to the City Council through the
Planning Commission which may recommend that action be taken
to remove the Special Use Permit from the property.

which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption
of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for
flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare;
b. Flood hazard areas can serve important stormwater management, water quality,
streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetland preservation and
ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally
disturbed areas;
c. Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection activities can (1)
Protect human life and health; (2) Minimize damage to private property; (3)
Minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas
mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains; and (4) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the
general public; and,
d. Article IX, Section II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia and Section 36-1-
20(a) of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated have delegated the responsibility
to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City of Suwanee,
Gwinnett County, Georgia, does ordain this ordinance and establishes this set of
floodplain management and flood hazard reduction policies for the purpose of
regulating the use of flood hazard areas. It is determined that the regulation of
flood hazard areas and the prevention of flood damage are in the public interest and
will minimize threats to public health and safety, as well as to private and public
property.

cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure prior to
the improvement. The market value of the structure should be:
a. The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or
improvement; or,
b. In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring.
This term includes structures which have incurred repetitive loss or "substantial damage"
regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this
definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of
any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the structure commences, whether or not
that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not,
however, include any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations
of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified
by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure
safe living conditions or any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure".
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions - Where the
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals
or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair,

plans and engineering calculations as required by this ordinance for "no rise"
City of Suwanee Floodplain Management Ordinance Adopted September 19, 2006
Page 16 of 31
certification. The Department shall review and authorize such encroachments prior
to the issuance of a Development Permit and shall obtain from the applicant an
engineering "no-rise" certification signed by a professional engineer stating that the
proposed development will not create any change to the pre-project base flood
elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths. If the applicant proposes to
revise the floodway boundaries or base flood elevations, no permit authorizing an
encroachment into or the alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the
Department until an affirmative Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) or
Conditional Letter of Map Amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable, is
issued and no rise certification is approved by the Department. An application
for a map revision shall be submitted first to the Department. As-built plans and
calculations shall be required to be provided to the Department by the applicant at
the time of completion of the encroachment. Payment of any review fees
associated with the review and approval of the encroachment shall be the
responsibility of the applicant. Final Plats or Certificates of Occupancy shall not
be issued by the Department until an affirmative Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)
or Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), whichever is applicable, is issued.
b. Flood Levels Resulting from Floodway Encroachments.
(1) Encroachments into a floodway established on the Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps or FIRM, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other developments shall be prohibited except for
activities specifically allowed in (2) below.
(2) Encroachments for bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities within the
regulatory floodway may be permitted provided it is demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase
to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway
widths during the base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer
must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof.
(3) In areas where the floodplain has been established but the base flood
elevation (BFE) and/or the floodway has not been established on FIS maps,
no encroachments into areas of special flood hazard, including fill or
structures, shall be authorized unless certification by a registered
professional engineer is provided to the Department demonstrating that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water
surface elevation of the floodplain more than 0.01 feet at any point. The
study shall be submitted as a revision/ amendment to the FIS maps
showing the BFE and the floodway. Approval of the revision/ amendment
must be received before the Final Plat can be approved or a Certificate of
Occupancy can be issued.

1.4.3 General Standards.
a. No construction or structures, including grading, filling, cutting or displacement of
earth shall be allowed within the base flood or future conditions floodplain that
could result in any of the following:
(1) Raise the base flood or future conditions flood elevation equal to or more
than 0.01 feet.
(2) Reduce the base flood or future conditions flood storage capacity. All
compensation shall occur either within the boundaries of ownership of the
property being developed, or within a permanent, recorded flood control
easement (which shall be a part of the Departmental record), and shall be
within a reasonable proximity to the location of the encroachment.
Acceptable means of providing required compensation include: lowering of
natural ground elevations within the floodplain; or, lowering of adjoining
land areas to create additional floodplain; or raising of the future conditions
flood elevation within the boundaries of ownership of the property being
developed. All cut areas are to be graded to a slope of no less than 2
percent. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via
bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the top of the
natural (pre-development) stream channel unless such excavation results
from widening or relocation of the stream channel. A step-backwater
analysis will be required to verify no rise conditions, flood storage
volumes, and flow characteristics.
(3) Change the flow characteristics of the waters of the base flood or future
conditions flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream
boundaries of the property. Verification shall be provided via a stepbackwater
analysis.
(4) Create hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or result in excessive
sedimentation.
b. All proposed development shall have public utilities and facilities, such as sewer,
gas, electrical and water systems, located and constructed to minimize or eliminate
flood damage.
c. Any significant changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on
the City of Suwanee and/or Gwinnett County FIRM shall be submitted as a
Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) or Conditional Letter of Map
Amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal shall be
subject to approval by the Department using the Community Consent forms before
forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval. The responsibility
for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval
shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Within six months of the completion of
construction, the applicant shall submit as-built surveys for a final Letter of Map
Revision (LOMR). A Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) or Letter of Map
Amendment (LOMA) must be issued before the Final Plat can be approved or a
City of Suwanee Floodplain Management Ordinance Adopted September 19, 2006
Page 19 of 31
Certificate of Occupancy can be issued. Significant changes or revisions shall be
defined as any change to the City of Suwanee and/or Gwinnett County FIRM
easily observed when plotted at a scale of 1" = 500'. The changes or revisions may
be due to but are not limited to more current and/or superior topographic
information or compensatory cut and fill grading done as a part of the
development.
1.4.4 Engineering Study Requirements.
An engineering study is required (as appropriate to the proposed development activities on
the site) when a base flood or future conditions floodplain is located on the property of the
proposed development. This study shall be prepared by a currently registered Professional

must use a step-backwater analysis approved by the Department. Cross-sections
(which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be
obtained whenever available. Where applicable, computations will be shown
duplicating FIS results and then computations will then be rerun with the proposed
modifications to determine the new base flood and future conditions flood profiles.
c. Floodplain storage calculations based on cross-sections (at least one every 100
feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions must be provided to
show that future conditions floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by
the development.
d. If changes to the base flood or future conditions flood elevation are proposed,
profiles of the channel showing the existing and proposed base flood or future
conditions flood elevations must be provided.
e. The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as
appropriate, which shall clearly define all future conditions floodplain
encroachments.
f. The floodway shall be determined when any encroachment in the floodplain is
proposed or a detailed study is performed to determine flood profiles.
g. Detailed flood studies in areas where the floodplain has been established but the
base flood elevation (BFE) and/or floodway has not been established and in areas
beyond the limits of study on the FIRM, which contain a watercourse, and have
greater than 100 acres of surface drainage area above the property, shall be
submitted showing the base flood elevation, future conditions flood elevations,

SECTION IV. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION
CONTROL USING BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES
A. GENERAL PROVISIONS
Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities.
Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not excluded by this ordinance shall
contain provisions for application of soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and practices.
The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion and sedimentation control plans. Soil erosion
and sedimentation control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of
Section IV B. & C. of this ordinance. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all
features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary
and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion and
sedimentation pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity.
B. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS/BMP's
City of Suwanee Soil & Erosion Control Ordinance 7
1. Best management practices as set forth in Section IV B. & C. of this ordinance shall be
required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best
management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the Director
or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any
substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued
pursuant to subsection (f) of Code Section 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act".
As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in
accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and
Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 subsection (b ).
2. A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have
not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of
any land-disturbing permit issued by a local Issuing Authority or by the Division or of any state
general permit issued by the Division pursuant to subsection (f) of Code Section 12-5-30, the
"Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the
turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25
nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten
nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the
receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the Director.
This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of
single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless
the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres.
3. Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a
violation of any land- disturbing permit issued by a local Issuing Authority or any state general
permit issued by the Division pursuant to subsection (f) of Code Section 12-5-30, the "Georgia
Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs.
4. The Director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board,
reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which
discharges from land disturbing activities occur.
C. The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to this chapter for the
purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as
stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation
and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are
consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion
and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation
Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well
as the following:
1. Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a
manner so as to minimize erosion;
2. Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
3. Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest
practical erosion potential;
4. Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
5. The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a
practicable minimum;
6. Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
7. Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during
development;
City of Suwanee Soil & Erosion Control Ordinance 8
8. Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as
practicable;
9. To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins,
sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in
this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous
compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et. seq.;
10. Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face
of excavations or the sloping of fills;
11. Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;
12. Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to
adversely affect other property owners;
13. Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when
such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum;
14. Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion and sedimentation control shall include provisions
for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities
to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels
specified in Section IV B. 2. of this ordinance;
15. Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25 foot buffer
along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation
has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the City of Suwanee and
the Director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and
the environment, where otherwise allowed pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-2-8, or where a drainage
structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion
control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented;
provided, however, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5,
Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a
variance is granted by the City and the Director as provided in this paragraph. The following
requirements shall apply to any such buffer:
a. No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall
remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing
activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the
site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a
protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and
a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed;
provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when
such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own
occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective
vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural
canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b. The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities provided that
they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of
perpendicular to the stream; cause a width disturbance of not more than 50 feet
within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the
project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water
lines; or (ii) Stream crossing for sewer lines; and
16. There is established a 50 foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation
has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters
classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water
City of Suwanee Soil & Erosion Control Ordinance 9
Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed ;
provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge
an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25 foot buffer or they may
be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a
general variance promulgated by the Board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the
downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for
any adjacent trout streams. The Director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow landdisturbing
activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the
project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply
to such buffer:
a. No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall
remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing
activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the
site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a
protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and
a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed:
provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when
such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own
occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective
vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural
canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and
b. The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that
they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of
perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet
within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the
project plans and specification and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water
lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines.
D. Nothing contained in this chapter shall prevent any Local Issuing Authority from adopting rules
and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed
the minimum requirements in Section IV B. & C. of this ordinance.
E. The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the
property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the
standards provided for in this ordinance or the terms of the permit.
SECTION V. APPLICATION/PERMIT PROCESS

shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the
primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be
responsible for installation and maintenance of the best management practices where the secondary
City of Suwanee Soil & Erosion Control Ordinance 13
permittee is conducting the land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a
person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the
approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this ordinance, a written notice to
comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to
achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the
person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be
deemed in violation of this ordinance.
B. The City shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary
to carry out duties as prescribed in this ordinance, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times
upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of
land-disturbing activities.
C. No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the Issuing
Authority, the Commission, the District, or Division who requests entry for the purposes of
inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or
interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties.
D. The Districts or the Commission or both shall periodically review the actions of counties and
municipalities which have been certified as Local Issuing Authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8
(a). The Districts or the Commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or
municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's
erosion and sedimentation control program. The Districts or the Commission shall notify the
Division and request investigation by the Division if any deficient or ineffective local program is
found.
E. The Board, on or before December 31, 2003 shall promulgate rules and regulations setting forth the
requirements and standards for certification and the procedures for decertification of local issuing
authority. The Division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which
have been certified as Local Issuing Authorities pursuant to Code Section 12-7-8 (a). Such review
may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a
governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the
district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any
county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8 (a) has not administered or enforced
its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into
pursuant to 0.C.G.A. 12-7-7 (d), the Division shall notify the governing authority of the county or
municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall
