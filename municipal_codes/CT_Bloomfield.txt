PREFACE 
    The first ordinance of the Town of Bloomfield, Ordinance Number 1, regulated livestock at large, and read as follows: 
"ANIMALS AT LARGE     ORDINANCE NO. 1 
    "Be it enacted by the Town of Bloomfield in lawful Town Meeting for that purpose assembled:- That no horse, ass, or mule, shall be suffered and allowed to go at large on the highways, commons, or unenclosed lands in said town; nor shall any neat cattle, swine, sheep or goose, be allowed to go at large on said highways, commons or unenclosed lands, without a keeper; nor upon said unenclosed lands with such keeper without the license of the proprietor therefor. 
    And be it further enacted, if any horse, ass, mule or other neat kine, swine or sheep, shall be found going at large contrary to this By-law it shall be the duty of each hayward appointed by said town, and it shall be lawfull for any proprietor or holder of lands or any other person by his or her order, to impound every such horse, ass, mule, ox or other neat kine, swine or sheep, in the pound within said town, nearest the place where any such creature or creatures were taken, or the pound most convenient for that purpose, and the owner or owners of every such creature so impounded shall pay the sum of twenty five cents for each horse, ass, ox or other neat kine, mule or swine before the same shall be released from said pound-three cents thereof for each creature so impounded, shall belong to the poundkeeper for his fee, and the residue thereof to the person or persons who shall impound any such creature; and the owner or owners of such sheep so impounded shall pay the sum of two cents for each sheep, before the same shall be released from said pound-four fifths of which shall be to the person or persons who shall impound said sheep, and one fifth thereof to the poundkeeper for his fee. 
    And be it further enacted, if any horse, ox, or other neat kine, ass, mule, swine or sheep, allowed to go at large shall be taken and impounded from any unenclosed lands or from lands not fenced according to law by the proprietor of such lands or his order, if such beast or beasts entered such unenclosure from said highways, commons, or unenclosed lands the owner or owners of every such horse, ox or other neat kine, ass, mule, or swine, shall pay to the proprietor or proprietors of the lands whereon such beast or beasts were found the sum of twenty five cents for each horse, ox or other neat kine, ass, mule, or swine, and for every sheep two cents, in addition to the poundage aforesaid, before any such beast or beasts shall be released from said pound. 
    And be it further enacted that the liberation or discharge of any such beast or beasts so impounded, from such pound or disposition thereof when impounded as aforesaid, shall be regulated and conducted conformably to the statute law of this State entitled "An act for the providing and maintaining pounds and for regulating the impounding of creatures and for preventing rescues and pound breach". 
    And be it further enacted that when any goose or geese shall be found going at large on any of said highways or on any lands not belonging to the owner of said geese in any part of said Town it shall be lawfully for any person, and it shall be the duty of the haywards in said town to take up and confine such geese in his possession and the possessor shall give notice thereof by posting the same at the corner of the road nearest to the place where such geese were taken up, and if no owner of such geese shall appear within seven days next after the same shall be posted as aforesaid, and pay such possessor one cent per head for each goose so confined, and one cent per head for each day for keeping the same-such geese shall be forfeited to the possessor, and he shall have lawful right to convert the same to his own use. 
    Adopted at a Special Town Meeting-November 2, 1835" 
    The ordinances were subsequently codified and the codification adopted by the town council on April 24, 1962. This volume was revised June 1, 1968, and that revision constitutes the most recent ordinance codification before the publication of this Code. 
    This volume contains the Charter, Special Acts and Resolves and Code of Ordinances of Bloomfield, Connecticut. The Code is a revision and codification of all ordinances of a general and permanent nature that it was deemed advisable to include. 
    This Code is an entirely new codification and, as expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, supersedes all general and permanent ordinances not included herein or expressly saved from repeal by the Adopting Ordinance. Only ordinances of a general and permanent nature prescribed for and effecting the public as a whole are included herein. Special ordinances dealing with only a portion of the inhabitants of the Town, rather than all of them, or relating to special purposes, such as ordinances levying special assessments, providing for bond issues, paving, vacating and opening specified streets, etc., are not included. For a more specific enumeration of the types of ordinances which are not included, see Section 3 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    As will be noted, the chapters have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been appropriately catchlined to facilitate usage. Attention is also directed to the appropriate footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which also refer to relevant provisions of general state law. 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the third section of Chapter 10 is 10-3. Under this system each section is identified with its chapter. New sections may be inserted in their proper places simply by using the decimal system for amendments. Thus, if new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 5-2 and 5-3 is to be added, the new sections would be numbered 5-2.1, 5-2.2 and 5-2.3. Sections have been reserved at the end of articles and divisions to provide for future expansion. 
    New chapters may be included by the addition of a fraction after the chapter number. As an example, if the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12-1/2. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way, or in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject and in case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
    The source of each section is cited in the history note in parentheses at the end of the section. 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing. With this new looseleaf system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Codes with instructions for inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete ones. Each subsequent amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof as provided in Section 4 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them, and that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference. 
    The index to this volume has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each item has been placed under several headings, some being couched in lay phraseology, other in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
    The publishers are most grateful to all municipal officers and employees for their cooperation and interest during the preparation of this Code. Special appreciation is due Mr. Richard Goodman, Town Attorney, and Mr. Robert Milvae, Assistant Town Manager. 
    The publication of this Code was under direct supervision of George R. Langford, President, and C. Julian Manson, Code Editor-in-Chief, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    This Code is presented for the use and benefit of the citizens of the Town of Bloomfield.

CHARTER[1] 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- This charter was adopted by the voters on November 8, 2005, effective January 1, 2006.  The first Bloomfield charter was Sp. Act No. 62, approved by the Connecticut General Assembly on April 5, 1945, and approved by the electors of Bloomfield at the October 1945, election. This charter was amended twice; By Sp. Act No. 295, approved July 10, 1951; and by Sp. Act No. 95, approved April 24, 1953. The latter amendment was continued "in full force and effect, except as inconsistent" with the current charter (see Sec. 1002 of this charter); this amendment is, however, largely superseded by or inconsistent with the existing charter.

Section 307. - Public Hearing on Ordinances and Certain Non-Budgeted Appropriations. 
a.  At least one public hearing, not less than five (5) days' notice of which shall be given by publication in a newspaper having a circulation in the town and by posting in the town hall, shall be held by the council or a committee thereof before any vote making a nonbudgeted appropriation of more than one tenth of one percent (.1%) of the total annual budget of the town for the current fiscal year, or enacting or making any ordinance establishing a permanent and continuing rule or regulation of a statutory nature and of general application. 
b.  No appropriation for part of what is essentially a single transaction shall be made for the purpose of evading the provisions of this section. In determining whether a nonbudgeted appropriation is more than one tenth of one percent (.1%) of the total annual budget of the town for the current fiscal year, the council shall deduct from the appropriation a sum equal to any grant received by the town, which grant has been earmarked for said appropriation and shall deduct any revenue or reimbursement to be paid to the town which is directly associated with said appropriation. 
c.  After such public hearing, changes which the council considers advisable may be made in such vote or ordinance as finally passed. 
d.  Except as provided in Section 308 such vote or ordinance shall become effective ten (10) days after its passage has been published in one or more newspapers having a circulation in the town. The publication herein required may be by title or subject matter and need not set out such vote or ordinance in full. 
e.  Each ordinance establishing a permanent and continuing rule or regulation of a statutory nature and of general application shall be filed with and recorded by the town clerk. 
Section 308. - Referendum on certain ordinances and certain appropriations. 
a.  Upon the filing with the town clerk of a petition as set forth below, any appropriation or any ordinance passed pursuant to Section 307 shall be submitted to the electors of the town at a special election which the council must hold not less than ten (10) days no more than sixty (60) days after the filing of the petition with the town clerk. 
1.  Such petition must be filed with the town clerk within ten (10) days after the publication of the passage of said appropriation or ordinance. 
2.  The town clerk shall find and certify that such petition has been validly signed by at least seven and one-half percent (7.5%) of the total number of qualified electors of the town on the current list of the registrars of voters. 
b.  When such appropriation or ordinance shall be so submitted to the electors, it shall not take effect until such election has been held but shall take effect at the conclusion of such election unless a majority of those voting thereon, which majority is equal to or more than fifteen percent (15%) of the qualified electors as determined by the then current list of the registrars of voters, shall vote in the negative. 
c.  If a town or general election is to be held within ninety (90) days after the filing of the petition, such vote or ordinance may be submitted to the town or general election instead of a special election. 
d.  The provisions of this section shall not apply to a vote making an emergency appropriation as defined in this charter.

ARTICLE II. - 1843 RESOLVE. ANNEXATION 
ANNEXING A PART OF SIMSBURY TO BLOOMFIELD 
    Upon the petition of Henry B. Moore and others, showing that they occupy a tract of land on the east side of Talcott mountain, about five miles from north to south, and one mile wide, bordering upon the town of Bloomfield, that said mountain forms a natural division between them and the town of Simsbury, with which they are now connected, that the Farmington river also lies between them and the place of holding public meetings in said Simsbury, that said tract of land, containing a population of about three hundred and fifty persons, and seventy-five electors, that they are often incommoded by said mountain and river, in attending the public meetings in Simsbury, that they have little or no intercourse with Simsbury, in their ordinary business or in their ecclesiastical connections, but are naturally associated, both by location and intercourse, with the town of Bloomfield, where they receive their letters, and through which they necessarily pass in their way to Hartford the great market for the county, and praying to be set off to said town of Bloomfield. Whereupon, 
    Resolved by this Assembly, That the following described tract of land, to wit: beginning at the northeast corner of the town of Simsbury, and running westerly in the line of said Simsbury through the Farmington river, and as measured upon the south bank of said river, one hundred and thirty-three chains and fourteen links, to the southeast corner of land belonging to the Tariffville Manufacturing Company; thence south eighty-one degrees, west fourteen hundred thirty links, to the top of the mountain; thence southerly along the top of the mountain to the center of Flat Rock, in the highway; thence southerly eighteen degrees, east fourteen hundred links, to the top of the ledge of the mountain called "Little Phillip; thence southerly on said ledge fifty-five chains, to a point where the line of Bloomfield crosses "Little Philip;" thence north eighty-eight degrees, east ninety-four chains, to the southeast corner of Simsbury; thence northerly, in the present line of Simsbury, to the place of beginning; together with all the inhabitants now residing, or that may hereafter reside thereon, be and the same is hereby annexed to the town of Bloomfield; and to have and enjoy all the privileges and immunities thereof. The inhabitants so annexed to said Bloomfield shall pay their proportion according to the list of 1842, of all debts and claims due or existing against the town of Simsbury, at the passage of this act; and the poor of the town of Simsbury who were born within the territory above described, and have not gained a settlement elsewhere in this state than in said town of Simsbury, or who have gained a settlement in said town of Simsbury by residence, or otherwise, within said limits, shall be deemed inhabitants of the town of Bloomfield, and shall be maintained accordingly; and said town of Bloomfield shall be entitled to receive, and said town of Simsbury shall pay over to said Bloomfield, such proportion of the town deposit fund as has not been heretofore invested in the town house in said Simsbury, as the number of inhabitants on that portion of territory so annexed to Bloomfield bears to the population of said town of Simsbury, according to the census of 1840; and the town of Bloomfield shall be liable to refund the same, in the same manner that the town of Simsbury is liable therefor. 
ARTICLE III. - 1844 RESOLVE. ALTERING BOUNDARY 
ALTERING THE BOUNDARY LINE BETWEEN 
SIMSBURY AND BLOOMFIELD 
    Upon the petition of the town of Simsbury, showing to this assembly that the division line between the towns of Bloomfield and Simsbury, as established by a resolution of the general assembly passed at the May session, A. D. 1843, upon the petition of Henry B. Moore and others, is in some particulars indefinite and uncertain, and that in establishing said division line in that part thereof described in said resolution as running from "the southeast corner of land belonging to the Tariffville Manufacturing Company, thence south eighty-one degrees west, fourteen hundred thirty links, to the top of the mountain," great injustice was done to the said town of Simsbury, and that said line so described as aforesaid diverges very much from the general course of the division line between said towns of Simsbury and Bloomfield, and that the same is an unnatural and inconvenient line of division, and praying that the division line may be more plainly and definitely established, by commissioners or otherwise, from the southeast corner of Simsbury northerly to the point of the mountain mentioned in said resolve as being fourteen hundred and thirty links from the southeast corner of land belonging to the Tariffville Manufacturing Company, and that from said last mentioned point, said division line be so altered and established as to run north from said point forty-eight degrees east, to the division line between said town of Simsbury and Granby, and that all the land lying east of said line now preyed for and now within the said town of Simsbury, be set to and made part of said town of Bloomfield, as by said petition on file, dated the 22d of April, A.D. 1844, will more fully appear: 
    Resolved by this Assembly, That Martin Welles, of Wethersfield, Romeo Lowrey, of Southington, and James S. Brooks, of Meriden, be and they are hereby appointed commissioners to go and view the premises through which the present division line between the towns of Simsbury and Bloomfield now runs, and to view the route of the line which the petitioners pray may be established as the division line between said towns, and to survey, lay and define said line of division in such parts thereof as they shall deem it to be at present uncertain; and to alter the present division line and establish the same in the manner prayed for in said petition, if they shall deem it just so to do; that is to say, from the point mentioned in said resolve of the general assembly passed at the May session, A.D. 1843, as being fourteen hundred and thirty links from the southeast corner of land belonging to the Tariffville Manufacturing Company, so that the said line of division shall run from said point north forty-eight degrees east to the division line between said towns of Simsbury and Granby; first giving notice in writing to the towns of Simsbury and Bloomfield of the time and place of their meeting, at least twelve days previous to the said time of meeting. And said commissioners shall make their report in writing, describing said division line as by them established and defined, and shall lodge the same in the office of the secretary of this state. And the line of division which shall be defined and established by said commissioners, under and by virtue of this resolve, shall be and remain the line of division between said towns of Simsbury and Bloomfield; and the land lying east of and adjoining said line now in the town of Simsbury, shall become and remain a part of the said town of Bloomfield. 
ARTICLE IV. - 1917 SP. ACT NO. 92. BUILDING AUTHORITY

The salary of said inspector shall be fixed by said commission on town plan, and shall be paid by said town. Should said inspector be at any time disqualified or unable to act, said commission shall appoint a disinterested competent person to act temporarily, for said building inspector, and said person so appointed, shall have all the powers conferred upon and perform all the duties required of said inspector. 
    Section 4. Said inspector shall faithfully perform all the duties that may be required of him by the ordinances of said town passed under the authority as herein given, and shall possess all the powers conferred upon selectmen of towns by section 2611 [19-379] of the general statutes, subject to the right of appeal as provided by section 2612 [19-379] of the general statutes.

The town council shall have power to assess the cost of such drainage, grading, base and paving, including that portion contiguous to lateral and intersecting streets, one-half upon the Town of Bloomfield, and one-fourth upon the property abutting on each side of the line of such paving, provided such assessment upon abutting property shall be permitted only for the first complete base and hard-surface finished paving of any such street or part of a street upon which such property abuts. An assessment for both the base and hard-surface finished pavement may be made at the same time or an assessment for the base may be made at one time and a separate assessment for a hard-surface finished pavement at another time. (1955 Act No. 9, § 1) 
    Sec. 3. The town council shall recommend the streets or parts of streets to be paved, and shall determine the kind of base or pavement to be laid thereon, and shall ascertain the cost of such paving, based upon current bid prices. When the town council shall have recommended the construction of a base or pavement on any street or part of a street pursuant to the provisions of this act, it shall hold a hearing, notice of the time and place of which shall be given to the property owners to be affected by said assessment, if known, at least ten days before the time of hearing by depositing in the post office, postage paid, a notice of the pendency of the proceedings, signed by the town clerk and addressed to the last-known address of said property owners or to the addresses to which their most recent tax bills were sent. In the case of an estate of a deceased person in process of settlement, notice to the administrator or executor of said estate shall be deemed to be notice to the owner. Notice of the time and place of said hearing shall also be given by publication not less than ten days before the date of said hearing in a daily newspaper having a circulation in the Town of Bloomfield. The estimated cost of such paving shall be presented to or available for use at said public hearing and, after such hearing, the town council may vote to order the construction of such pavement or base, or any part of the same, and shall assess the cost thereof in the manner provided in section 2 of this act. The estimated amount of said cost shall be a lien upon the land against which it shall be assessed and shall continue to be a lien upon said land provided that, within thirty days after the passage of said vote laying out or ordering said construction, a caveat shall be entered in a record to be kept by the town clerk. 
    Sec. 4. On completion of the work a final cost shall be computed, based on the actual cost of said work, and a final assessment for said cost shall be levied in the manner provided in section 2 of this act. Said assessment shall be delivered by the town council to the tax collector of the Town of Bloomfield for collection and shall be final and conclusive on all parties in interest. 
    Sec. 5. Notice of said final assessment shall be given to all property owners affected thereby, if known, by depositing a copy of the same in the post office, postage paid, within ten days after it shall have been levied, addressed to the last-known addresses of said property owners or to the addresses to which their most recent tax bills were sent. In the case of an estate of a deceased person in process of settlement, notice to the administrator or executor of said estate shall be deemed to be notice to the owner. Notice of said assessment shall also be given by publishing a copy of the same not more than ten days after it shall have been levied in a daily newspaper having a circulation in the Town of Bloomfield. Any person aggrieved by said assessment may appeal to the court of common pleas for Hartford County pursuant to the provisions of section 690 of the general statutes. 
    Sec. 6. Payment of said assessment may be enforced in a civil action by said town or by foreclosure or by any other remedy provided by the general statutes. Said assessment shall become a lien upon the land assessed from the date it is levied and shall remain a lien in favor of the town until payment, provided no such lien shall continue for a period longer than four months after such assessment shall have been made unless, within said period, a certificate, in writing, signed by the tax collector and describing the premises, the amount claimed as a lien, the date of said final assessment and the nature of the work for which said lien is claimed, shall be lodged with the town clerk. Each such lien shall bear interest from the date of the filing thereof at the rate of one-half of one per cent per month until paid. Any such lien shall cease to exist when a certificate, signed by the tax collector and stating that the claim secured thereby, together with interest, has been paid in full, shall be lodged with the town clerk. Such liens shall take precedence over all other liens, mortgages, attachments and encumbrances of prior date except tax liens and other liens in favor of the Town of Bloomfield. (1963 Act. No. 108) 
    Sec. 7. The powers herein granted shall be in addition to the powers granted to towns under the general statutes and to the Town of Bloomfield under any special act and shall not be construed to deprive said town of any powers it has over the construction, maintenance and repair of streets and highways. 
    Sec. 8. The provisions of this act shall not apply to any street or highway, the base or pavement of which is paid for by the state provided the use of town aid funds or comparable funds provided by the state shall not constitute payment by the state within the meaning of this act. (1955 Act No. 9, § 2) 
    Sec. 9. Number 246 of the special acts of 1927, as amended by number 73 of the special acts of 1929, is repealed.

AN ACT CONCERNING SIDEWALKS, CURBING, DRIVEWAY ENTRANCES AND GUTTERS IN THE TOWN OF BLOOMFIELD 
    Section 1. The town council of the Town of Bloomfield may, upon finding, after hearing before it as herein provided, that it will serve public necessity and convenience, order the town manager to install or cause to be installed along all or part of any street or highway in the town sidewalks, curbing, driveway entrances and gutters of such dimensions, styles, kinds, forms, materials, at such grades and in accordance with such other specifications as said town council shall prescribe. Notice of such order shall be given to the owner or owners of the abutting land within ten days after the same has been made by mailing a copy of the same to the last-known place of abode of such owner or owners or by leaving a copy of the same with the agent or person having charge of or occupying such land. Before making such an order, the town council shall cause notice of the time and place of a hearing relative to the same to be given such owner or owners, at least ten days prior to the date of such hearing, by mailing a copy of said notice to the last-known place of abode of such owner or owners or by leaving a copy of the same with the agent or person having charge of or occupying such land. After the installation has been completed, one-half of the total cost of such sidewalks, curbing, driveway entrances and gutters shall be assessed upon the abutting property and its owner or owners and may be collected by lien or otherwise. One-half of the cost of such sidewalks, curbing, driveway entrances and gutters shall be assessed upon the Town of Bloomfield. Notice of such assessment and that it is due and payable shall be given by mail addressed to such owner or owners at their last-known place of abode or by leaving the same with the agent or person having charge of or occupying such property. Each such assessment, with interest at six per cent per annum starting ninety days after the date of such notice, shall be a lien upon such property from the time of the completion of the work, which lien may be foreclosed in the same manner as a tax lien, provided a certificate thereof, describing the property on which the lien exists, the amount claimed, the date of the order, the nature of the work for which such lien is claimed and the date of completion thereof, signed by the tax collector, shall be lodged with the town clerk within three months after the completion of such work. Such lien shall take precedence over all other liens, mortgages, attachments or other encumbrances except as otherwise provided by law. (1957 Act No. 259; 1963 Act No. 109) 
    Sec. 2. Whenever the town council is of the opinion that any existing sidewalk, curbing, driveway entrance or gutter, or any part thereof, is in need of repair or replacement in order to make them, or any of them, safe for public travel, it shall order the owner or owners of the land abutting thereon, at their own cost and expense, to repair or replace the same in such manner and within such time as it may prescribe, so as to make the same safe and bring them into conformity with the dimensions, styles, kinds, forms, materials, grades and other specifications prescribed by said town council. Notice of such order and of the time limited for compliance with the same shall be given said owner or owners within ten days after it has been made by mailing a copy of the same to their last-known places of abode or by leaving a copy of the same with the agent or person having charge of or occupying such abutting property. If any such owner, owners, agent or occupant fails to comply with such order in the manner and time therein prescribed, the town council may execute such order in the manner therein prescribed at the expense of the town and may assess said expense upon the adjoining property and such owner or owners and collect the same by lien or otherwise. Notice of such assessment shall be given by mail addressed to such owner or owners at their last-known places of abode or by leaving the same with the agent or person having charge of or occupying said adjoining property. Any assessment thus made, with interest at six per cent per annum, shall be a lien upon such property from the time of the execution of such order, which lien may be foreclosed in the same manner as a tax lien, provided a certificate thereof, describing the property on which the lien exists, the amount claimed, the date of the order, the nature of the work for which such lien is claimed and the date of completion thereof, signed by the town manager, shall be lodged with the town clerk within three months after the completion of such work. Such lien shall take precedence over all other liens, mortgages, attachments or other encumbrances except as otherwise provided by law. 
    Sec. 3. Any person aggrieved by any order or assessment made or given under section 1 or 2 hereof may appeal therefrom to the court of common pleas for Hartford County, or a judge thereof when said court shall not be in session, within thirty days after notice of such order or assessment has been given as hereinabove provided. Such appeal shall be a written petition for a review of such order or assessment with a citation attached thereto and returnable not less than twelve nor more than thirty days after its date, and shall be served on the town clerk at least twelve days before the return day. Any number of persons who are similarly affected by any such order or assessment may join in taking and prosecuting such appeal. Such court or judge may, by committee or otherwise, review and revoke, modify, reaffirm or alter such assessment and, if such order is revoked or such assessment reduced, award costs against the town, otherwise against the appellant, and shall issue execution for the amount of such assessment or re-assessment and in favor of either party for costs to be taxed as upon civil process and, after the proceedings have been closed, return the papers connected with the case, except those which the court must retain, to the town clerk, who shall keep them on file. 
    Sec. 4. No person shall construct any sidewalk, curbing, driveway entrance or gutter within the limits of any public street in the Town of Bloomfield without the written authorization or order of the town manager or town council, and any such sidewalk, curbing, driveway entrance or gutter constructed without such written authorization or order may be removed by the town manager or on the order of the town council as an obstruction of the street. 
    Sec. 5. The town council may, by ordinance, prescribe rules, regulations and specifications governing the laying, relaying and repair of sidewalks, curbing, driveway entrances and gutters or any other work within the public streets of the town, may require a permit for doing such work and prescribe the conditions prerequisite to obtaining one, may prohibit the doing of such work except by persons licensed by the town, and may prescribe conditions and qualifications prerequisite to obtaining such license, including the furnishing of bonds in favor of the town.

Chapter 21/2 - ADULT ORIENTED ESTABLISHMENTS 

Sec. 21/2-1. - Declaration of policy. 
    The Town Council of the Town of Bloomfield, Connecticut finds: 
(a)  The operation of "adult-oriented establishments" in the town requires special regulation and supervision by the town to protect, preserve and promote the health, safety and welfare of the patrons of such establishments, as well as the health, safety and welfare of the town's citizens. Further, protecting order and morality, preserving the character and preventing the deterioration of the town's neighborhoods, promoting retail trade, maintaining property values, and ensuring sanitary and safe public places are desirable objectives of the community and its leaders. 
(b)  Statistics and studies performed by a substantial number of cities and towns in the United States indicate that: 
(1)  Large numbers of persons, primarily male, frequent such adult-oriented establishments, especially those which provide closed booths, cubicles, studios and rooms for the private viewing of so-called "adult" motion pictures and/or video tapes and/or live entertainment; and 
(2)  Such closed booths, cubicles, studios and rooms have been used by patrons, clients or costumers of such adult-oriented establishments for the purpose of engaging in specified sexual activities; and 
(3)  Male and female prostitutes have been known to frequent such establishments in order to provide sex for hire to the patrons, clients or customers of such establishments within such booths, cubicles and rooms; and 
(4)  Doors, curtains, blinds and/or other closures installed in or on the entrances and/or exits of such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms which are closed while such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms are in use encourage patrons using such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms to engage in specified sexual activities therein with prostitutes and/or with other persons and/or by themselves, thereby promoting and encouraging prostitution and the commission of specified sexual activities which cause blood, semen, urine, or other bodily secretion to be deposited on the floors and/or walls of such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms, which deposits could prove detrimental to the health and safety of other persons who may come into contact with such deposits; and 
(5)  Booths, studios, cubicles, studios and rooms which are closed while such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms are in use often contain holes that have been cut or smashed out of the walls or other partitioning material. These holes permit the inhabitant of one booth to engage in specified sexual activities with the inhabitant of the adjoining booth, cubicle, studio or room. These so-called "glory holes" promote and encourage specified sexual acts to occur between persons anonymously. Anonymous sexual contact poses a higher risk of spread of communicable diseases, including the AIDS virus and Hepatitis B, and other sexually transmitted diseases. Further, the existence of "glory holes" in booths, studios, cubicles and rooms at adult-oriented establishments provides an increased risk that blood, semen, urine, or other bodily secretions will be deposited on the floors, and/or walls of such booths, cubicles, studios and rooms, which deposits could prove detrimental to the health and safety of other persons who may come into contact with such deposits; and 
(6)  Specified sexual activities often occur at unregulated adult-oriented establishments which provide live adult entertainment. Specified sexual activities include sexual contact between employees and patrons of adult-oriented establishments, and specifically include, "lap dancing," and/or manual or oral touching or fondling of specified anatomical areas, whether clothed or unclothed. Such casual sexual physical contact between strangers may result in the transmission of communicable diseases which would be detrimental to the health of the patrons and employees of such adult-oriented establishments; and 
(7)  The unregulated operation of adult-oriented establishments is associated with an increase in the incidence of sex-related crimes and also has a disruptive effect on the surrounding neighborhood by causing excessive noise, parking problems, the presence of discarded sexually oriented material on residential lawns, and the performance of sexual acts in public places; and 
(8)  The reasonable regulation and supervision of such adult-oriented establishments tends to discourage prostitution, other sex-related crimes, anonymous, high-risk sexual contact and/or high risk unsanitary sexual activity, excessive noise and property devaluation, thereby decreasing the incidence of communicable diseases and sex-related crimes, and thereby promoting and protecting the health, safety and welfare of the employees and the public who patronize such establishments, and protecting the health, safety and property interests of a town and its citizens. 
(c)  The continued unregulated operation of adult-oriented establishments is and would be detrimental to the general welfare, health and safety of the citizens of Bloomfield. 
(d)  The Constitution and laws of the State of Connecticut grant to the town powers, especially police power, to enact reasonable legislation and measures to regulate and supervise adult-oriented establishments in order to protect the public health, safety and welfare. 
(e)  It is not the intent of the town council, in enacting this ordinance, to deny to any person rights to speech protected by the United States and/or State Constitutions, nor is it the intent of the town council to impose any additional limitations or restrictions on the content of any communicative materials including sexually oriented films, video-tapes, books and/or other materials. Further, by enacting this Ordinance, the town council does not intend to deny or restrict the rights of any adult to obtain and/or view any sexually oriented materials protected by the United States and/or State Constitutions, nor does it intend to restrict or deny any constitutionally protected rights that distributors or exhibitors of such sexually oriented materials may have to sell, distribute or exhibit such materials.

(2)  Except as otherwise provided, no person shall erect, construct, change the use of, or construct an addition of more than fifty (50) percent in gross floor area to any building or structure of type I or type II construction which exceeds ten thousand (10,000) square feet in gross floor area, including any portions thereof which may be located below grade, which fails to support adequate radio coverage. For the purposes of this section, the term "building" shall be construed to include parking structures and stairwells. The term "adequate radio coverage" shall be construed to include all of the following: 
a.  A minimum signal strength of one microvolt (-107 dBm) available in ninety-five (95) percent of the area of each floor of the building, including areas below grade if applicable, when transmitted from the Town of Bloomfield Police Department; 
b.  A minimum signal strength of one microvolt (-107 dBm) received at the Town of Bloomfield of Police Department when transmitted from ninety-five (95) percent of the area of each floor of the building; 
c.  The frequency range between 450 and 470 MHz must be supported; and 
d.  A one-hundred-percent reliability factor. 
(b)  Amplification system required. 
(1)  Buildings and structures subject to the requirements of this section which do not provide adequate radio coverage shall be equipped with an internal multiple antenna system with FCC type accepted bidirectional amplifiers as necessary to achieve adequate radio coverage. 
(2)  If any part of the installed system or systems contains an electrically powered component, the system shall be capable of operating on an independent battery and/or generator system for a period of at least twelve (12) hours without external power input. The battery system shall automatically charge in the presence of an external power input. The amplification system, if powered, will be monitored by the building fire alarm system. If the system shifts to auxiliary power as stated above, the building fire alarm system will indicate trouble for that dedicated zone. 
(3)  Any person who constructs or develops a commercial, industrial or office building or structure shall provide two (2) raceways within the walls into which the cable needed to support a multiple antenna system could be laid. Such raceways shall include an opening in the roof, which allows for installation or replacement of an exterior antenna and shall include access to each floor. 
(c)  Testing procedures. 
(1)  Acceptance test procedure. 
a.  Upon completion of the installation of an in-building radio system required pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the building owner shall have said radio system tested in the manner described herein to ensure that overall two-way coverage within the building, including all areas located below grade, is a minimum of ninety-five (95) percent. 
b.  A maximum of two nonadjacent areas on any floor will be allowed to fail the test. The test shall be conducted using a current public safety portable in use, or equivalent, portable radio, talking through the Town of Bloomfield radio system as specified by the authority having jurisdiction and conducted under the supervision of the Town of Bloomfield Chief of Police or designee. The center of a grid area will be located for the test. The radio will be keyed to verify two-way communication to and reception from the Bloomfield Police Department. 
c.  The gain values of all amplifiers shall be measured and the test measurement results shall be kept on file with the building owner so that the measurements can be verified each year during the annual tests. In the event the measurement results become lost, the building owner will be required to repeat the acceptance test to reestablish the gain values. 
d.  Qualifications of acceptance test personnel. All tests shall be conducted, documented and signed by a person in possession of a current FCC license, or a current technician certification issued by the Associated Public-Safety Communications Officials International (APCO), the Personal Communications Industry Association (PCIA), or the National Association of Business and Education Radio (NABER). The building owner shall retain all test records on the inspected premises, and a copy shall be submitted to the Town of Bloomfield Chief of Police. 
(2)  Annual tests. When an in-building radio system is required, it shall be the building owner's responsibility to have all active components of the system, such as amplifiers, power supplies and backup batteries, tested at least once every twelve (12) months. Amplifiers shall be tested to ensure that the gain is the same as it was upon initial installation and acceptance. Backup batteries and power supplies shall be tested under load for a period of one hour to verify that they will properly operate during an actual power outage. If within the one-hour test period the battery exhibits symptoms of failure in the opinion of the testing technician, the test shall be extended for additional one-hour periods until the integrity of the battery can be determined. All other active components shall be checked to determine that they are operating within the manufacturers' specifications for the intended purpose. When possible, the annual test should be scheduled in conjunction with the annual life safety code inspection conducted by the fire department. 
(3)  Field-testing. Public safety personnel, after providing reasonable notice to the owner or his or her representative, shall be permitted to enter onto the property to conduct field-testing to be certain that the required level of radio coverage is present. 
(d)  Modifications. The requirements of this section may be modified upon a written request of the owner when unique or unusual circumstances exist within a building or structure, which make full compliance with this section practically infeasible. Upon a unanimous determination by the town manager, building official and police chief that said circumstances exist and that a lower standard of compliance may be achieved without sacrificing the general intent of the section, a written waiver may be issued detailing the permissible variances. 
(e)  Exemptions. This section shall not apply to residential structures containing three (3) or fewer dwelling units. 
(f)  Violations. Any person violating the provisions of this section shall be fined ninety dollars ($90.00). Each day during or on which a violation occurs or continues shall constitute a separate offense. 
(g)  Conflict of provisions. Any provisions herein that are in conflict with the State Fire Safety Code will be subject to the state regulations.

Such inspection, examination and survey shall be made in a manner that will cause the least amount of inconvenience to said owner or occupant, consistent with an efficient performance of the duties of the enforcement officer. To further ensure that the policy of this article is to achieve compliance through cooperation of owners and occupants, and to ensure that such policy will be successfully maintained, whenever practicable the enforcement officer may provide reasonable advance notice to the owner, the person in charge, and/or the occupants of any planned blanket inspection and any inspections of a routine nature.

    Whenever an owner, occupant or person in charge of a dwelling, dwelling unit or premises shall deny the enforcement officer right of entry for the purpose of inspection, examination or survey, the enforcement officer shall not so enter until he presents a duly granted authorization to enter for the purpose of inspection, examination or survey of such premises. 
    Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude the entry of the enforcement officer at any time when, in his judgment, an emergency tending to create an immediate danger to the public health, welfare, or safety exists; or when such entry by the enforcement officer is requested by the owner, occupant or person in charge of the dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming unit or premises; or when the enforcement officer presents a duly granted authorization to enter for the purpose of inspection, examination or survey of such premises for the purposes hereof. 
    Any owner, occupant, or person in charge of a dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming unit or premises refusing to permit, or impeding, entry of and free access to any part of any dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming unit or premises for the purposes of inspection, examination, or survey under the provisions of this subsection and subsection (a) above shall, upon conviction, be fined not less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as provided in section 12-15 of this Code.

Such records shall be made available by the owner or operator to the appropriate authority for inspection and copying upon request. Such records shall be admissible in any administrative or judicial proceeding pursuant to the provisions of this article as prima facie evidence of the violation or the correction of violations of this article or of applicable rules and regulations pursuant thereto.

Sec. 12-11. - Enforcement. 
(a)  Whenever the enforcement officer determines that conditions exist which cause any dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming unit or premises to fail to meet the minimum standards provided for in this article or regulations pursuant thereto, he shall issue a notice of violation setting forth the alleged failure or failures and requiring that such failures be corrected. The notice of violation shall be put in writing. Said notice of violation shall set forth the alleged violation or violations of this article, or the rules and regulations pursuant thereto, and describe the dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming unit or premises where the violation is alleged to exist or to have been committed. Said notice of violation shall provide a reasonable time for the correction of any violation alleged. Said notice of violation shall then be served upon the owner, occupant or person in charge of the dwelling, dwelling unit, rooming unit or premises by such personal service as shall be in accordance with the laws of the State of Connecticut for the service of process. Such notice may in the alternative, however, be served on said owner, occupant or person in charge by the use of registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or with provisions that the postal service deliver to addressee only.

(Ord. No. 2001-3, § 100-2, 11-26-01) 
Sec. 17-163. - Designation criteria. 
(a)  No road or portion of road shall be designated as a scenic road unless it is free of intensive commercial development and intensive vehicular traffic and unless it has a minimum length of two thousand five hundred (2,500) feet, except that the length of the road may be less if the commission finds that the road segment contains unique scenic features and/or is located between identifiable environmental features and/or intersections. 
(b)  Prior to designating a road as a scenic road, the town plan and zoning commission shall first specifically find that at least one (1) of the following criteria is met: 
(1)  The highway is unpaved;

(2)  Recreational uses; 
(3)  Proximity to open space, agricultural, forest lands, including land that is public nonprofit or privately owned; 
(4)  Notable geologic or other natural features which would benefit from a road's designation as a scenic road.

(Ord. No. 2001-3, § 100-3, 11-26-01) 
Sec. 17-164. - Application procedure. 
(a)  Request for designation. The town plan and zoning commission shall consider a road for designation as a scenic road upon receipt of a request for designation and may itself initiate such a request as herein described. No road shall be designated as a scenic road by the town plan and zoning commission unless a request for designation has been filed with the commission on a form prescribed by it, containing the following information. 
(1)  The name of the road proposed to be designated as a scenic road and a general description of the road or portion of it to be designated, which includes the total frontage of the road section proposed, and the names and addresses of all abutters. The above information shall be shown on a plan at a minimum scale of one (1) inch equals two hundred (200) feet, showing the limits of the proposed designated section of the road. 
(2)  A written description identifying those characteristics of the road which qualify it for scenic road status, including as a minimum but not limited to the criteria set forth in section 17-163 of this article.

(b)  Hearing and decisions. Before designating a road as a scenic road, the town plan and zoning commission shall hold a public hearing in accordance with section 17-166. 
(c)  Rescission. The town plan and zoning commission may rescind the designation of a road as a scenic road in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 17-166, provided that the owners of a majority of the lot frontage abutting the scenic road concur with such rescission and have filed with the town clerk a written statement of approval of rescission, which shall include their names and addresses and the measures lot frontage of each lot along the scenic road. A copy of said written statement of approval of rescission shall be filed with the town plan and zoning commission at the same time as it is filed with the town clerk.

(Ord. No. 2001-3, § 100-4, 11-26-01) 
Sec. 17-165. - Maintenance, alteration and reconstruction. 
(a)  Preservation objective. The town shall maintain its scenic roads in good and sufficient repair and in a safe, passable condition, pursuant to its regular schedule for maintenance of town roads. Routine maintenance, alteration and reconstruction of a scenic road shall be carried out so as to preserve its scenic and rural characteristics, compatible with safe road operations. In the case of natural disaster in which a scenic road becomes impassable or unsafe for public travel, emergency repairs may be made only to the extent needed to restore the scenic road to its pre-emergency condition. 
(b)  Routine road maintenance. Routine road maintenance shall include the removal of hazard, diseased or dead trees, the trimming of tree branches that encroach on the traveled portion of the scenic road below the height needed to allow school buses, road maintenance vehicles and emergency vehicles to pass, the trimming or removal of brush and the removal of boulders or other obstacles that encroach on the traveled portion of the scenic road or block safe sight distance, the necessary trimming for utility lines, the trimming of brush to enhance and protect scenic views, stone walls, mature trees and other characteristics of the scenic road set forth in the decision designating it as a scenic road, the correction of drainage problems, provided that such measures would not otherwise be considered alteration or improvements, the regraveling of scenic roads having gravel surfaces and the resurfacing, restoration and repair of existing paved roadway surfaces. The public works director shall monitor routine road maintenance of scenic roads to ensure compliance with this article. 
(c)  Definition. As used herein, the term "alteration of a scenic road" shall mean all repairs or improvements other than routine maintenance as described in subsection (b) above, or repairs made necessary by natural disaster, as described in subsection (a) above, and shall include any widening or straightening of the right-of-way, the paving of a scenic road having a gravel surface, the removal of stone walls, the removal of mature trees, the regarding of roadside slopes and all other similar improvements. As used herein, the term "reconstruction of a scenic road" shall mean the complete removal of the road surface and/or subsurface for the purpose of reconstructing the scenic road in its entirety, including recycling methods and any extension of the width of the scenic road. Any alteration of a scenic road or reconstruction of a scenic road shall be made in accordance with the following procedures. 
(d)  Procedures. 
(1)  The commission shall hold a public hearing in accordance with the requirements of section 17-166 on any proposal for the alteration or reconstruction of a scenic road, even where the proposal is part of a zoning or subdivision application for which no public hearing is otherwise required. Upon the filing of such a proposal with the town plan and zoning commission, the commission shall ask the director of planning and the town engineer each to submit a report of their views on the proposal and shall consider each report in the process of making the decision. If the decision of the town plan and zoning commission is anything other than approval of the proposal as submitted by the public agency, the public agency may, within fifteen (15) days after the decision has been published in a newspaper having general circulation in the town, file an appeal in writing, with the town council. The town council shall thereafter review the record before the town plan and zoning commission including the public agency proposal, the commission decision and the reasons for the decision as stated in the record and within thirty (30) days after filing of the appeal with it, shall render its decision either affirming, modifying and affirming or overruling and setting aside the decision of the commission. 
(2)  The commission shall hold a public hearing in accordance with the requirements of section 17-166 for any zoning or subdivision application which includes proposals for the alteration of a scenic road or reconstruction of a scenic road as part of the application. The process and timing of both requests shall be conducted simultaneously. The town plan and zoning commission may require the applicant to submit engineering or other technical reports documenting a need for the alteration or reconstruction and evaluating potential alternative solutions. The town plan and zoning commission shall evaluate both the subdivision road standards and the scenic values when considering the application. 
(3)  Proposals for the alteration of a scenic road or reconstruction of a scenic road made by a private applicant, other than those for a subdivision having a public hearing, shall be submitted to the town plan and zoning commission for approval, and the commission shall approve, modify and approve or disapprove any proposal after a public hearing conducted in accordance with the requirements of section 17-166. If it deems it necessary, the town plan and zoning commission may require the applicant to submit engineering or other technical reports documenting a need for the alteration or reconstruction and evaluating potential alternative solutions. The town plan and zoning commission shall evaluate both the subdivision highway standards and the scenic values in considering such proposals for the alteration or reconstruction. 
(e)  Standards for alteration or reconstruction. 
(1)  No alteration of a scenic road or reconstruction of a scenic road (see subsection (3)) shall be made unless the town plan and zoning commission determines that such alteration or reconstruction is necessary to maintain the scenic road in good and sufficient repair and in safe condition for public travel. 
(2)  In determining whether to allow the proposed alteration of a scenic road or reconstruction of a scenic road, the town plan and zoning commission shall take into account the specific safety measures of the proposed change and the overall impact of the proposed change. Any decision by the town plan and zoning commission to permit an alteration of a scenic road or reconstruction of a scenic road shall reflect the least possible damage to the character of the scenic road. If an alteration of a scenic road or reconstruction of a scenic road is approved, the town plan and zoning commission shall specify the following requirements as they relate to scenic values: 
Curves-Curves shall not be eliminated unless they are found to be a hazard. 
Grades-Hills and valleys shall not be destroyed by cuts and fills unless absolutely essential for road safety. 
Widths-A scenic road should only be widened if the town plan and zoning commission finds that the amount of traffic, safe road operations and maintenance needs require such widening. For some rural roads, the amount of traffic that can be handled can be greatly increased by wide bypasses and turnouts, constructed at intervals where they do the least damage to scenic and other values. 
Side slopes-The existing steepness of side slopes is preferable to the reduction of gradient by the extensive removal of soil and rock. This is especially true where the slope is fully stabilized and where it is rich with existing ground cover, shrubs and trees. 
Vistas-Vistas of distinct landscapes shall be preserved by suitable vegetation management techniques. 
Vegetation-Vegetation on the side of the scenic road shall be managed in such a way as to preserve wild flowers, shrubs of ornamental and wildlife values, trees, overarching isolated trees and trees forming a canopy. 
Stone walls-If stone walls or portions thereof must be removed, they shall be rebuilt along the affected portion of the scenic road. 
(3)  The town plan and zoning commission shall assure itself that suitable vegetation management techniques are employed to preserve any tree canopy, shrubs and other vegetation, consistent with the need for clearances for utility lines. 
(4)  The town plan and zoning commission shall not grant an application for alteration or reconstruction of a scenic road where such application is made to accommodate a proposed subdivision or other development unless the commission determines that such alteration or reconstruction will not have a material adverse effect on the characteristics of the scenic road which formed the basis for its designation as a scenic road. 
(5)  Reconstruction criteria. No scenic road may be reconstructed beyond that permitted in accordance with the provisions of section 17-165 of this article, unless the town plan and zoning commission finds that there is no reasonable alternative to the improvement or alteration of the scenic road other than such reconstruction. Such finding shall be based upon approved road construction and safety standards and a finding that the alteration or reconstruction is necessary to maintain the scenic road in good and sufficient repair and in safe condition for travel in accordance with provisions of this section. Before any alteration or reconstruction may be made to a scenic road pursuant to this section, all other requirements and procedures of section 17-166 of this article must be complied with. 
(6)  Rights of landowners. Nothing in this article shall be deemed to prohibit a person owning or occupying land abutting the scenic road from maintaining and repairing the land which abuts the scenic road if the activity is outside the right-of-way of the scenic road. No person shall be denied access to his or her property by driveway or subdivision road, provided that the connection to the scenic road is designed and constructed to safeguard the basis for a scenic road as recorded by the town plan and zoning commission. 
Nothing herein shall prohibit a landowner from permanently removing a portion of a stone wall in order to construct or improve a driveway, or in the case of a subdivision, to connect a subdivision road with a designated scenic road, but these activities must be consistent with these guidelines and are subject to approval of the town plan and zoning commission.

Such hearing shall be held not less that fifteen (15) days nor more than thirty (30) days from the date of the mailing of the notice, provided that the hearing officer shall grant, upon good cause shown, any reasonable request by an interested party for postponement or continuance. The hearing officer may accept, from any person contesting liability, copies of police reports, investigatory and citation reports and other official documents by mail and may determine thereby that the appearance of such person at a hearing is unnecessary. If the person or persons cited otherwise fail to appear, the hearing officer may enter an assessment by default against them upon a finding of: (a) proper notice; and (b) liability under the applicable provision of the ordinances. 
(2)  An original or certified copy of the initial notice of violation issued by the issuing official or police officer shall be filed and retained by the town and shall be deemed to be a business record and evidence of the facts contained therein. The presence of the issuing official or police officer shall be required at the hearing if any interested party so requests. 
(3)  A person wishing to contest liability shall appear at the hearing unless excused from doing so by the hearing officer and may present evidence. The town attorney or a designee thereof may present evidence on behalf of the town. The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing in the order and form and with such methods of proof as that officer deems fair and appropriate. The rules regarding the admissibility of evidence shall not be strictly applied, but all testimony shall be given under oath or affirmation. 
(4)  The hearing officer shall announce the decision at the end of the hearing. If the hearing officer determines that the person is not liable, the matter shall be dismissed, and fines, penalties and fees which may have accrued in connection with the citation shall be rescinded and the determination entered in writing accordingly. If the hearing officer determines that the person is liable for the violation, the appropriate fines, penalties, costs or fees shall promptly be entered and assessed against such person as provided by the applicable ordinances. 
(e)  If such assessment is not paid on the date of its entry, the hearing officer shall send by first class mail, postage prepaid, a notice of the assessment to the person found liable and shall file, not less than thirty (30) days nor more than twelve (12) months after such mailing, a certified copy of the notice of assessment against such person in favor of the municipality with the Clerk of the Superior Court for the Judicial District of Hartford, together with such entry fee as may be required by the superior court. The certified copy of the notice of assessment shall constitute a record of assessment, and within twelve-month period, multiple notices of assessment against an individual may be accrued and filed as one (1) record of assessment. Notwithstanding any other provisions, the hearing officer's assessment, when so entered as a judgment, shall have the effect of a civil money judgment, and a levy of execution on such judgment may issue without further notice to such person. 
(f)  A person against whom an assessment has been entered pursuant to this section is entitled to judicial review by way of appeal in accordance with Section 7-152b of the Connecticut General Statutes, as may be amended from time to time.

A.0 Street Standards
A.1 General
In the layout and design of new streets, maximum efforts are to be made to make the street and its
improvements contribute to increased individual safety, serviceability and livability.
A.2 Intersections
The following criteria shall be adhered to in the establishment of intersections:
a) Number of Streets
No more than two (2) streets shall intersect or meet at any one point to
form a 4-way intersection. The centerline of all streets entering the
intersection shall pas through a single point.
b) Spacing of Intersection
New intersections of all commercial, industrial, and local streets shall
be spaced a minimum of two hundred (200) feet apart measured form
the points of intersection of the centerlines.
c) Angle of Intersection
Wherever practical all streets shall intersect at 90 degrees and no street
shall intersect any other street at an angle less than 75 degrees or more
than 105 degrees.
d) Radii of Intersecting Streets
The radii of intersecting collector streets and local streets shall be a
minimum of twenty-five (25) feet. The radii of intersecting major
collector and arterial streets shall be a minimum of thirty (30) feet.
A.3. Block Dimensions
Intersecting streets shall be laid out at such intervals that block lengths between street lines are not
more than 1,200 feet or less than 200 feet. Special attention shall be given to blocks in industrial
and business zones to provide for access to the lots and areas for parking and truck delivery.
A.4. Design Control
The following criteria shall be followed in the design of streets:
Arterial Major Collector Collector Local
Design Speed 50 MPH 45 MPH 30 MPH 30 MPH
Maximum Gradient 5% 6% 9% 9%

100 feet from the centerline of the intersection. Vertical curves shall be used for all changes in gradient
where the algebraic difference in grades exceeds 0.5 percent. All vertical curves shall be parabolic with a
minimum length of 100 feet.
Roadway centerline tangents, which intersect with an angle in excess of ten degrees, shall be connected
with a horizontal curve. Transition curves and spirals will not be required. Clear visibility, measured along
the centerline shall be provided to meet the minimum stopping sight distance requirements noted above. A
minimum tangent distance between reverse horizontals curves of 100 feet shall be provided on all classes
of streets.
A.5 Side Slopes
Streets in cut or fill shall be provided with slopes not steeper than two (2) feet horizontal to one (1)
foot vertical, or the permanence of the street grade shall be otherwise provided to the satisfaction
of the Town. In all areas where the side slopes are steeper than four (4) feet horizontal to one (1)
foot vertical and slope down from the street, quadrails shall be installed in accordance with the
typical detail sheet (Town of Bloomfield Standard Details). Where new streets abut private
property, the developer must obtain necessary slopw rights when in cut or fill, and these slope
rights shall be shown on the final layout submission to the Commission. The developer shall
investigate the effect of fills on adjacent private property within the slope right area. The
Commission may require the developer to install retaining walls to minimize the extent of cuts and
fills.
The developer shall provide the Town with adequate evidence that no drainage problems will arise
on adjacent property due to construction or fill operation.
B.0 Storm Drainage For Streets
B.1 General
The following items are to be considered in the design of storm drainage systems for new
roads:
a) Design of Conduits
Except where indicated by a special study, conduits will be designed to flow
just full or less than full. Total allowable head water depths on conduits
should normally be restricted to less than 1.2 times the clear height of the
conduits in order to preserve this condition. Conduits designed to flow under
greater heads will require special studies and may require special treatments.
b) Placement of Drainage Structures
The first inlet in a storm drain system shall be located within 350 feet of
roadway high point. Other than the first inlet, all inlet should be spaced a
maximum of 300 feet apart. Drainage structures (catch basins, drop inlets, or
manholes) shall be placed at each grade change along a storm drain, at each
change in horizontal direction and at each junction point of two or more storm
drains.
c) Placement of Conduits
Conduits, except those for underdrain conduit, will normally be laid on straight
alignments, both horizontally and vertically, with structures providing access at
all deflection points or at a junction of two or more lines. In special cases
conduits may be placed on curved alignments but such curvature must not
exceed the manufactures recommendations.
2
d) Minimum Slope
Storm sewers shall have a minimum pitch of 0.5%. The Director of Public
Works may grant variance for this requirement or his/her agent if storm sewers
are designed with a minimum self-cleaning velocity of 3-fett per second with
full flowing pipes.
e) Minimum size of Conduit
Circular conduits of less than 15 inches nominal diameter shall not be used for
the transportation of surface drainage. Conduits providing for the passage of
area drainage from one side of the street to the other shall not be smaller than 18
inches nominal diameter. Pipe arches of equal periphery to the above noted
circular conduits may be substituted where required.
f) Minimum Cover
A minimum cover of three feet shall be provided for all storm drains under
roadway, unless otherwise approved by the Public Works Director.
g) Outlet Structure
All storm drain system outlets shall be terminated with an approved outlet
structure.
h) Diversion of Water from Watershed or Watercourse
The Diversion of drainage from one watershed or watercourse to another is not
permitted unless special studies are presented in all cases of diversion to support
the need, therefore, and to minimize the potential damages which may be
consequent to the diversion.
i) Underdrains
Underdrains shall be installed in all areas where wet conditions prevail or where
directed by the Director of Public Works on his/her agent. Underdrains shall
consist of a trench cut below the elevation of the bottom of the subbase,
containing a suitable perforated or slotted conduits and backfilled will a
previous material. The conduits for underdrains shall be not less than 6 inches
in diameter. Outlets for underdrain conduits shall be connected directly to
drainage structure is available, the outlet conduit shall be terminated with an
approved end wall.
j) Intersections
Inlets shall be installed to properly drain all intersections of new streets and
intersections of new streets with existing Town or State streets.
k) Type of Pipes
Reinforced Concrete Pipes (RCP) Class IV shall normally be specified for storm
drainage system except when fill heights require Class V. Asphalt Coated
Corrugated Metal Pipe (ACCMP) with paved inverts should be used where
clearance is limited by utilities, on grades over 10%, corrugated metal pipes
shall be as suggested by the manufacturers and approved by public Works
depending on fill heights above top of pipe.
l) Ditches
The use of ditches to carry storm water to natural watercourses will not be
allowed except in special cases, and then only with the prior approval of public
Works Department.
3
m) Special Structures
Bridges, box culverts, deep manholes, nonstandard end walls, siltation chambers
and other special structures shall be designed in accordance with good
engineering practices and shall be subject to approval of the Public Works
Department. Bridges and box culverts shall be designed to carry at least full
right of way width of the required street.
n) Easements
Easements at least twenty-five (25) feet in width, offset 10 ft. and 1-5 ft.
respectively on the storm drain, shall be provided for all storm water which will
not be installed in right of ways or lands to be dedicated to the Town.
Easements shall be provided for ditches/channels and shall be sufficient
minimum width to include a ten (10 ) foot access strip in addition to the width
of the ditch/channel from top of bank to top of bank.
o) Private Drains
The Public Works Department shall approve the size and locations of all private
storm drains that connect to the Town storm drain system. The waiver shall
relieve the Town of Bloomfield of any responsibility in the event of any failure
of the storm drainage system. This waiver must be transferred with the deed of
the property to buyers. Rear yard drains and cellar of foundation drains that are
connected to storm drainage system must be shown on the final as-built plan of
the drainage system.
B.2 Estimating Storm Runoff
The following guidelines are made available to assist in the development of the design of drainage
facilities, but the designs themselves should be the product of the application of sound engineering
practices and judgment based on the best available data.
B.2.1 Runoff Determination
The method to be used in determining runoff for drainage areas of less than 200 acres is the
Rational Method.
Q = AIR
Where: Q = Rate of Runoff in Cubic Feet per Second
A = Area to be Drained in Acres
I = Percentage of Impervious of the Area
R = Maximum Average Rate of Rainfall over the Entire Drainage Area in Inches per
Hour, Which may Occur During the Time of Concentration
For drainage areas greater than 200 acres the S.C.S. (solids Conservation Service) TR #55 and/or
TR #20 is to be used.
4
B.2.2 Characteristics of Open Channel Flow
The flow characteristics of open channel flow and conduits for storm drainage should be computed
by the use of the Manning equation:
Q = A 1.486 R 2/3 S1/2
N
Where: Q = Discharge
A= Wetted Area of Conduit
N= Coefficient of Roughness
R = Hydraulic Radius in Feet
S = Slope in Foot per Foot
B.2.3 Design Storm Criteria
All storm drainage facilities shall be designed based on the following storm return frequency
criteria:
a) Drainage System
All drainage systems shall be designed for a storm return frequency of 10 years.
b) Discharge Pipe at Outlet
All outlets shall be designed for a storm return frequency of 10 years.
c) Cross Culverts
All culverts crossing any street shall be designed for a storm return frequency of 25 years.
d) Minor Streams (200 to 1,000 acres)
All minor streams shall be designed for a storm return of 50 years.
e) Major Streams (more than 1,000 acres)
All major streams shall be designed for a storm return frequency of 100 years.
B.2.4 Gutter Flow Analysis
The designer is asked to perform drainage computations to determine catch basin spacing and need
to double basins in roadway sags.
B.2.5 Storm Water System Analysis
The designer is asked to perform drainage computations to determine adequacy of storm water
systems.
B.2.6 Detention Basins
The Commission may require the construction of detention basins for the purpose of controlling
peak discharge from a developed area, upon recommendations by the Department of Public
Works. The storm drainage and stream flow computations shall be sufficient adequacy so that the
Director of Public Works and the Commissions staff can make an assessment of the need for
detention.
Detention basins shall be designed for a storm return frequency consistent with Article B.2.3 and
shall be capable of reducing peak flows for storms with return frequencies ranging from2 through
25 years at a minimum, or as dictated by the Commission.
5
The procedure for computing the outflow from detention areas consists of the development for
synthetic hydrographs and routing of these hydrographs through the detention basin. If a
significant amount of drainage, which is not controlled by the detention, is effective at the site,
composite hydrographs, correlating in time the outflow from the detention basin and the flow from
the uncontrolled, may be required to determine the design discharge applicable at the site.
The method developed by the Soil Conservation Service, United States Department of
Agriculture, for developing synthetic hydrographs and routing these hydrographs through the
detention basins will be used.
The Public Works Department will dictate the types and requirements in the design of detention
basins.
Maintenance roads and easements shall be provided for all permanent facilities. The road shall be
12 feet wide having 12 inches of rolled gravel formed in two equal lifts and surface treated. The
gradient shall not exceed 15%.
The Public Works Department will determine the need for fencing and/or screening the facility.
B.2.7 Erosion and Sedimentation Control
Erosion and sedimentation control measures, as required by the Commission, Public Works, and
the Inland Wetlands & Watercourses Commission shall be installed and/or employed to prevent
soil erosion and resultant sedimentation, particularly as such sedimentation might contaminate
rivers, stream, wetlands, ponds, or create a nuisance to abutting property owners.
Required sedimentation and erosion measures shall be installed prior to the initiation of
construction activities, and maintained or replaced, as necessary, until distributed areas are
stabilized. The Town Engineer may modify sedimentation and erosion control requirements,
particularly when extraordinary climatic or weather conditions should dictate such modifications.
The developer/builder shall employ the development and design standards governing sediment and
erosion control as outlined and illustrated in the following publications:
1. Connecticut Guidelines for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control, The Connecticut
Council on Soil and Water Conservation, January. 1985.
2. Recommendations for Erosion and Sediment Control During Land Use Change, The
Southern New England Chapter, Soil Conservation Society of American, January, 1978.
Temporary or permanent sedimentation structures shall be provided with maintenance
roads and easements, as appropriate. The road shall be 12 feet wide, having 1 ½ inches
of rolled gravel formed in two equal lifts and surface treated. The gradient shall not
exceed 15%. The Public Works Department shall determine the need for fencing and/or
screening the facility.
B.2.8 Hydraulic Data and Submission to the Commission
Whenever there is extensive hydraulic data and calculations being submitted in conjunction with a
development, it is requested that a summary sheet be prepared showing the essential information.

TEDHOW TO USE THESE REGULATIONS
PHILOSOPHY
These Zoning Regulations are intended to guide land use activities in Bloomfield in ways that will:
? protect the public health, safety, and welfare,
? maintain and enhance community character, and
? improve the economic value of property and general welfare of residents.
It is recognized that the appearance of property has a direct bearing on the economic value of that property and also the economic value of adjacent and surrounding properties. The appearance of a single property also has a cumulative effect which can enhance or diminish the beauty of the entire Town, and consequently the values of property elsewhere within the Town.
ORGANIZATION
This set of Regulations has been organized around four main thematic elements. Understanding this organization will help the user quickly locate the regulatory provisions they seek.

(e.g.  Say the market value of a subject parcel at the last revaluation was $100,000, and applying the provided sales/assessment ratio resulted in a market value of the parcel as of the particular date in question equal to $200,000; further, say the portion of the parcel value at revaluation attributable to the main structure was $70,000, then the proportion of the structures value to the parcel value would be 70,000/100,000 = 70 percent; finally, the market value of the structure as of the particular date in question would be equal to $200,000 x 70 percent = $140,000.)

4.1.H Architecture.
The following guidelines shall be incorporated in all new buildings and renovated structures located within the BCD:
1. Create visual variety by avoiding large, long or uninteresting building facades.
2. Incorporate existing architectural features into new structures.
3. Create visual points of interest and pedestrian amenities particularly on large tracts of land.
4. Preserve and reflect historic massing and scale where applicable.
5. Incorporate rooflines of adjacent properties in the design of new buildings.
6. Pitched roof structures are encouraged to reinforce existing prominent buildings.

14. Use natural building materials on the exterior of buildings and avoid aluminum, vinyl or manmade finish systems.
15. Because the BCD possesses an assortment of architectural styles, these standards do not offer any particular architectural style or genre. Rather, they describe basic design elements and relationships that should be adhered to in order to maintain and enhance the architectural fabric that currently exists.
16. Preferred building materials are brick, stone and wood. Well executed cast stone details are also appropriate. Limited use of concrete and concrete block is acceptable if detailed and finished to be compatible with surrounding buildings. Corrugated, split block and cider block exteriors visible by the public are not appropriate.

18. The following roofing materials are encouraged: slate, wood shingles, shakes, and standing seam metal. Asphalt shingles are acceptable and should be neutral to dark in color.
19. Any new or exterior alterations should have significant trim detail to be compatible with surrounding architecture. Renovation should not significantly reduce the level of architectural detail, and new construction should be detailed at a level compatible with the immediate area.
20. Siding of vinyl, asphalt and other synthetic materials are strongly discouraged.
21. Trim details such as rake boards, corner boars and fascia trim should be of a material and dimension appropriate to the overall treatment of the façade.

4.5 BLUE HILLS GATEWAY DISTRICT (GWD).
4.5.A Purpose.
1. Blue Hills Avenue has historically been one of Bloomfields primary access points and will continue to function as one of the Towns major focal points well into the future. With this is mind, development along this corridor must take place in such a manner which will be reflective of the Town and greet visitors in an appropriate manner.
2. The Avenue is also unique in that it contains a business zone abutting a developed residential zone. All development in the Blue Hills Gateway District (GWD) must be designed to protect, enhance, and if possible, serve the adjoining residential neighborhoods.
3. The GWD is intended to encourage the development of lower traffic generating retail service and office activities, upgrading of existing uses to help promote the public health, safety, comfort, convenience, prosperity, amenities, and other aspects of the general welfare of the Avenue and the adjoining residential neighborhood, and whenever possible, to preserve the residential appearance of the remaining houses along the Avenue.
4. Land uses that are permitted in the corridor shall be designed to discourage discernible detrimental influences such as lights, noise, and traffic to the surrounding area and yet project a sense of community and economic soundness.
4.5.B General.
1. Any new construction, substantial enlargement, or change in use in the GWD may be permitted only as a Special Permit by the Town Plan and Zoning Commission.
2. A substantial enlargement shall be defined as any addition which increases the building footprint or total gross floor area by 15 percent or more. A change in use shall occur whenever an existing use in a building or on a tract of land is changed so that a more stringent (e.g. additional parking spaces are required) section of the Zoning Regulations becomes applicable.
4.5.C Bulk Requirements.

5.1 FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT OVERLAY DISTRICT (FMOD)  FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS
5.1.A Statutory Authorization.
These Floodplain Management Regulations, Section 5.1, of the Bloomfield Zoning Regulations, are adopted as part of, thereby amending, the Zoning Regulations of the Town of Bloomfield, Connecticut, as originally adopted March 15, 1950, and subsequently amended at various times, by the Bloomfield Town Plan and Zoning Commission under the authority granted to such Commission by the Connecticut General Statutes and the Charter and Ordinances of the Town of Bloomfield, Connecticut,
5.1.B Finding of Fact.
1. The flood hazard areas of Bloomfield are subject to periodic flood inundation which results in the loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
2. These flood losses are exacerbated by the cumulative effect of obstructions in the floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazards to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damage. Uncontrolled development and use of the floodplains can adversely affect the community.
3. Bloomfield voluntarily participates in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The NFIP is founded on a mutual agreement between the Federal government and each participating community. Local, State and Federal governments must share roles and responsibilities to meet the goals and objectives of the NFIP. The communitys role is of paramount importance. Property owners are able to receive Federally-subsidized flood insurance only if the community enacts and enforces the minimum floodplain regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
5.1.C Purpose.
It is the purpose of these Regulations to regulate floodplain development, promote public health, safety, and general welfare, and minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas through provisions designed:
1. To protect human life and health, and prevent damage to property;
2. To minimize expenditure of public funds for costly flood control projects;
3. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at public expense;

4. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and
5. Prevent or regulate the construction of barriers or obstructions which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
5.1.E Application of These Regulations.
These regulations shall apply to all development in Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA) within Bloomfield. These regulations are effective as of September 26, 2009.
5.1.F Floodplain Management Regulations Defined.
Section 5.1 of the Zoning Regulations of the Town of Bloomfield, Connecticut, as amended, present the standards, requirements, and restrictions governing the management of and development within the Special Flood Hazard Areas, as defined herein, in the Town of Bloomfield; and, as such, are known as the Floodplain Management Regulations for the Town of Bloomfield. Any reference to the Floodplain Management Regulations made in or related to the conduct of business of or relating to the Town of Bloomfield shall mean said Section 5.1 of the Bloomfield Zoning Regulations. As used within this Section 5.1 of the Zoning Regulations, the term Regulations, as may be in appropriate context, shall mean and refer to said Floodplain Management Regulations.
5.1.G Map and Study Made a Part Hereof and Adopted Hereby.
The Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Bloomfield, as defined in Section 2.2, are made a part hereof by reference, and are officially adopted by the Town of Bloomfield with the adoption of these Regulations by the Plan and Zoning Commission.
5.1.H FIRM and FIS Apply.
1. Where Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs), base flood elevations (BFEs), and/or floodway limits have been provided by FEMA on the FIRM and/or within the FIS, then such provided data shall be applicable and have precedence; except, and only to the extent any such exception may be applicable, in particular situations where such data may be incomplete or information used to derive such data may have been rendered inaccurate or superseded by more accurate information.

the provisions associated therewith. In general, the BFE data contained in the FIS shall have precedence over the BFE data shown on the FIRM.
2. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.1.H1, the current FIRM and or FIS information shall be applicable and have precedence in all cases where such current information is more restrictive than any new or subsequent information until such time FEMA issues a map amendment incorporating any such new or subsequent information.
3. As a point of emphasis, however, any area of potential, demonstrable, or historical flooding during a base flood event is subject to regulation hereunder as being located within a SFHA notwithstanding its inclusion as such on the FIRM.
5.1.I Structures and Developments Already In Compliance.
A structure or development subject to regulation under and already in compliance with these Regulations shall not be made non-compliant by any alteration, modification, repair, reconstruction or improvement. No structure, structural feature, or land subject to regulation hereunder shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, modified or structurally altered without the same being in full compliance with the terms of these Regulations and other applicable regulations.
5.1.J Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.
These Regulations are not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where these Regulations and another ordinance, regulation easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions with respect to the purposes of these Regulations shall prevail.
5.1.K Interpretation.
In the interpretation and application of these Regulations, all provisions shall be:
1. considered as minimum requirements,
2. liberally construed in favor of the governing body and/or the purpose of these Regulations, and
3. deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under State statutes.
5.1.L Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.
The degree of flood protection required by these Regulations is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration and research. Larger floods can and will occur on occasion. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These Regulations do not imply or guarantee that land outside the Special Flood Hazard Areas or that uses permitted in such areas will be free from flooding and/or flood damages. These Regulations shall not create liability on the part of the Town of Bloomfield, or any officer or employee thereof, for any flood damages that occur in spite of, as a result of, or in any way associated with reliance on and/or compliance, or lack thereof, with these Regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. The Town of Bloomfield, its officers and employees shall assume no liability for another persons reliance on and/or use of any maps, data or other information provided by the Town of Bloomfield or any officer or employee thereof.
5.1.M Severability.
If any article, provision, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of these Regulations should be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such decision shall not affect the remaining portions of these Regulations, which shall remain in full force and effect; and to this end the provisions of these Regulations are hereby declared to be severable.

5.1.N FEMA Guidance Documents.
FEMA promulgates a number of publications and other materials which may be used for reference and guidance to those required to comply with various aspects of these Regulations. The preferred method for obtaining or otherwise learning about such publications is via the FEMA website.
5.1.O Provisions For Flood Hazard Reduction.
1. Engineering Studies: Any engineering study required in accordance with, or otherwise associated with, these Regulations shall comply with and be subject to the following:
a. Use analyses and other methods appropriate to the purpose of the study, the nature of the proposed encroachment, and the relevant flood characteristics, applying standard engineering practices, and be prepared in accordance with NFIP regulations, requirements, and practices where applicable; (5/24/12)
b. Be documented, summarized, and concluded in a report to be submitted to the Town Engineer;
c. Be performed, reported, and appropriately certified by a Connecticut Registered Professional Engineer;
d. Be conducted, reported, and certified in a manner acceptable to the Town Engineer;
e. Clearly demonstrate and conclude that any subject requirement is being met by the development as proposed; and,
f. Be performed and reported at the expense of the subject developer.
2. Any development shall not increase the flood hazard potential on any other property or person; and the same shall be designed and constructed accordingly. To this end, the Town Engineer may, as deemed appropriate thereby, require the developer to submit an engineering study complying with the provisions of this Section.
3. Regional and local governmental agencies and entities are not exempt from any requirements or provisions of these Regulations.
4. Regulated structures, structural facilities and other development shall be designed and constructed using methods and practices so as to minimize flood damage.
5. Regulated structures and structural facilities shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
6. Regulated structures and structural facilities shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
7. Regulated structures and structural facilities cannot be constructed or located entirely or partially over water unless they are a functionally dependent use or facility.
8. If any portion of a structure or structural facility lies within a SFHA, the entire structure or structural facility is considered to be in the SFHA. As such, the entire structure or structural facility must meet the construction requirements of the flood zone. For emphasis, decks or porches that extend into a SFHA will require the entire structure to meet the requirements for the SFHA.
9. If a structure or structural facility lies within two (2) or more flood zones, then the entire structure or structural facility is considered to be located in the more restrictive zone. As such, the entire structure or structural facility must meet the construction requirements of the more restrictive zone. For emphasis, decks or porches that extend into a more restrictive flood zone will require the entire structure to meet the standards of the more restrictive zone.
10. As a standard, electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, HVAC equipment and ductwork, and other service or utility facilities, and any machinery or utility equipment or connections servicing a structure shall be elevated to or above the base flood elevation to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. This includes, but is not limited to, furnaces, oil or

propane tanks, air conditioners, heat pumps, water heaters, ventilation ductwork, clothes washers and dryers, electrical junction boxes, and circuit breaker boxes. In particular circumstances associated with a non-residential regulated structure where complying with the requirements of this Section 5.1.O10 are demonstrated to the permitting authority, and deemed so thereby, to not be reasonably feasible, then the same may be permitted to be located below the BFE subject to the applicable provisions of Section 5.1.Q2 below.
11. Above-ground storage tanks (oil, propane, etc.), whether located outside or inside of a structure, must either be elevated above the base flood elevation on a concrete pad, or be securely anchored with tie-down straps to prevent flotation or lateral movement, have the top of the fill pipe extended above the BFE, and have a screw fill cap that does not allow for the infiltration of flood water.
12. New development shall be provided with adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards. As a point of emphasis, the area around regulated structures shall be graded such that adequate drainage paths are provided to direct flood waters safely around and away from the subject structure. (Note that this requirement shall be applied with reason with respect to a non-residential structure with a portion of its finished space located below the BFE in accordance with Section 5.1.Q2.)
13. New and replacement public utilities systems and facilities, such as communications, electric, natural gas, sewer, water, etc., shall be designed, located, and constructed to minimize flood damage.
14. New and replacement water supply systems and facilities shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration and inflow of flood waters into the system.
15. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems and facilities shall be designed to minimize or eliminate the infiltration and inflow of flood waters into the system and discharges from the system into flood waters or any stormwater conveyance system.
16. On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
17. The storage of hazardous materials within a SFHA is strongly discouraged. Where hazardous materials are stored within a SFHA, measures should be taken and the utmost care exercised to absolutely minimize the possibility of the stored materials being released as a result of a flood event. Using the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Flood Proofing Regulations as a guide, the following materials shall not be stored within a SFHA in any quantities larger than those associated with normal, periodic household use (as appropriate): acetone, ammonia, benzene, calcium carbide, carbon disulfide, celluloid, chlorine, hydrochloric acid, prussic acid, magnesium, nitric acid, oxides of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sodium, and sulfur.
18. Development that encroaches on a floodway is strongly discouraged; and the same is prohibited unless and until it can be demonstrated that:
a. there is no feasible alternative, and,
b. through a study prepared and documented in accordance herewith, that such encroachment does not increase the water surface elevation within the floodway by any amount (0.00 feet) in any location, onsite or offsite, for the base flood event.
19. For purposes of Section 5.1.O18 above, the definition of development shall be extended to include any modification of a structure or structural feature that alters the dimensions of the same in such a way as may affect the water surface elevation of the floodway.
20. Any development that proposes to introduce or increase an encroachment on a SFHA shall require the developer to submit an engineering study, termed an Encroachment Review Study, complying with this Section that evaluates the effects of such proposed encroachment on water surface elevations and flow velocities within the SFHA during the base flood event. The Professional Engineer that performed the subject study shall submit with the study report an appropriately completed, signed, and sealed SFHA Encroachment Certificate, in a standard form acceptable to the Town Engineer, stating that said Professional Engineer did perform
Page | 76  Bloomfield Zoning Regulations  8.15.2009 (09/09/19)
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 C
the subject study and prepare the subject report and that the findings of the study clearly demonstrate that the requirements for Equal Conveyance and Compensatory Storage, (Sections 5.1.O.21 and 5.1.O.22) are satisfied. Where applicable, effects on the floodway may also be required to be evaluated. (5/24/12)
21. Equal Conveyance: A proposed encroachment into the SFHA resulting from fill or the introduction of, or the footprint expansion to, a Regulated Structure into the SFHA, or work within adjacent land subject to flooding, shall not increase the water surface elevation or flow velocity within the SFHA in any location, onsite or offsite, for the base flood event. (5/24/12)
22. Compensatory Storage: Development shall not reduce the water holding capacity of a SFHA. Any reduction thereof as a result of development shall be compensated for by deepening and/or widening of the floodplain in a volume corresponding to the subject reduction. Compensating storage shall be:
a. Provided on-site, unless an appropriate easement has been obtained from the owner of any impacted property;
b. Provided within and hydraulically connected to, in an unrestricted manner, the same hydraulic reach as where storage will be/has been reduced;
c. Hydraulically comparable and incrementally equivalent to the volume of flood water at each elevation, up to and including the base flood elevation, that will be/has been displaced by the development; and,
d. To this end, the Town Engineer may, as deemed appropriate thereby, require the developer to submit an engineering study complying with the provisions of this Section.
23. As a standard, the alteration and/or relocation of any watercourse within a SFHA is not allowed. Where the particular circumstances associated with a proposed development are such that allowing the same is deemed by the permitting authority to be consistent with the purposes of these regulations and those of the permitting authority, then the same may be allowed, subject to the following:
a. The flood carrying capacity of any portion of a watercourse that is altered or relocated must be maintained; and
b. Sufficient notification must be given to adjacent communities and the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), Inland Water Resources Division prior to any alteration or relocation of any watercourse.
c. The Town Engineer may, as deemed appropriate thereby, require the developer to submit an engineering study complying with the provisions of this Section to assist in determining compliance with requirement (a) hereof.
d. Note that any alteration and/or relocation of a watercourse will require an Inland Wetlands and Watercourses and Watercourses permit as well.
5.1.P Provisions Where BFEs and/or Map Limits Are Incomplete or Inaccurate.
1. In applying SFHA and BFE information under these regulations, Bloomfield may vary from and/or supplement the FIRM, FIS, and other data provided by FEMA in particular situations and particular areas and conditions where/that:
a. The FIRM SFHA limits are in error with respect to actual ground surface elevations;
b. Are designated on the FIRM as Zone A, sometimes herein and elsewhere referred to as Approximate Zone A, in that specific BFEs for the subject area have not been included in the FIS or shown on the FIRM;
c. A watercourse is within a SFHA but does not have floodway limits delineated or otherwise designated for it;
d. Are or may be subject to inundation during the base flood event but are not designated as within a SFHA by the FIS or FIRM;
e. FEMA has notified Bloomfield of and provided to the Town draft revised NFIP data;

f. FEMA has issued advisory flood hazard data following a flood event; or
g. It may be in the public interest to allow increase in flood heights greater than one foot.
2. In such cases, the provisions of this Section 5.1.P, as may be applicable to the particular case, shall be complied with; and the Town Engineer and permitting authority shall have the responsibilities and authorities as applicable and necessary to comply with the provisions of this Section 5.1.P.
3. Sound engineering and regulatory judgment shall be applied, in a conservative sense with respect to the purposes hereof, to all decisions, determinations and actions made or taken hereunder.
4. The Town Engineer shall obtain, from Federal, State, or other source, and including by means of requiring a study complying with the provisions of this Section, review and reasonably utilize any data or other information available that may assist in determining, as applicable and needed, the base flood elevations, floodplain limits, floodway limits, and/or any other factor relevant to meeting the responsibilities, making the decisions and determinations, and complying with the purposes and objectives set forth in these Regulations. The same shall be used as long as it:
a. reasonably reflects flooding conditions expected during the base flood,
b. is not known to be technically incorrect, and
c. represents the best data/information available.
5. The developer of any proposed development is also herby required to comply with the requirements of Sections 5.1.P.3 and 5.1.P4 above, where applicable, in the preparation and modification of any submitted proposal. (5/24/12)

5.1.Q Elevation Requirements for Regulated Structures.
1. Residential Construction: Regulated structures which are residential in nature shall have the bottom of the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the BFE.
2. Non-Residential Construction: Regulated structures which are commercial, industrial, or otherwise non-residential in nature shall:
a. Have the bottom of the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the BFE;
b. Or, in lieu of being elevated, non-residential structures may be dry floodproofed to one foot above the BFE provided that, together with all attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, the areas of the structure below the required elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water; and provided that such structures are composed of structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. A Connecticut-licensed professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review the structural design, specifications, and plans for the subject construction, and shall appropriately certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with acceptable standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this Section 5.1.Q2. Such certification shall be provided to the Town Building Official on the FEMA Floodproofing Certificate, Form 81-65.
5.1.R Enclosures - Fully Enclosed Areas Below the Base Flood Elevation:
1. Regulated structures may have non-basement enclosures under and/or directly adjacent and attached to them that extend below the BFE which may be formed by a foundation or other exterior walls. Any such enclosure is intended to flood and shall be wet-floodproofed.
2. The allowed uses within any such enclosure shall be limited to:
a. Building access;
b. Vehicle parking; and
c. Storage that is limited to that which is incidental and accessory to the principal use of the structure, has low potential for disintegration, discomposure, release of contained materials, or other types of flood damage that may occur in such an environment, and is not susceptible to being transported, in whole or in part, out of the enclosure by floodwaters.
3. Any such enclosure shall be designed to preclude finished living space and to allow for the free entry and exit of flood waters so as to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
4. The design and construction of any such non-basement enclosure shall be in accordance with the requirements set forth in (a) through (i) below:
a. Provide a minimum of two (2) openings to act as hydraulic flood vents allowing for the free flow of flood waters into and out of the enclosure in order to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on the exterior walls of the enclosure. The total combined net area of opening shall not be less than one (1) square inch for every one (1) square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. These hydraulic openings must be located on at least two (2) different walls. Only the area that lies below the BFE shall be used in the calculation of total net area of an opening. If a structure has more than one (1) such enclosure, openings must be installed in the exterior walls of each enclosure so that flood waters can enter directly from the outside. Access doors cannot be considered as an opening, although an access door may contain an opening.
b. The bottom of all openings provided in accordance with (a) above shall be no higher than one (1) foot above exterior finish grade. The exterior finish grade

on at least one (1) side of any such enclosure must be at or below the elevation of the interior floor/ground surface adjacent thereto; and at least one (1) opening must be located on the associated wall and such opening shall have its bottom at the adjacent interior floor/ground elevation; and the floor adjacent to such opening must be at the lowest point in the interior of the enclosure and the whole of the floor of the interior of the enclosure must be designed and constructed so as to drain to such opening; i.e. the enclosure must be designed and constructed to completely and feely drain of floodwaters without the use of floor drains, under drains, sumps, pumps, or other such drainage facilities.
c. The openings provided in accordance with (a) above may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices provided such coverings or devices permit the free entry and exit of flood waters in both directions without any external influence or control such as human intervention, including the use of electrical and other non-automatic mechanical means. The cross-sectional material area of any such covering or device located within the opening area used for the calculation of the total combined net area of opening required hereunder shall be subtracted from and not included in such calculations; i.e. only the effective open space of an opening below the BFE as finally configured, constructed, and finished shall be used for the calculation of the total combined net area of opening required hereunder.
d. Notwithstanding the requirements of (c) above, any opening provided in accordance with (a) above shall be secured in some manner so as to prohibit the movement of rodents or other small wildlife through the opening while maintaining compliance with all other provisions of this Section 5.1.P; and the measures utilized to comply with this requirement shall be appropriately accounted for in the associated total combined net area of opening calculations.
e. The calculations of the total combined net area of opening for any enclosure as required hereunder shall be performed and/or reviewed by a Connecticut-licensed professional engineer or architect; and the same shall be appropriately documented for submittal; and the design and calculations of the openings and appurtenant other design elements as required under (a), (b), and (c) above shall be appropriately certified by a Connecticut-licensed professional engineer or architect and the same submitted as part of the associated permit application.
f. Any such enclosure cannot be used as finished living space. As such, interior walls and floors shall remain unfinished, and carpeting, paneling, insulation, gypsum wallboard (aka drywall or sheet rock), or other such finishings are not allowed to be installed. And, as such, any such enclosure may not be partitioned into separate rooms.
g. Any such enclosure must be built of flood-resistant materials. FEMA provides guidance information regarding acceptable flood-resistant materials.
h. Any such enclosure shall be subject to the provisions of Section 5.1.O21 hereof as if it were a residential structure, regardless of the nature of the use or construction of its attendant main structure. Utilities or service equipment located in this enclosed area, even if elevated above the BFE in the space, may subject the structure to increased flood insurance rates. (5/24/12)
i. As a point of emphasis, a garage that is structurally attached to a residential structure and that has its finished floor elevation below the BFE shall be considered to be an enclosed area below the BFE for purposes of these Regulations; and, as such, shall comply with the provisions of this Section 5.1.R.4.

5.1.S FEMA Flood Variance for Low-cost Accessory Structures:
In some cases, low-cost accessory structures that extend below BFE may be wet-floodproofed and do not have to be elevated or dry floodproofed. Any such structure proposed must obtain a flood variance from FEMA, (not the local zoning variance procedure set forth in these regulations), prior to application for any Town permit that may be required. Notwithstanding any requirements for any such variance as may be granted by FEMA, such structure, upon the granting of such flood variance by FEMA, shall be considered to be an enclosed area below the BFE for purposes of these Regulations; and, as such, shall comply with the provisions of Section 5.1.R.
5.1.T Manufactured (Mobile) Homes and Recreational Vehicles (RVs).
1. In all SFHAs, any manufactured (mobile) homes to be newly placed, undergoing a substantial improvement, or repaired as a result of substantial damage, shall be elevated so that the bottom of the lowest floor is at or above the BFE. The manufactured home must also meet all the construction standards per Section 0. This includes SFHAs outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or on a site in an existing park which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood.
2. All manufactured (mobile) homes within a SFHA shall be placed on a permanent foundation which itself is securely anchored and to which the structure is securely anchored so that it will resist flotation, lateral movement and hydrostatic pressures. Anchoring may include, but not be limited to, the use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.
3. All manufactured (mobile) homes within a SFHA shall be installed using methods and practices which minimize flood damage. Adequate access and drainage should be provided. Elevation construction standards include piling foundations placed no more than ten (1) feet apart, and reinforcement is provided for piers more than six (6) feet above ground level.
4. Recreational vehicles placed on sites within a SFHA shall either:
a. be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, and be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
b. meet all the general standard of Section 5.1 and the elevation and anchoring requirements set forth in this Section 5.1.R for manufactured homes. (5/24/12)
c. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or a temporary jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions. (5/24/12)
5.1.U Standards for Development in Areas of Shallow Flooding (Flood Zones AO and AH).
1. The Special Flood Hazard Areas within Bloomfield may contain areas designated as shallow flooding areas, which are designated on the FIRM as Flood Zone AO or Flood Zone AH. These areas have flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate. In Zone AH, FEMA provides a base flood elevation; while in Flood Zone AO, FEMA generally, though not always, provides a depth of flooding rather than a BFE. In AO and AH flood zones, the following provisions apply:
2. Within Zone AH, as a BFE has been established, all relevant provisions of this Section 5.1 shall apply in the same manner as for Zone AE.

4. Establishment of Permit Authorization. In general, every development subject to regulation under these Floodplain Management Regulations requires a Floodplain Development Permit issued by the Bloomfield Plan and Zoning Commission in accordance with these Regulations prior to the commencement of any development activities within any SFHA; and a Floodplain Management Permit for such purposes in Bloomfield is hereby established. As used within these Regulations, and except where the intent of the use is obviously meant otherwise, the term Permit shall mean and refer to a Floodplain Development Permit; and, any reference to a Floodplain Management Permit shall include a Building Permit as may be issued in accordance with exception a. of this Section 5.1.V.4 below, unless specifically designated otherwise. Permits issued under these Regulations shall expire if actual construction of a permitted structure does not commence within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the permit approval date. There are only two exceptions to the foregoing requirement for Floodplain Management Permit:
a. Where a proposed development within a SFHA only involves repairs and/or improvements to an existing structure and does not involve changing the exterior dimensions of the structure below the BFE, then the permitting of such development may be performed administratively by the Town Building Official through the Floodplain Development section of the Building Permit; and (5/24/12)
b. Where certain insignificant development meeting the criteria as set forth in Article 5.1.V.5 of these Regulations may be exempt from the requirement of obtaining a Floodplain Development Permit subject to, and provided that, all other applicable provisions of these Regulations shall apply to and be complied with during the subject development. (5/24/12)

Director becomes aware that the subject Permit ceases to be in effect, whichever is earlier. The suspension of a Permit does not in any way affect the term of any associated Security.
6. Any such Security may be called by the Director at the request of the Town Engineer when, it is deemed by the Town Engineer and the Director that:
a. The permittee is, to any extent, not complying with the provisions of the Permit and/or these Regulations;
b. Such non-compliance has caused, is causing, and/or has the reasonable potential to cause conditions that are counter to the purposes of these Regulations;
c. The permittee, being responsible for the regulated development associated with a Permit, Permit compliance associated with such development, and the impacts and effects of the efforts, or lack thereof, to perform the same, has had reasonable opportunity to identify and move to correct such non-compliance, irrespective of the status of notification of such non-compliance; and,
d. The permittee is not showing good faith towards remedying the non-compliance and/or the adverse impacts thereof and/or complying with the orders of the Town Engineer, or representatives thereof, associated therewith, and/or the permittee is otherwise not making adequate progress towards the same.
7. In making such determination, the Director and Town Engineer may consider, to varying degrees deemed thereby to be appropriate to the situation, and amongst other factors, in no particular order:
a. The compliance-related history of the permittee with respect to the subject Permit, and, for critical situations, a broader scope may be considered;
b. The scope and magnitude of realized and potential adverse impacts;
c. Time-critical factors; and,
d. The status of the project.
8. For purposes of this Section, not adequately progressing on completing work or conducting activities associated with the Permit it a timely manner with respect to various applicable requirements is considered non-compliance with the permit.
9. For purposes of this Section, the term non-compliance is to be interpreted as generally or specifically as is most in keeping with the purposes of these Regulations.
10. The permittee shall be given a minimum of ten calendar-days notice of the intent of the Director to call a Security prior to the Director actually notifying the surety of such Security that the permittee is in default with respect to the commitments covered by the Security and that the Director is calling for the forfeiture of the Security.
11. The Director and/or Town Engineer, and/or any other Town official and/or administrator acting on behalf of the same, may use the proceeds from the forfeiture of a Security in any manner deemed thereby to be in keeping with the purposes of these Regulations with respect to the subject default and any potential or realized adverse effects associated therewith, allowing for the consideration of the amount of funds available, as well as to cover any expenses incurred in association with the process of obtaining the forfeiture of the Security. Such uses may include, but not be limited to, removal, in whole or in part, of any obstruction within the SFHA that is not in compliance with the subject Permit, expenses associated with completion of all or any part of the improvements associated with the subject development, stabilization and/or restoration of graded and damaged areas, construction of improvements not contemplated in or redesigned from the original plans as may best suit the current situation, repairs, design, bidding, testing, evaluation and analysis, professional consulting, and financial and legal services. Proceeds may be applied to events, actions, improvements, and work that are located off-site as well as on-site, are of a temporary as well as a permanent nature, that occur or occurred at any time subsequent to the Director becoming aware of the subject default, and that were

incurred by the Town of Bloomfield acting on the Directors and/or Town Engineers behalf, including staff and equipment time.
12. Nothing herein shall be construed to in any way limit or restrict the Town of Bloomfield, Acting through the Director of Planning, from pursuing any legal remedy afforded it to recover damages for expenses incurred by it in any way associated with the default of a permittee with respect to the permittees obligations and commitments associated with a Permit.
5.1.Y Appeals and Variances.

4. Considerations for Granting of a Variance for Floodplain Development. In addition to other considerations set forth in Section 9.11 of the Zoning Regulations, the Zoning Board of Appeals in making determinations on any application for variance to any provision of these Floodplain Management Regulations shall consider:
a. The requirements, standards, and purposes specified in other sections of these Regulations.
b. The input and opinion of the Town Engineer in respect to how the subject variance request relates to the requirements, standards, and purposes specified in these Regulations.
c. All technical studies, evaluations, and information as may be relevant to the subject variance request.
d. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
e. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
f. The susceptibility of the proposed development and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
g. The importance of the services provided by the proposed development to the community;
h. The necessity of the facility to waterfront location, in the case of a functionally dependent facility;
i. The availability of alternative locations, on-site or off-site, not subject to flooding or erosion damage for the proposed use, or the offending portion thereof; (5/24/12)
j. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
k. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;
l. The safe access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
m. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects thereof; and
n. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges.
5. A variance shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief considering the flood hazard; and in the instance of a historical building, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building and not to result in the loss of historic designation for the building.
6. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the subject structure or development will be permitted to be constructed not totally in compliance with these Regulations, and, therefore, probably not in compliance with NFIP regulations; and that, as such, the cost of flood insurance may be set or adjusted commensurate with the increased risk resulting from such noncompliance.

5.2 TALCOTT MOUNTAIN OVERLAY DISTRICT (TMOD).
5.2.A Purpose.
1. The purpose of the Talcott Mountain Overlay District (TMOD) is to carefully monitor development along the Talcott Mountain Range in order to determine whether public services (such as fire, ambulance, and public works) can be reasonably provided, to minimize soil erosion and sedimentation, and to minimize adverse visual impacts on the character of the community.
2. It is not the intent of the TMOD to prohibit or preclude development in designated areas. Rather, the TMOD is intended to establish a process whereby property owners interests in capitalizing on scenic views or other assets can be balanced with the communitys desire to provide a reasonable level of services and to protect environmentally sensitive steep slopes and hillsides from inappropriate development.
5.2.B General.
1. The extensive and essentially undisturbed Talcott Mountain Range is a defining feature of Bloomfield.
2. Experience in other communities has shown that, if these resources are not protected, insensitive development of ridgelines and steep slopes can adversely affect the availability of public services, harm important natural resources, and detract from community character.
3. Because of their steepness and prominent visibility, the areas within the TMOD need stricter standards to protect them from excessive or inappropriate development.
4. These standards should strike an appropriate balance between the use of private property and the Commissions responsibility to protect the public health, safety and welfare, the integrity of the steep slopes, and the scenic views within the community.
5.2.C Delineation.
1. The TMOD, as delineated on the Zoning Map, shall be superimposed on underlying zoning districts and the standards in this Section shall apply in addition to the requirements of an underlying zoning district.
2. If there is a conflict between the provisions listed below and the underlying zoning district or other Regulations, the more restrictive provisions shall apply.
5.2.D Permitted Uses.
1. Authorized Without Zoning Signoff. The following uses are authorized within the Overlay Zone subject to the requirements of these Regulations in the underlying zone:
a. Open space uses which do not require moving, removing or otherwise altering the position of the earth, stone, sand, gravel, or water.
b. Game management, fishing, hunting (where permitted), camping and picnicking, hiking, and other passive recreational activities.
c. Maintenance, repair, or reconstruction of existing public ways or bridges.
d. Public utilities.
2. Authorized by Special Permit. Other uses and structures shall only be allowed within the TMOD as a Special Permit and only to the extent permitted in the underlying zone. This procedural requirement is intended to ensure that activities are conducted in ways that avoid or minimize adverse impacts in these significant natural and aesthetic resource areas.

5.2.E Special Permit Considerations.
In deciding upon a Special Permit application in the TMOD, the Commission shall, in addition to the criteria specified in 9.4.D, consider the following:
1. The extent to which public services (such as fire, ambulance, and public works) can be provided at all times and in all seasons to current and future owners of the property.
2. The extent to which any proposed activity will cause erosion or slipping of soil, or cause sediment to be discharged including whether:
a. the stability of soils will be adequate to support any proposed construction, landscaping, agricultural use, or similar activities.
b. the natural stability of the soil on the site has been used to determine the proper placement of structures and other development within the steep slope area.
c. all construction shall be accomplished in conformance with the erosion prevention provisions of the Connecticut Guidelines for Erosion and Sediment Control, as amended.
d. such operation will occur with an acceptable conservation plan, so that it will not leave an objectionable scar on the landscape.
e. The extent to which existing vegetation will help to retain the stability of the slopes and soils including whether:
f. plant life located on the slopes outside of the minimum area that needs to be disturbed for carrying on approved development will be retained.
g. plants or other acceptable ground cover will be re-established in the disturbed area immediately upon completion of development activities to maintain the natural scenic characteristics of any steep slope. The extent to which storm water drainage will be designed and located to ensure slope stability and not:
(1) cause erosion or siltation,
(2) contribute to slope failure,
(3) pollute groundwater, or
(4) cause damage to, or flooding of, property.
h. The extent to which care will be taken to protect scenic views, scenic vistas, scenic roads, and unique aesthetic features such as prominent ridgelines, from damage, obstruction or other degradation.
i. The extent to which there is an alternative location for the proposed development on that portion of the site not containing steep slopes or an alternative location on that portion of the site having fewer impacts on sensitive resources

a. If the parcel abuts existing public open space which is equal to or larger than the size of the parcel the density may be increased to no more than six (6) dwelling units per acre. If the parcel abuts public open space which is smaller than the parcel, the density may be increased to no more than five (5) dwelling units per acre. No part of any parcel designated as public open space may be utilized in this manner for more than one (1) PLR or other multi-family development.
b. The parcel is of such a location and character that the development within its boundaries will not be readily apparent to existing or potential single-family development in the neighborhood or from public roads so that the impact, in the judgment of the Commission, will be limited to the increase in traffic resulting from the development.
2. Of the total dwelling units approved, at least 50 percent must have net inside living space floor areas equal to or greater than 1,200 square feet and an additional 25 percent must be equal to or greater than 1,000 square feet.

5.4.G Establishment of District.
1. The Commission shall establish the PLR by approving a Master Plan in accordance with Section 9.7, which while not intended to be a substitute for detailed documentation associated with a site plan, provides sufficient information to determine whether the proposal is in conformance with Section 5.4.A and the Plan of Conservation and Development. Such adoption shall constitute a Zoning Map Amendment in accordance with Section 9.7 of these Regulations.
2. District Eligibility. The following characteristics are required for a site to be eligible for the PLR designation:
a. No PLR shall be permitted unless it is on or within 300 feet of an arterial or collector road as defined by the Plan of Conservation and Development. Where peculiar and distinctive circumstances exist, if a principal means of access to an arterial or collector road can be achieved, the Commission may increase the distance requirement, but in no case shall the proposed district be more than 2,000 feet from an arterial or collector road.

5.6 DESIGN DEVELOPMENT ZONE (DDZ) and (DDZ-II). (04/11/19)
5.6.A Purpose.
1. Intent. The creation of a combined work, service, shopping, retail and residential environment that promotes the maintenance of quality open space, reduces the traffic generation that occurs when the uses are separated, enhances the quality and proximity of facilities to employees and retains the character of an area and its suitability for particular uses is beneficial because it will reduce traffic, pollution and congestion which would arise from disparate and piecemeal development and will provide an enhanced living and work environment for the residents of the Town.
2. General. The DDZ and DDZ-II will be governed by a Master Plan in accordance with these regulations. The Master Plan will be subject to review and approval by the Commission as a Zoning Map Amendment, subject to a public hearing and the terms and conditions of these regulations. The Master Plan requires certain fluidity, and as such, may change over time; but any substantial and material change would be subject to the same review and public hearing procedures as the original Zoning Map Amendment. Once enacted, the DDZ and DDZ-II will supersede all pre-existing zoning, and any development on the zoned property will be subject to the new district.
5.6.B Bulk Requirements.

not require any additional approval other than site plan approval or modification as provided for in subsection 2 above.
4. Notwithstanding the requirements set forth above, a change in a land use from one (1) use to another within the same land use type category shall not be deemed a material change of an approved DDZ or DDZ-II. Such a change shall be subject to site plan approval as provided for in subsection 2 above. In addition, the addition of or modification to a Category 8 land use type accessory use shall not be deemed a material change of an approved DDZ or DDZ-II. Such changes shall be subject to site plan approval or modification as provided for in subsection 2.
5. In addition to the foregoing, if the Commission determines that the site plan application submitted by the applicant, although it complies with the criteria established in the Table, differs substantially from the illustrative plan by virtue of increasing the height of a building on the site, increasing/decreasing the number of buildings on the site, substantially changing the internal traffic pattern of the site or substantially modifying the layout of the buildings on the site, then the Commission, in reviewing and approving the application, may make modifications to the proposed site plan to address issues raised by the changes from the illustrative plan, such as increasing the amount or type of buffering and/or landscaping required.
5.6.J Design Requirements.
1. Building Height Adjustments: Buildings may not exceed four stories in height, except that where, in the sole discretion of the Commission, topographical considerations permit a modification in this requirement and negative impacts on surrounding properties can be minimized, the Commission may authorize an increase in the building height, but in no case may the height of any building, from the ground to top of construction measurement exceed 90 feet in a DDZ or 60 feet in a DDZ-II. In those instances where building heights in excess of four stories are requested, a corresponding reduction in impervious surface, such as providing for structured parking, shall be considered. Structured parking facilities located primarily underneath a building and which are at least partially located below the finished grade of the adjoining ground shall not be deemed a story for purposes of calculating the height of a building.
2. Consolidated Development. Where a contiguous area in Business, Industry, or Professional Office is in multiple ownership or is composed of two (2) or more parcels, it may, at the option of the Commission, be developed under a single site plan with height, area, and yard requirements governing the boundaries of the entire parcel so developed. Where individual parcels are developed individually, height, area and yard requirements shall apply to each parcel, unless otherwise provided in these regulations.
3. Landscaping.
a. The applicant shall provide landscaping within a DDZ or DDZ-II in areas of transition of uses or in areas where the DDZ or DDZ-II abuts a residential district, the purpose of which shall be to screen the more intense or commercial uses from the less intense or residential uses.
b. Where an application is located in lands previously or naturally landscaped, such as an estate, every effort should be made to preserve the original landscaping.
c. Circulation. No interior street shall be less than 24 feet in width. The Commission may, where in its judgment traffic circumstances merit, require primary streets to be designed and constructed in conformance with the Town of Bloomfield road specifications. Curbs and sidewalks may be required if the Commission deems them necessary.

10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 C
4. Utilities and Public Improvements.
a. Public water and sewage shall be provided, except that alternate water and sewage disposal systems may be permitted by the Commission upon favorable recommendation of the West Hartford/Bloomfield Health District.
b. Public improvements, such as traffic improvements, drainage improvements, water and sewer improvements, utility installation and similar improvements may be phased in as distinct phases of an approved DDZ or DDZ-II master plan are implemented. Each site plan submitted pursuant to an approved DDZ or DDZ-II master plan shall state specifically what, if any, portion of the public improvements are to be constructed in connection with such site plan and shall contain such information necessary to confirm that the improvements to be constructed will be adequate to support the development set forth in the site plan.
5.6.K Subdivision into Lots.
1. A DDZ or DDZ-II may be subdivided into lots by an applicant in accordance with the requirements of the Bloomfield subdivision regulations.
2. The requirements that applied to the site prior to the subdivision shall remain in force and apply after the subdivision; however, the individual lots may differ from the standards for land use area coverage, impervious surface, yards and other requirements established in the Table, provided that each land use area, as a whole, conforms to the standards established in the Table.
3. As a condition of such subdivision, the subdivision map and any deeds delivered in accordance therewith shall designate for each lot the requirements applicable to each lot, such as maximum square footage of building area, maximum impervious surface, open space requirements and parking spaces, the total of which for the lots in any given land use area shall not exceed the total set forth in the Table for such land use area.
4. Such designation of the applicable requirements may be modified by the property owners at any time with the consent of all property owners involved in the redesignation.
5. After such subdivision, if any site plan application is submitted which proposes to shift requirements between lots, then the consent of the owner(s) of any lot(s) to or from which a requirement will be shifted must be submitted to the Commission with the application.
6. The owner of any lot in a DDZ or DDZ-II shall have the right to submit an application to modify the DDZ as set forth in Section 5.6.I provided that the same does not impose additional obligations on any other lot in the DDZ or DDZ-II unless consented to by such lot owner, does not increase or decrease the bulk and area requirements applicable to the other lots in the DDZ or DDZ-II unless consented to by such lot owner(s) and does not render the DDZ or DDZ-II, as a whole, in noncompliance with the requirements of the Regulations.
7. The foregoing requirements shall also apply to any division of land in a DDZ or DDZ-II into lots, which division is not considered to be a subdivision or resubdivision under the Connecticut General Statutes or the Bloomfield subdivision regulations.
5.6.L Buffers.
1. Side and rear yards which adjoin a residential district shall contain a buffer yard meeting or exceeding the requirements of the landscaped buffer yard for all uses in the DDZ or DDZ-II, in accordance with Section 6.1.
2. Where there is a conflict between the rear and/or side yards and the buffer yard requirements, the more stringent yard requirements shall apply.
3. Minimum Buffer Yard Width: 25 Feet

It is the goal of the Bloomfield Town Plan and Zoning Commission to minimize the impact of parking facilities on the character of the town and the impact of parking facilities on stormwater from impervious surfaces.
6.2.B General Requirements.
1. On any lot which is hereafter developed for residential, business, industrial, hotel or institutional use there shall be provided adequate space suitably located on the lot for parking, loading and unloading of goods and materials.
2. The minimum amount of parking and loading facilities required for any property shall be determined by applying the standards of this Section to the actual and proposed uses and when the requirements result in a fractional number, the minimum requirement shall be rounded up to the next whole number.
3. Where different uses occur on a single parcel of land, the parking and loading spaces to be provided with respect to such parcel shall be the aggregate of the requirements for each such use. However, an applicant may request shared parking as provided by Section 6.2.H.
4. Except as may be provided in Section 6.2.H, all required parking spaces shall be maintained for the exclusive use of residents, patrons, employees or tenants of the building(s) on the site and shall not be used to meet the parking requirements of any other use.
5. Any parking rights acquired from another parcel shall be recorded in the land records in the deed of each parcel involved in such agreement.
6. Any change of use between spaces of retail, service, restaurants, and first floor office space for existing uses that have been approved by a site plan application and require an additional staff or Commission approval for the change of use, shall be afforded some flexibility in the application of the requirements of Section 6.2.D (Number of Spaces Required). Strict compliance with Section 6.2.D is not required provided the applicant can demonstrate that there is adequate parking on the site, or staff or the Commission can determine that there is adequate parking on site and full compliance will not result in any threat to public health, safety, and welfare.)

6.4 GRADING.
6.4.A Purpose.
This Section is intended to control soil disturbance (including removal of trees and vegetative ground cover), excavation, site grading, and drainage changes associated with building demolition, building construction, and site development in order to:
1. protect the public safety and general welfare;
2. prevent adverse impacts to other property due to erosion, sedimentation, and increases in storm water runoff;
3. prevent sedimentation of public and private streets;
4. prevent sedimentation of public storm sewer and drainage systems;
5. reduce the risk of flooding caused by increased runoff and sedimentation of drainage channels, wetlands, and watercourses; and
6. protect water quality by reducing the risk of sediment pollution of reservoirs.
6.4.B Removal of Trees or Vegetative Ground Cover.
1. The Commission finds that trees and other vegetative ground cover play an important role in controlling erosion by: protecting the soil surface from the impact of falling rain; holding soil particles in place; enhancing the soils capacity to absorb water; slowing the velocity of runoff; removing subsurface water between rain falls through the process of evapo-transpiration; and improving infiltration rates.
2. Therefore, for purposes of this Section, clear-cutting or removal of trees and other vegetative ground cover, regardless of whether stumps and root systems are removed, shall be considered an erosion factor equivalent to grading and other forms of soil disturbance, and references in this Section to soil disturbance and/or grading shall include clear-cutting or removal of trees and vegetative ground cover.
6.4.C Applicability.
Within the Town of Bloomfield, there shall be no excavation, grading, or other soil disturbance (including removal of trees or vegetative ground cover) except as herein provided. The occurrence of any off-site sedimentation, flooding, or erosion caused by excavation, grading and/or soil disturbance is prohibited and shall be grounds for enforcement action.
6.4.D Other Approvals May Be Required.
1. Any approval or exemption under this Section does not relieve any person from having to obtain any other approvals that may be required, such as for:
2. Regulated activities under the Town of Bloomfield Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Commission Regulations;
3. Activities within a floodplain area;
4. Activities regulated by other local, State, or Federal agencies.

7.10 CONSERVATION DEVELOPMENT.
7.10.A Purpose.
The purpose of this section is to permit flexibility in residential land development by allowing for a variation in lot area in the R-80, R-40, R-30 districts without increasing the density permitted within the district in which the property is located.
7.10.B Intent.
It is the intent of these regulations that no more dwelling units be permitted than that permitted by reasonable development of the original district. The Conservation Development use provides opportunities to increase open space, protect water quality by reducing impervious surfaces and to enhance community character through tree protection, farm land protection and other means.
7.10.C Development Options.
The Conservation Development use can be developed as a subdivision with roads built to Town standards or as a common interest community with private driveways.
1. Subdivision of Land. The Town Plan and Zoning Commission may permit an Conservation Development wherein the individual units are subdivided into lots. In the case of a subdivision, a minimum required yard (side, front and rear) of 15 feet shall be provided for each lot. There is no minimum lot size or frontage associated with a Conservation Development proposal.
2. Common Interest Community. The Town Plan and Zoning Commission may permit a Conservation Development wherein the land and common facilities shall be under single common ownership, in which case individual lots and yards shall not be required; however, no principal structure shall be within 30 feet of another structure. The Commission shall determine which of the other requirements and conditions of this section shall be applicable. A proposal under the Common Interest Community option shall not constitute a subdivision under the provisions of the General Statutes if no new lot is created.
7.10.D Permitted Residential Densities.
1. The maximum number of lots to be permitted on a given tract of land is determined by reducing the total acreage of the tract by 15 percent for street right-of-way, and by dividing the remaining developable area by the minimum lot requirements for the zoning district in which the tract is located.
2. Land utilized by utilities or others for easements for major facilities such as electric transmission lines and water mains, where such land is not available to the owner for development, shall not be considered as part of the gross acreage in computing the maximum number of lots to be permitted under this Section.
3. The Commission may increase the number of lots permitted by the above formula when in their judgment the principles of these regulations are met, the land is better used, or housing and development goals of the Plan of Conservation and Development merit the increase. In no case, however, may the increase be greater than 20 percent of the formula calculation.

1. The balance of land not contained in the building lots, or utilized by street, driveway or unusable utility rights-of-way, shall be of such a condition, location, size and shape as to be open space. In no case shall the dedicated open space be less than 50 percent of the total area of the subdivision. The use of the land set aside as open space shall be approved by the Commission and such use shall be noted on the record subdivision map.
2. The open space land shall be either:
a. deeded to the Town in an acceptable condition,
b. established legally as part of a homeowners association, or
c. deeded to a land trust.
3. If the land is deeded to the Town, no mylars can be filed or any building permit shall be issued until the land is accepted by the Town Council. The property deeded to the Town shall remain as open space in perpetuity.

In such legal instruments, provisions shall be made for the adequate maintenance of the areas set aside as open space and further provide the necessary safeguards and conditions to carry out the purposes contained in this section of the regulations. In the event that the homeowners association fails to maintain the open space, provisions shall be made for the Town of Bloomfield, its agents, servants and employees, to enter upon such open space, without liability, in order to remove or cause to be removed anything, object or condition which may be deemed to be a nuisance or in the nature of a nuisance. Within such open space, no buildings may be erected without the express approval of the Commission and no change in the

8.1.A Purpose.
1. Within the districts established by this regulation or any amendments that may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures and uses of land and structures which were lawful before this regulation was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this regulation or future development.
2. It is the intent of this regulation to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival.
3. Such uses are declared by this regulation to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. It is further the intent of this regulation that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended if such a change increases the nonconformity, nor shall they be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
4. A nonconforming use of a structure or land, or of a structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this regulation by attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses of a nature which could be prohibited generally in the district involved.
5. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this regulation shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of the adoption or amendment of this regulation.
8.1.B Nonconforming Lots of Record and in Subdivisions.
1. In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this regulation a single-family dwelling and accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this regulation. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or lot frontage, or both, generally applicable in the district, provided however, that yard dimensions and other requirements for area or lot frontage, or both, shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located.
2. Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the Zoning Board of Appeals. However, if adjoining property was in the same ownership as the lot in question at the time of the adoption of the Zoning Regulations (March 15, 1950), the lot must conform in area and frontage to the present requirement of the district in which it is located, if the combination of both parcels would result in a conforming lot. The owner of any lot in a subdivision heretofore validly approved or in the process of approval at the time of the adoption of this regulation may use the lot for the erection of or alteration of a single-family dwelling.

8.1.C Nonconforming Uses of Land.
Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this regulation, lawful use of land exists that is made or no longer permissible under the terms of this regulation as enacted or amended, such use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
1. No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged, increased or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this regulation.
2. No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part of any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this regulation.
8.1.D Nonconforming Structures.
Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this regulation, a lawful structure exists that could not be built under the terms of this ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards or other characteristics of the structure or by its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
1. No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity.
2. Should such structure be destroyed by natural cause or damaged, it may be repaired or replaced to an extent which does not increase the nonconformity. If such repair or replacement is not accomplished within 18 months, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this regulation.
3. Should such structure, for any reason, be moved any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved.
8.1.E Nonconforming Use of Structures.
If, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this regulation, a lawful use of a structure, or of a structure and premises in combination, exists which use would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this regulation, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful subject to the following provisions:
1. No existing structure, devoted to a use not permitted by this regulation in the district in which it is located, shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered in a manner which increases the nonconformity except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located.
2. Any nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the Town Plan and Zoning Commission, either by general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the Commission may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the provisions of this regulation.
3. Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which such structure is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
4. When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for one year, the structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformance with the regulations of the district in which it is located.

2. Appropriate Improvements. a. The design elements of the proposed development will be attractive and suitable in relation to the site characteristics, the style of other buildings in the immediate area, and the existing and probable future character of the neighborhood in which the use is located. b. The location, nature and height of buildings, walls, and fences, planned activities and the nature and extent of landscaping on the site will be such that the use shall not hinder or discourage the appropriate development and use of adjacent land and buildings or impair the value thereof. c. The proposed use or activity shall have no adverse effect upon the neighboring area resulting from the use of signs, exposed artificial lights, colored lights of any nature, flashing lights, loudspeakers or other noisemaking devices. d. In cases where it is proposed to convert a structure designed and built originally for other uses, the structure is adaptable to the proposed use from the point of view of public health and safety.
3. Suitable Transportation Conditions. a. The design, location and specific details of the proposed use or activity shall not adversely affect safety in the streets nor unreasonably increase traffic congestion in the area nor interfere with the pattern of vehicular circulation in such a manner as to create or augment unsafe traffic conditions. b. Parking area or areas will be of adequate size for the particular use, shall be suitably screened from adjoining residential uses, and entrance and exit drives shall be laid out so as to prevent traffic hazards and nuisances. c. Streets and other rights-of-way shall be of such size, condition and capacity (in terms of capacity, width, grade, alignment and visibility) to adequately accommodate the traffic to be generated by the particular proposed use.
4. Adequate Public Utilities and Services. a. The provisions for water supply, sewage disposal, and storm water drainage conform to accepted engineering practices, comply with all standards of the appropriate regulatory authority, and shall not unduly burden the capacity of such facilities. b. The proposed use or activity shall provide easy accessibility for fire apparatus and police protection and is laid out and equipped to further the provision of emergency services.

10.3.C Bond Initiation and Term.
1. Should the performance bond not be posted within 180 days of the Commissions approval, the site plan approval shall become null and void. The Commission may grant, for good cause, an extension of the established time limit if, in its opinion, unusual circumstances prohibit the posting of the bond within the required timeframe. The performance bond shall be posted prior to the Towns issuance of a Permit to Develop and a building permit.
2. A performance bond shall remain in force until all of the terms and conditions of the subject Permit have been successfully met, or six (6) months beyond the date the Town Planner becomes aware that the subject Permit ceases to be in effect, whichever is earlier. The suspension of a Permit does not in any way affect the term of any associated Security.
10.3.D Project Performance
1. Any such bond may be called by the Town Planner at the request of the Town Engineer when, it is deemed by the Town Engineer and the Town Planner that:
a. The permittee is, to any extent, not complying with the provisions of the Permit and/or these Regulations,
b. Such non-compliance has caused, is causing, and/or has the reasonable potential to cause conditions that are counter to the purposes of these Regulations,
c. The permittee, being responsible for the regulated development associated with a Permit, Permit compliance associated with such development, and the impacts and effects of the efforts, or lack thereof, to perform the same, has had reasonable opportunity to identify and move to correct such non-compliance, irrespective of the status of notification of such non-compliance, and
d. The permittee is not showing good faith towards remedying the non-compliance and/or the adverse impacts thereof and/or complying with the orders of the Town Engineer, or representatives thereof, associated therewith, and/or the permittee is otherwise not making adequate progress towards the same.
2. In making such determination, the Town Planner and Town Engineer may consider, to varying degrees deemed thereby to be appropriate to the situation, and amongst other factors, in no particular order:
a. the compliance-related history of the permittee with respect to the subject Permit, and, for critical situations, a broader scope may be considered,
b. the scope and magnitude of realized and potential adverse impacts,
c. time-critical factors, and,
d. the status of the project.
3. For purposes of this Section, not adequately progressing on completing work or conducting activities associated with the Permit it a timely manner with respect to various applicable requirements is considered non-compliance with the permit.
4. The term non-compliance is to be interpreted as generally or specifically as is most in keeping with the purposes of these Regulations.
5. The permittee shall be given a minimum of ten calendar-days notice of the intent of the Town Planner to call a Bond prior to the Town Planner actually notifying the surety of such Security that the permittee is in default with respect to the commitments covered by the Security and that the Town Planner is calling for the forfeiture of the bond.
6. The Town Planner and/or Town Engineer, and/or any other Town official and/or administrator acting on behalf of the same, may use the proceeds from the forfeiture of a bond in any manner deemed thereby to be in keeping with the purposes of these Regulations with respect to the subject default and any potential or realized adverse

10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 C
effects associated therewith, allowing for the consideration of the amount of funds available, as well as to cover any expenses incurred in association with the process of obtaining the forfeiture of the bond. Proceeds may be applied to events, actions, improvements, and work that are located off-site as well as on-site, are of a temporary as well as a permanent nature, that occur or occurred at any time subsequent to the Town Planner becoming aware of the subject default, and that were incurred by the Town of Bloomfield acting on the Town Planners and/or Town Engineers behalf, including staff and equipment time.
7. Nothing herein shall be construed to in any way limit or restrict the Town of Bloomfield, Acting through the Town Planner, from pursuing any legal remedy afforded it to recover damages for expenses incurred by it in any way associated with the default of a permittee with respect to the permittees obligations and commitments associated with a Permit.
8. Any cost of collecting a bond, including without limitation, attorney, bank and other collection fees and expenditures, shall be for account of the applicant and may be deducted from the Bond..
10.3.E Bond Reduction.
At the request of the developer, the Town may reduce the required Bond commensurate with the bondable items completed and found acceptable to the Town Engineer. Said bond may be reduced to not less than 15 percent of the original Bond until all improvements are completed and a Certificate of Zoning Compliance is granted.
10.3.F Bond Release.
Any required bond shall not be released by the Commission, or agent until:
1. The release has been requested, in writing, by the applicant,
2. The Town Engineer has submitted a letter stating that all required improvements have been satisfactorily completed and that all conditions and requirements of the Commission's approval have been satisfied, and
3. The applicant's engineer or surveyor has certified to the Commission, or agent, through submission of a set of detailed "Record" plans or sufficient documentation, that all improvements and other work are in accordance with submitted site plans
