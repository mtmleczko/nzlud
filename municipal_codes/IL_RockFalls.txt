PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Rock Falls, Illinois. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1990 Code, as supplemented through January 14, 2014, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1990 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Kim Ryder, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Mr. Eric Arduini, City Clerk, and the city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 6-153. - Site design standards. 
    The following design standards shall be applied in the preparation of plans as specified in section 6-152(b), and shall be used by the building department and building committee to evaluate such plans: 
(1)  Site preparation requirements. 
a.  Engineering. 
1.  Grading. Modifications to preexisting landforms, terrain, and vegetation shall be minimized. Site grading shall reflect the natural contours of the land and the contours of adjacent properties. Abrupt or unnatural appearing grading design shall not be permitted. Created slopes shall be no steeper than three vertical feet for every one horizontal foot (3:1). 
2.  Drainage. Development shall be planned and constructed that all surface drainage meets the standards of applicable city, county, and state erosion control and stormwater management regulations, and does not adversely affect neighboring properties. Stormwater management facilities, such as basins and conveyance routes, shall be located, designed, and landscaped to be an integral and attractive part of the site, with an emphasis on curvilinear shapes and natural edge vegetation. 
3.  Retaining walls. Where a retaining wall is necessary, it shall be designed to not exceed eight feet in total height, shall be set back from lot lines, and shall be constructed with stone or masonry. Terracing shall be considered as an alternative to the use of tall or prominent retaining walls, particularly in highly visible areas on hillsides. Terraces within staggered retaining walls shall be at least four feet in depth and landscaped. 
b.  Tree preservation. 
1.  The site plan shall be designed to preserve a majority of existing high-quality, mature, healthy, non-plantation trees and woodlands. Mature trees are defined as trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) of over 12 inches, and woodlands are defined as nonplantation, continuous wooded areas where at least 50-percent of the trees meet this DBH standard. Such trees and woodlands shall be included in the site plan submittal under section 6-152(b)(2) of this guide. The building code committee may allow for credit against the landscaping requirements in section 6-153(2)c for preserved mature trees and woodlands. 
2.  Trees identified for preservation on the approved site plan shall be protected during construction with barrier fencing installed near the drip line. If a tree or woodland designated for preservation is removed or substantially damaged during site clearing, grading, or construction, the property owner shall replace the removed or damaged tree on a diameter inches for diameter inches bases.

Sec. 6-252. - Residential structures and land uses.

The landlord may not increase for disabled persons any customarily required security deposit. However, where it is necessary in order to ensure with reasonable certainty that funds will be available to pay for the restorations at the end of the tenancy, the landlord may negotiate as part of such a restoration agreement a provision requiring that the tenant pay into an interest bearing escrow account, over a reasonable period, a reasonable amount of money not to exceed the cost of the restorations. The interest in any such account shall accrue to the benefit of the tenant. 
(2)  A landlord may condition permission for a modification on the renter providing a reasonable description of the proposed modifications as well as reasonable assurances that the work will be done in a workmanlike manner, that any required building permits will be obtained and that all labor and material used in making the modifications will be paid for in a timely manner so that no right to a mechanic's lien will arise from such modifications.

DIVISION 2. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 

Sec. 6-691. - Intent and purpose. 
    The purpose of this division is to diminish threats to public health, safety and welfare caused by runoff of excessive stormwater from new development and redevelopment. This excessive stormwater could result in the inundation of damageable properties, the erosion and destabilization of downstream channels, and the pollution of valuable stream and river resources. The cause of increases in stormwater runoff quantity and rate and impairment of quality is the development and improvement of land and as such this division regulates these activities to prevent adverse impacts. This division is adopted to accomplish the following objectives: 
(1)  To ensure that new development does not increase the drainage or flood hazards to others, or create unstable conditions susceptible to erosion; 
(2)  To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from flood damage due to increased stormwater runoff; 
(3)  To protect human life and health from the hazards of increased flooding on a watershed basis; 
(4)  To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects, repairs to flood-damaged public facilities and utilities, correction of channel erosion problems, and flood rescue and relief operations caused by increased stormwater runoff quantities from new development; 
(5)  To protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land and water resources; 
(6)  To preserve the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of watercourses and floodplains and to protect water quality and aquatic habitats; 
(7)  To preserve the natural characteristics of stream corridors in order to moderate flood and stormwater impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic development.

(Code 1990, § 5-616; Ord. No. 2000-1941, 6-20-2000) 
Sec. 6-698. - Design criteria, standards, and methods. 
(a)  Release rates. The drainage system for a property shall be designed to control the peak rate of discharge from the property for a two-year and 100-year event of durations producing the maximum peak stormwater discharge to levels which will not cause an increase in flooding or channel instability downstream when considered in aggregate with other developed properties and downstream drainage capacities. The peak discharge from events less than or equal to the two-year event shall not be greater than 0.25 cfs per acre of property drained. The peak 100-year discharge shall not be greater than 0.80 cfs of property drained. In the event the downstream drainage systems are inadequate to receive the release rate herein above provided, then the allowable release rate shall be reduced to that rate permitted by the receiving downstream sewers, streams, and channels; this means that additional detention may be required to store that portion of the runoff exceeding the capacity of the receiving sewers, streams, and channels. 
(b)  Detention basin outlet design. Backwater on the outlet structure from the downstream drainage system shall be evaluated when designing the outlet. 
(c)  Benchmark. A permanent reference elevation benchmark shall be established in the vicinity of the stormwater drainage facility. 
(Code 1990, § 5-617; Ord. No. 2000-1941, 6-20-2000) 
Sec. 6-699. - Detention storage requirements. 
    The design maximum storage to be provided in a detention basin shall be based on the runoff from the 100-year event of the duration producing the maximum peak stormwater discharge and reservoir (also called modified Puls or level pool) routing or equal. Detention storage shall be computed using hydrograph methods as described in this division. 
(Code 1990, § 5-618; Ord. No. 2000-1941, 6-20-2000) 
Sec. 6-700. - Drainage system design and evaluation. 
    The criteria specified in sections 6-701 through 6-709 shall be used in evaluating and designing the drainage system. The underlying objective is to provide capacity to pass the ten-year peak flow in the minor drainage system and an overland flow path for flows in excess of the design capacity. 
(Code 1990, § 5-619; Ord. No. 2000-1941, 6-20-2000) 
Sec. 6-701. - Design methodologies. 
(a)  Rational formula. Major and minor conveyance systems for areas up to ten acres may be designed using the rational formula. The rational formula may also be used in sizing the minor drainage system for larger sites. Runoff hydrograph methods as described in section 6-702 must be used for major drainage system design for all systems with greater than ten acres of drainage area and for the design of all detention basins, where required by the director of the wastewater department. 
(b)  Positive drainage. Whenever practicable, all areas of the property must be provided an overland flow path that will pass the 100-year flow at a stage at least one foot below the lowest foundation grade in the vicinity of the flow path. Overland flow paths designed to handle flows in excess of the minor drainage system capacity shall be provided drainage easements. Street ponding and flow depths shall not exceed curb heights by more than one inch. 
(Code 1990, § 5-620; Ord. No. 2000-1941, 6-20-2000) 
Sec. 6-702. - Methods for generating runoff hydrograph. 
    A runoff hydrograph shall be developed incorporating the following assumptions of rainfall amounts and antecedent moisture. 
(1)  Rainfall. All design rainfall events shall be based on the state water survey's Bulletin 70. The first quartile point rainfall distribution shall be used for the design and analysis of conveyance systems with critical durations less than or equal to 12 hours. The third quartile point rainfall distribution shall be used for the design and analysis of detention basins and conveyance system with critical durations greater than 12 and less than or equal to 24 hours. The fourth quartile distribution shall be used in the design and analysis of systems with durations greater than 24 hours. The first, third, and fourth quartile distributions described by Huff are presented in table 37 of Bulletin 70. The SCS Type II distribution may be used as an alternate to the Huff distributions. 
(2)  Antecedent moisture. Computations of runoff hydrographs shall assume antecedent moisture condition 11 as defined by the soil conservation service (SCS) Technical Release 55. 
(Code 1990, § 5-621; Ord. No. 2000-1941, 6-20-2000)

    Wet detention basins shall be designed to be safe, aesthetically pleasing, and as much as feasible to be available for recreational use. 
(1)  Wet basin depths. Wet basins shall be at least five feet deep, excluding near shore banks and safety ledges. If fish habitat is to be provided they shall be at least ten feet deep over 25 percent of the bottom area to prevent winter freeze-out. 
(2)  Wet basin shoreline slopes. The side slopes of wet basins at the normal pool elevation shall not be steeper than four to one (horizontal to vertical). 
(3)  Erosion control. The area between low water and high water levels in wet basins shall be rip-rapped with stone, concrete, sod or other suitable material. 
(4)  Permanent pool volume. The permanent pool volume in a wet basin at normal depth shall be equal to the runoff volume from its watershed for the two-year event. 
(5)  Inlet and outlet orientation. To the extent feasible, the distance between detention inlets and outlets shall be maximized. If possible, they should be at opposite ends of the basin. 
(Code 1990, § 5-622; Ord. No. 2000-1941, 6-20-2000) 
Sec. 6-704. - Dry detention basin design. 
    In addition to the other requirements of this division, dry basins shall be designed to be safe and aesthetically pleasing and, as much as feasible, to be available for multiple uses. 
(1)  Dry basin drainage. Dry basins shall be designed so that 80 percent of their bottom area shall have standing water no longer than 72 hours for any runoff event less than the 100-year event. Under drains directed to the outlet control shall be used, if necessary, to accomplish this requirement. 
(2)  Velocity dissipation. Velocity dissipation measures shall be incorporated into dry basin designs to minimize erosion at inlets and outlets and to minimize the resuspension of pollutants. 
(3)  Inlet and outlet orientation. To the extent feasible, the distance between detention inlets and outlets shall be maximized. If possible, they should be at opposite ends of the basin. 
(4)  Low flow discharge. Dry bottom basins shall provide for a low-flow, bypass system to accommodate low intensity storms. The low-flow, bypass system or systems shall be constructed of suitable pipe with an inside diameter equal, in aggregate, to the carrying capacity of the outlet pipe but not less than six inches. Cleanouts, manholes, or catchbasins shall be appropriately placed in the low-flow bypass system and all changes in direction or slope to facilitate cleaning. Under drains installed under the bottom of a detention area shall be perforated and covered on all sides with a minimum of six inches of porous granular material, CA18 in accordance with the state standard specification for road and bridge construction. Whenever detention or retention basins are also intended for public acceptance, under drainage systems shall be installed. 
(5)  Minimum detention outlet size. Where a single pipe outlet or orifice plate is to be used to control discharge, it shall have a minimum diameter of four inches. If this minimum orifice size permits release rates greater than those specified in this section, and regional detention is not a practical alternative, alternative outlet designs shall be utilized which incorporate self-cleaning flow restrictions. 
(Code 1990, § 5-623; Ord. No. 2000-1941, 6-20-2000) 
Sec. 6-705. - Detention in floodplain.

However, the stormwater detention requirements of this division may be fulfilled by providing detention storage within flood fringe areas on the project site provided the following provisions are met. 
(1)  Detention in flood fringe areas. The placement of a detention basin in a flood fringe area shall require compensatory storage for 1.2 times the volume below the base flood elevation occupied by the detention basin including any berms. The release from the detention storage provided shall still be controlled consistent with the requirements of this section. The applicant shall demonstrate its operation for all streamflow and floodplain backwater conditions. Excavations for compensatory storage along watercourses shall be opposite or adjacent to the area occupied by detention. 
(2)  Detention in floodways. Detention basins shall be placed in the floodway only in accordance with subsection (3) of this section. 
(3)  On-stream detention. On-stream detention basins are discouraged but allowable if they provide regional public benefits and if they meet the other provisions of this article with respect to water quality and control of the two-year and 100-year, 24-hour events from the property. Further criteria are presented in section 6-707. If on-stream detention is used for watersheds larger than one square mile, the applicant shall perform hydrologic modeling and demonstrate that the design will not increase high water elevation for any properties upstream or downstream of the property. Also, impoundment of the stream as part of on-stream detention: 
a.  Shall not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for spawning; 
b.  Shall not cause or contribute to the degradation of water quality or stream aquatic habitat; 
c.  Shall not involve any stream channelization or the filling of wetlands; 
d.  Shall not occur downstream of a wastewater discharge; and

Secs. 6-717-6-745. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 3. - CONTROL OF SOIL EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION FROM AREAS UNDERGOING DEVELOPMENT 

Sec. 6-746. - Intent and purpose. 
    The purpose of this division is to safeguard persons, protect property, prevent damage to the environment, and promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating and controlling the design, construction, use and maintenance of any development or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or otherwise results in the movement of earth on land situation in the city. This division is adopted with the following understandings: 
(1)  Excessive quantities of soil may erode from areas undergoing development for certain non-agricultural uses including, but not limited to, the construction of dwelling units, commercial buildings and industrial plants, the building of roads and highways, and the creation of recreational facilities; 
(2)  The washing, blowing, and falling of eroded soil across and upon roadways endangers the health and safety of users thereof by decreasing vision and reducing traction of road vehicles; 
(3)  Soil erosion necessitates the costly repairing of gullies, washed-out fills, and embankments; 
(4)  Sediment from soil erosion tends to clog sewers and ditches and to pollute and silt rivers, streams, lakes, and reservoirs; 
(5)  Sediment limits the use of water and waterways for most beneficial purposes, promotes the growth of undesirable aquatic weeds, destroys fish and other desirable aquatic life, and is costly and difficult to remove; and 
(6)  Sediment reduces the channel capacity of waterways, resulting in increased chances of flooding at risk to public health and safety. 
(Code 1990, § 5-650; Ord. No. 2000-1941, 6-20-2000) 
Sec. 6-747. - General principles. 
    It is the objective of this division to control soil erosion and sedimentation caused by development activities in the city. Measures taken to control erosion and sedimentation should be adequate to ensure that sediment is not transported from the site by a storm event of ten-year frequency or less. The following principles shall apply to all development activities within the city and to the preparation of the submissions required: 
(1)  Development should be related to the topography and soils of the site so as to create the least potential for erosion. Areas of steep slopes where high cuts and fills may be required should be avoided wherever possible, and natural contours should be followed as closely as possible. 
(2)  Natural vegetation should be retained and protected wherever possible. Areas immediately adjacent to natural watercourses should be left undisturbed wherever possible. 
(3)  The smallest practical areas of land should be exposed for the shortest practical time during development. 
(4)  Sediment basins, debris basins, desilting basins, or silt traps or filters should be installed and maintained to remove sediment from runoff waters from land undergoing development. 
(5)  The selection of erosion and sedimentation control measures should be based on assessment of the probable frequency of climatic and other events likely to contribute to erosion, and on evaluation of the risks, costs, and benefits involved. 
(6)  In the design of erosion control facilities and practices, aesthetics and the requirements of continuing maintenance should be considered. 
(7)  Provision should be made to accommodate the increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions during and after development. Drainageways should be designed so that their final gradients and the resultant velocities of discharges will not create additional erosion. 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structures should be installed as soon as practical during development. 
(Code 1990, § 5-651; Ord. No. 2000-1941, 6-20-2000)

Sec. 12-22. - Statement of policy. 
(a)  When certain individuals are treated differently in the housing market because of racial, religious or other prejudices, the entire community suffers. Discrimination frequently denies its immediate victims their right to acquire a decent home in a safe and pleasant neighborhood. Discrimination also typically causes neighborhoods to become highly segregated, and engenders instability on the fringes of such areas. This instability seriously impairs any sense of community responsibility and accelerates neighborhood decay. Neighborhood decay reduces the housing supply and deflates the tax base. Concurrently, it increases the need for government services and necessitates a higher tax rate. 
(b)  Although discrimination in housing is proscribed by the United States and Illinois Constitutions and by various federal laws, the problem is best handled at the local level because there is no state-wide enforcement program, and the federal enforcement machinery is disturbingly slow, inadequate, and sometimes simply unresponsive to local needs. 
(c)  In light of the above, the council hereby declares that it is the public policy of the city to endeavor to ensure all persons an equal opportunity to provide for themselves a home of their own choosing that is as sufficient as their individual talents, industry and circumstances may permit.

ARTICLE IV. - HOUSE NUMBERING 

Sec. 26-152. - Thoroughfare naming and property numbering system. 
(a)  Thoroughfare names. Thoroughfare names shall be chosen that relate to the scale and location of the subdivision or local history. 
(1)  Objectives. Names should be pleasant sounding, appropriate, easy to read (so the public, children in particular, can handle the name in an emergency situation), and should add to the pride of home ownership and entrepreneurial activity. 
(2)  Categories. Wherever possible, street names in the same section of a neighborhood or subdivision in the city shall be related to identifiable local landmarks, historic events, or themes. 
(3)  Unacceptable thoroughfare names. Numerical names, e.g., First or 1st, which do not correspond with address numbers in hundred blocks; alphabetical letters, e.g., A, B, C, etc.; frivolous, complicated or undesirable names; unconventional spelling; compound names (unless used sparingly and not on short streets); words in a foreign language; proper names, e.g., Carol, Ellen, George, etc., shall not be permitted. 
(4)  Affixes. Unnecessary affixes are to be avoided. The only terms which may be used as prefixes are: East, West, North and South which shall indicate direction from the base lines. The only terms which may be used as suffixes are: 
a.  "Alley" or "Lane" to describe a secondary access drive to property, generally in the rear of the property. 
b.  "Boulevard" to describe a thoroughfare divided by a landscaped center island, or a major thoroughfare running in a diagonal direction, rather than east-west or north-south, which connects at least two arterial or collector thoroughfares. 
c.  "Close" to describe an open space having property frontage, but no public right-of-way, along its perimeter and having one side fronting a public thoroughfare. 
d.  "Court" to describe a permanently closed thoroughfare ending in a turnaround such as a cul-de-sac. 
e.  "Drive" "Trail" or "Way" to describe a winding or curvilinear thoroughfare that meanders about and continues through to other rights-of-way, generally discontinuous thoroughfares. 
f.  "Highway" to describe a designated state or federal highway. 
g.  "Circle" to describe short thoroughfares that return to themselves or begin and circle back to terminate on the same thoroughfare. 
h.  "Parkway" to describe a special scenic route or park drive or thoroughfare having an unusual amount of landscaping. 
i.  "Place" to describe any private street, usually a private cul-de-sac or permanent dead-end thoroughfare. 
j.  "Road" to describe any thoroughfare located on a section line, having heavy traffic volume, and running in any direction. 
k.  "Square" to describe any thoroughfare that forms one or more sides of an attached or detached square. 
l.  "Street" or "Avenue" to describe thoroughfares generally parallel to the base lines and having continuity; streets run east-west; avenues run north-south. 
(5)  Name duplication. Similar sounding names are considered to be duplication, regardless of spelling. No duplication of names is permitted in the city, and no duplication of names is permitted within the service area of a fire protection district regardless whether the duplicate name is located in or outside the city corporate limits. 
(6)  Continuity. A continuous thoroughfare, or a thoroughfare proposed to be a continuous thoroughfare, shall bear the same name throughout, even if it changes direction or if interim gaps prevent the thoroughfare from being continuous. No separate name is to be used for a cul-de-sac that provides street frontage for three or less lots or dwelling units. The name shall be the same as that of the intersecting thoroughfare. However, where there is a series of long and short culs-de-sac along a thoroughfare, each shall have a separate name. 
(b)  Property numbering. 
(1)  Vanity addresses. Vanity addresses are prohibited. The term "vanity address" means one in which the name or number have no relationship to the city's street naming and property numbering system. 
(2)  Reference point. The reference point, or point of origin, for the city property numbering system shall be the intersection of 1st Avenue and 1st Street. 
(3)  Base lines. The base lines from which measurements used to assign property numbers are taken for the city property numbering system shall be 1st Avenue and 1st Street. 
(4)  Grid lines. The grid lines indicating where block numbers change from 100 to the next higher hundred for the city property numbering system shall be at an interval of 2,000 feet on the east-west axis, and at an interval of 2,000 feet on the north-south axis. 
(5)  Frontage unit. The standard interval in frontage to assign consecutive property numbers on any thoroughfare in the city shall be ten feet. 
(6)  Countywide numbering system. A property numbering system shall be developed and maintained for each new development in the city without necessary regard for the existing countywide numbering system. 
(c)  Assigning numbers to individual parcels. 
(1)  General. When assigning numbers, start at the grid or base line and allow hypothetical numbers for each frontage interval. Do not skip across streets, utility easements, railroads, streams, etc., because if time brings change, there will be numbers available to assign to new parcels. Vacant property is not to be assigned a number until something is built thereon it. The interval closest to a line perpendicular to the front building entrance shall be the one assigned. 
(2)  West of 1st Avenue. Odd numbers shall be assigned to buildings on the southerly and easterly sides of the thoroughfare west of 1st Avenue. Even numbers shall be assigned to the opposite side. 
(3)  East of 1st Avenue. Odd numbers shall be assigned to buildings on the northerly and easterly sides of the thoroughfare east of 1st Avenue. Even numbers shall be assigned to the opposite side. 
(4)  Apartments and condominiums. Separate units of condominium and apartment buildings having internal entrances shall be designated with sub-numbers and letters (e.g., Apt. A, Apt. 310), but not individual property numbers. 
(5)  Business districts. In a commercial, office, or industrial district, each external door shall have its own number. Businesses with an internal entrance shall be designated by suite numbers or letters (e.g., Suite 206). 
(6)  Numbering when a thoroughfare changes direction. As a general rule, if a thoroughfare changes direction drastically and for a substantial length, the numbering should be changed to reflect the orientation with a different base line. The same criteria used to determine when to change a thoroughfare name shall be used to decide whether to use numbering from the east-west axis or the north-south axis. 
(7)  Thoroughfares starting from different points on the same cross street. When a thoroughfare does not begin at the same location as a parallel thoroughfare, the numbers shall begin with the same number measured from the base line as on the parallel thoroughfare. Likewise, buildings facing thoroughfares that do not extend to the base line at present are assigned numbers as if they were extended to the base line. 
(8)  Diagonal thoroughfares. The general principle to apply when numbering diagonal thoroughfares is to treat the thoroughfare as either a north-south or an east-west thoroughfare if it is not a perfect diagonal. If the thoroughfare is a perfect diagonal, an arbitrary decision is made to treat it is a north-south or an east-west thoroughfare. 
(9)  Corner lots. When assigning a number to a building on a corner lot, assign a number from the thoroughfare upon which the front entrance faces. Dual addresses shall be avoided if at all possible. 
(10)  Group housing projects/private drives. Because of private drives and interior parking bays, group housing developments present unique problems to the assignment of property numbers. A number shall be assigned to the property where the driveway joins the thoroughfare and shall become the street address of all units which face upon that interior court or parking lot. The separate apartments or stores shall have a sub-number, for example, 630 Dixon Avenue Building D. This method shall also be utilized for assigning numbers in crowded, disorganized, or haphazard development where there are rear dwellings. 
(11)  Duplex buildings, multiple buildings on a lot, and buildings with multiple entrances. 
a.  Separate numbers shall be assigned to each entrance of a duplex house, for an upstairs apartment which has an outside entrance, for separate buildings in the rear of other buildings, and for separate entrances in an apartment or commercial building. If a commercial enterprise that is part of a residence has a separate entrance from a thoroughfare, it shall also be assigned a separate number. 
b.  If there is a rear entrance or a hidden structure, a post shall display the number on the path leading to the entrance, even if it is reached through another structure. For units on alleys or interior malls where there is no access to a thoroughfare parallel to the alley, a name shall be given to the alley and property numbers are assigned accordingly. If there is access from a parallel thoroughfare, numbers shall be assigned from the series on that thoroughfare. 
c.  In the case of commercial or industrial facilities, auxiliary buildings will not be assigned separate numbers, but the main building (where business is transacted) will receive a property number. 
(12)  Numbering on circle and loop thoroughfares. Circle thoroughfares begin and end touching the same thoroughfare. It is advisable in such cases to ignore compass directions and to give numbers on such thoroughfares to correspond with the numbering on the street where the circle is originated. There will be more properties on the outside of the circle than on the inside of the circle. In such cases, numbers shall be assigned in the regular manner to the side of the circle thoroughfare having the greatest property frontage along the thoroughfare, using consecutive odd or even numbers. Numbers shall then be assigned to the side having the shorter frontage such that numbers correspond with property on the opposite side of the thoroughfare. It is wise to avoid duplication of numbers if an auxiliary thoroughfare using a different thoroughfare designation carries the same name as the main thoroughfare.

It shall be unlawful for any person to fail to so number any commercial or residential building owned or occupied by him after receipt of notice to so number from the proper authority of the city.

ARTICLE VII. - CONSTRUCTION OF UTILITY FACILITIES IN THE RIGHTS-OF-WAY 

Sec. 26-229. - Purpose and scope. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish policies and procedures for constructing facilities on rights-of-way within the city's jurisdiction, which will provide public benefit consistent with the preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the city rights-of-way and the city as a whole. 
(b)  Intent. In enacting this article, the city intends to exercise its authority over the rights-of-way in the city and, in particular, the use of the public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to address issues presented by utility facilities, including without limitation: 
(1)  Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys, parkways and other public ways and places; 
(2)  Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic; 
(3)  Prevent interference with the facilities and operations of the city's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or public property; 
(4)  Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees, from the installation of utility facilities; 
(5)  Protect against increased stormwater run-off due to structures and materials that increase impermeable surfaces; 
(6)  Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are installed; 
(7)  Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that characterize the city's residential neighborhoods; 
(8)  Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the rights-of-way; and 
(9)  Ensure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties adjacent to utility facilities locations. 
(c)  Facilities subject to this article. This article applies to all facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way within the jurisdiction of the city. A facility lawfully established prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived may continue to be maintained, repaired and operated by the utility as presently constructed and located, except as may be otherwise provided in any applicable franchise, license or similar agreement. 
(d)  Franchises, licenses, or similar agreements. The city, in its discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities to enter into a franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the city rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an agreement may request that the city enter into such an agreement. In such an agreement, the city may provide for terms and conditions inconsistent with this article. 
(e)  Effect of franchises, licenses, or similar agreements. 
(1)  Utilities other than telecommunications providers. In the event that a utility other than a telecommunications provider has a franchise, license or similar agreement with the city, such franchise, license or similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any lawful renewal or extension thereof. 
(2)  Telecommunications providers. In the event of any conflict with, or inconsistency between, the provisions of this article and the provisions of any franchise, license or similar agreement between the city and any telecommunications provider, the provisions of such franchise, license or similar agreement shall govern and control during the term of such agreement and any lawful renewal or extension thereof. 
(f)  Conflicts with other chapters . This article supersedes all ordinances or parts of ordinances thereof adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith, to the extent of such conflict. 
(g)  Conflicts with state and federal laws. In the event that applicable federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this article, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this article to the maximum extent possible without violating federal or state laws or regulations. 
(h)  Sound engineering judgment . The city shall use sound engineering judgment when administering this article and may vary the standards, conditions, and requirements expressed in this article when the city so determines.

The security fund shall serve as security for: 
(1)  The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this article; 
(2)  Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the city occasioned by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the city issued pursuant to this article; and 
(3)  The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses that the city may pay or incur by reason of any action or non-performance by permittee in violation of this article including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is required by this article to perform that the city must perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due the city from the permittee pursuant to this article or any other applicable law. 
(b)  Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the city in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to the city, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the city. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection (b) shall, at a minimum: 
(1)  Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the city and the permittee; 
(2)  Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the city of any amounts covered by it; and 
(3)  Shall provide a location convenient to the city and within the state at which it can be drawn. 
(c)  Amount. The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the permit, as determined by the building official, and may also include reasonable, directly related costs that the city estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the city, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the building official may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection (c) for any single phase. 
(d)  Withdrawals. The city, upon 14 days' advance written notice clearly stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this subsection (d), may withdraw an amount from the security fund; provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the city for such amount within the 14-day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee: 
(1)  Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee hereunder; 
(2)  Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid; 
(3)  Fails to reimburse the city for any damages, claims, costs or expenses which the city has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any action or non-performance by the permittee; or 
(4)  Fails to comply with any provision of this article that the city determines can be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the security fund. 
(e)  Replenishment. Within 14 days after receipt of written notice from the city that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in subsection (c) of this section. 
(f)  Interest. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the security fund be returned to the permittee by the city, upon written request for said withdrawal to the city; provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund below the minimum balance required in subsection (c) of this section. 
(g)  Closing and return of security fund. Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of the security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the city for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this article or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the city to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the city as a result of said revocation; provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be refunded to the permittee.

Parking on the shoulder in such an emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility is available. 
(2)  In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the building official or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs.

(1)  One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and 
(2)  All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are impracticable in relation to the requested approach. 
(d)  Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for authorizing a variance, the building official may require the utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be expressly contained within this article but which carry out the purposes of this article. 
(e)  Right to appeal. Any utility aggrieved by any order, requirement, decision or determination, including denial of a variance, made by the building official under the provisions of this article shall have the right to appeal to the city council, or such other board or commission as it may designate.

Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the city's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit related cost apportionment of the city. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility that does not pay the costs apportioned to it.

(4)  The procedure to obtain reinstatement of utility services. 
(c)  Any time before the date specified within any notice to a customer as the date of termination of utility services for non-payment of a bill, or for violation of any provision of this Code, or within ten days following the giving of a notice of rejection for utility services, the customer may dispute the basis for the proposed termination of services or the basis for the rejection; provided, however, that the customer shall not be entitled to dispute the basis of termination or rejection for services if the basis was the subject of a previous dispute which was either: 
(1)  Adjudicated pursuant to this section; or 
(2)  Not properly challenged by the customer's failure to follow the procedure set out in this section. 
(d)  The procedure to dispute termination of services or rejection for services shall be as follows: 
(1)  Before the date specified in the notice for termination of services or within ten days following receipt of notice of rejection for services, the customer shall notify the supervisor of the customer service office of the city, in writing, that the customer disputes all or part of the amounts shown on the bill, or disputes the basis for rejection of services, or that the customer claims other reasons for disputing the right of the city to terminate services or the right of the city to reject the customer for services. Such writing shall state as completely as possible the basis and nature of the dispute. 
(2)  If the supervisor of the customer service office determines that the dispute is untimely, or that the customer previously disputed the termination or the rejection upon the same basis, the supervisor shall mail to the customer a notice stating that the present dispute is untimely or invalid for prior adjudication. A dispute is untimely if filed after service has been terminated. 
(3)  If the supervisor of the customer service office determines that the dispute is not untimely or invalid under this section, the supervisor shall, within three days after receipt of the customer's notice, arrange an informal meeting between the customer and the superintendent of each affected utility department.

The superintendent of each affected utility department shall, within five days after the meeting with the customer, mail to the customer a copy of the superintendent's decision resolving the dispute.

Upon filing of the request by the customer, a formal hearing shall be held by the utilities committee within ten days following receipt of the customer's request for such hearing. 
(6)  At the hearing before the utilities committee, the superintendent of the affected utility department and the customer shall be entitled to present all evidence that, in the view of the utilities committee, is relevant and material to the dispute, and the committee shall be entitled to examine and cross examine witnesses. A record of the hearing shall be maintained. 
(7)  At the conclusion of the hearing, the utilities committee shall render a decision on the dispute. Such decision shall be reduced to writing and a copy thereof shall be mailed to the customer within five days of the hearing. The decision shall be final and binding on the affected utility department, and on the customer. 
(e)  Utilization of the dispute procedure provided for in this section shall not relieve a customer of the obligation to timely and completely pay all other undisputed utility charges for services supplied by the city or to timely and completely pay undisputed portions of amounts which are subject to the instant dispute, or to otherwise comply with the requirements of this Code. Failure by the customer to timely and completely pay all such undisputed amounts or to otherwise comply with requirements of this Code shall be cause for termination of the utility service in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(f)  Until the date of the decision of the affected utility department superintendent becomes final, or until the date of the decision of the utilities committee (if the customer shall have appealed the superintendent's decision) the utility service which has been the subject of the dispute shall not be terminated based solely upon the matters in dispute; provided, however, that nothing shall prohibit termination of the utility service for other cause which is undisputed by the customer. If the decision of the superintendent or the utilities committee, as applicable, is unfavorable to the customer disputing the charge, the notice to the customer of such unfavorable decision shall specify a date not less than five days after such notice within which all disputed amounts must be paid or within which other such corrective action must be taken by the customer in order to avoid termination of the utility services. Failure by the customer to pay or take such other action within the time specified in such notice shall then be cause for termination of the utility services at the expiration of the time period. 
(g)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f) of this section, the provisions of this subsection shall govern all termination of utility service for non-payment of utility charges or for failure to comply with other requirements of this Code. 
(1)  If, by the payment date shown on any bill for utility services, the city shall not have received complete payment of the amounts shown on the bill or if the violations alleged within any notice of violation of provisions of this Code shall have not been corrected by the date specified in such violation notice, the customer service office shall mail to or personally serve upon the customer a notice of termination of utility services. 
(2)  The notice of termination shall contain the following information: 
a.  The amount to be paid or the nature of the violation to be corrected; 
b.  The date of the notice of termination; 
c.  The date after which termination of utility services shall be made, which date shall be at least eight days from the date of the notice of termination; 
d.  Notice that unless the payment of the amounts specified or that the affected utility department superintendent has certified that the violation has been corrected prior to the date of termination, that the utility service shall be terminated under this subsection (g); 
e.  Notice that in lieu of paying the entire amount shown, a customer, prior to the date of termination, may notify the customer service office that he disputes the correctness of all or part of the amount shown or that he disputes that he is in violation of provisions of this Code cited as authority for the termination notice, provided that the basis of the dispute shall not have been the subject of a previous dispute either waived or adjudicated. 
(3)  If, prior to the date specified within the notice after which utility services will be terminated, the city shall not have received complete payment of the amounts shown on the notice of termination and if no notice of dispute under subsection (f) of this section shall have been received by the city, or if the customer shall not have corrected any violation of provisions of this Code as shown on the notice of termination, then the utility services which are the subject of the notice of termination shall be terminated and disconnected. If, however, the customer pays the entire amount shown on the notice of termination, or if the superintendent of the affected utility department certifies that the violations of this Code serving as the basis for the notice of termination have been corrected, then such payment or correction shall be considered timely, and the notice of termination shall be ineffective. 
(h)  (1)  Utility services shall be terminated for non-payment only during the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday; and on Friday during the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. 
(2)  No terminations shall be permitted on a legal holiday or on the day before a legal holiday, and a federal holiday or on the day before a federal holiday. 
(3)  No terminations of utility services shall be permitted on a day when the low temperature forecast for the following 24 hours, as reported by the National Weather Service at its first order station nearest the residence, includes a forecast that the temperature will be below 20 degrees Fahrenheit. If the utility service to a residential customer has been terminated and not reinstated by 5:00 p.m. on the day of termination, when the low temperature within the previous 24 hours, as reported by the National Weather Service at its first order station nearest residence, was below 32 degrees Fahrenheit, the customer service office shall notify the police department of the city on the day of termination of the following: 
a.  The name of the customer; 
b.  The address and location of the residence no longer receiving such utility services; 
c.  The possible threat to the health and life of all persons residing at the residence. 
(i)  In the event of termination of utility services in accordance with the provisions of this section, such utility services shall be reinstated to the customer within one full working day of receipt by the customer service office of complete payment of the amount prompting the termination (including required deposits) and any reconnection charges, or receipt of notice from the superintendent of the affected utility department that the violation of the provision of this Code giving rise to the termination has been corrected. Such payment or correction of violations shall not be considered timely for purposes of this article. 
(j)  In computing any period of time prescribed by this section, the day of the act or event from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included. The last day of the period so completed shall be included, unless it is a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday, in which event the period runs until the next day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. When the period of time prescribed is less than seven days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays shall be excluded in the computation. 
(k)  In addition to being subject to a termination of service pursuant to this section, each bill for utility services which shall not have been paid by the customer on or prior to the due date shown on the monthly bill, shall have added to the bill the amount of five percent of the monthly bill as a late payment penalty, unless the customer listed on the bill is 65 years or older before the time listed as the due date, or if the customer is receiving federal Social Security Disability and can provide proof of coverage to city staff.

The city clerk is authorized and directed to prepare and file with the county recorder of deeds a statement of lien claim for the amount of delinquency and lien in the form as required by statute authorizing the filing of such lien statement. If the user whose bill is unpaid is not the owner of the premises and the city clerk has notice of this fact, notice of the claiming of lien shall also be mailed to the owner of the premises, if the owner's address is known to the city clerk, whenever such bill remains unpaid; provided, however, that the failure of the city clerk to record such lien notice or to mail such notice or the failure of the owner to receive such notice shall not affect the right of the city to foreclose upon the lien for unpaid utility services of water and sewerage charges. Any property subject to a lien for unpaid charges shall be subject to foreclosure of such lien by bill in equity in the name of the city, in accordance with procedures under the statute providing for such liens. Upon authorization by the city council, the city attorney will be authorized and directed to institute such proceedings in the name of the city in any court having jurisdiction over such matters against any property for which the city is entitled to a lien under this provision or any provision of any statute of the state.

DIVISION 4. - RATES 

Sec. 32-304. - Basis, rates and charges for sewerage service. 
(a)  Basis for wastewater service charges. The wastewater service charges for the use of and for service supplied by the wastewater facilities of the city shall consist of the following: 
(1)  A debt service (DS) charge per billing period to pay the annual principal and interest costs of all outstanding sewerage debt issues; 
(2)  A capital improvement (CI) charge per billing period to provide sums required for capital improvements and replacements; 
(3)  A basic usage charge (BC) per billing period; 
(4)  A basic usage rate (R) to be applied to discharges to the wastewater system and, when so applied, to cover, with the basic usage charge, the fixed and variable expenses and costs of operation, maintenance and repairs of plant and facilities; 
(5)  A replacement treatment plant (RC) charge, per billing period, to create a reserve and to defray and pay costs incurred in the planning, design, development, construction and incurred debt for a replacement wastewater treatment plant; 
(6)  A replacement wastewater treatment plant usage rate (P) to establish a reserve for and to cover the fixed and variable expenses and costs incurred or to be incurred in the operation, maintenance and repairs to the replacement wastewater treatment plant; and 
(7)  A surcharge (S), if applicable, for users whose discharges exceed strength or concentrations of substances as defined hereinafter. 
(b)  Computation and application of charges. 
(1)  The debt service charge (DS) to be applied to each user of the wastewater treatment facilities of the city shall be computed by determining the amount necessary to pay and discharge all debt service (principal and interest), together with such additional amounts as are required by the terms and provisions of any debt instrument heretofore issued by the city and payable from revenues of the wastewater treatment (sewerage) department. The amount so determined shall be divided by 12 to determine the periodic monthly charge. 
(2)  The capital improvement charge (CI) shall apply to all users of the wastewater treatment facilities of the city, shall be for the purpose of creating a financial reserve from which can be paid the cost of replacement of capital items of the system, and shall be calculated by estimating the amount needed annually for capital improvements or replacements within the wastewater treatment system, divided by the estimated number of users. The amount so determined shall be divided by 12 to determine the periodic monthly amount. 
(3)  The basic usage charge (BC) shall apply to all users of the wastewater treatment system and shall allow the user to discharge up to 300 cubic feet of water or wastewater per month. 
(4)  The basic usage rate (R) shall be applied to each 100 cubic feet or portion thereof of water usage or discharge per billing period and shall be based on water usage and/or discharge into the wastewater facilities of the city as recorded by water meters and/or sewerage meters, and shall be determined by computing the amount necessary to pay and cover all fixed and variable costs associated with operation, non-capital maintenance and repair of the wastewater collection and treatment system of the city. The basic usage rate will be applicable to average or below average strength sewage, which is defined as follows: 
a.  Average strength sewage shall be determined to have the following characteristics: 
1.  A five-day, 20-degree Celsius biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) of 200 milligrams per liter; and 
2.  A suspended solids (SS) content of 240 milligrams per liter. 
b.  The basic usage rate shall be fixed to ensure adequate receipts to cover and defray administrative, operation and maintenance costs, including routine replacement items, and shall be computed by estimating projected annual revenues required to operate and maintain the wastewater collection and treatment facilities, estimating the billable wastewater volume to be treated, and computing the cost per 100 cubic feet of billable volume. 
c.  The basic usage rate shall be applied to all water usage and/or discharge in excess of 300 cubic feet, per billing period. 
(5)  The replacement treatment plant charge (RC) shall apply to all users, and shall be for the purpose of creating a financial reserve and for payment of a portion or all of the costs incurred by the city in planning, design, development, permitting and construction of a replacement for the wastewater treatment plant currently operated by the city, and shall be calculated by estimating the amount needed to create such reserve fund and to pay the costs, including land acquisition and engineering, legal and administrative fees and expenses, for the specific purpose of replacement of the wastewater treatment plant. The replacement treatment plant charge shall allow the discharge of up to 300 cubic feet of waste per billing period. 
(6)  The replacement wastewater treatment plant usage rate (P) shall be applied to each 100 cubic feet or portion thereof of water usage or discharge in excess of 300 cubic feet per billing period, and based on water usage and/or wastewater discharge as recorded by water meters and/or sewerage meters, and shall be calculated in the same manner and with the same assumptions of strength of discharge as applicable to the basic usage rate, and shall be for the purpose of establishing a reserve for and to pay and defray any costs associated with or arising from, or increased by, the replacement wastewater treatment plant to be constructed by the city for the fixed and variable expenses and costs of operation, maintenance and repairs of said replacement wastewater treatment plant. 
(7)  A surcharge (S), to be levied in addition to the other portions of the rates and charges as set forth in subsections (b)(1) through (6) of this section will be levied upon all users of the wastewater treatment facilities and plant of the city whose discharges exceed the average strength sewage BOD5 of 200 milligrams per liter or whose discharges exceed the average strength sewage concentrations for suspended solids (SS) of 240 milligrams per liter. The surcharge shall be based on metered sewage flow for all wastes which exceed these concentrations and shall be applied to each 100 cubic feet or portion thereof of discharge. The procedure for computation of a surcharge shall be in accordance with this subsection (b)(7). The unit rates for BOD5 and SS surcharge calculation shall be determined as follows: 
a.  The estimated annual revenue required for operating and maintaining the wastewater treatment facilities, and for the replacement wastewater treatment plant charge shall be proportioned; 
b.  The costs for major plant categories relative to BOD5 and SS shall be proportioned; 
c.  The total wastewater volume, pounds of BOD5 and pounds of SS shall be estimated; and 
d.  The unit cost per pound of BOD5 and SS shall be computed. 
Each user of the wastewater treatment facilities, by taking service and discharging waste into the wastewater treatment system of the city, shall be deemed to have consented for the city, from time to time, and as frequently as determined necessary in the discretion of the superintendent of wastewater treatment department, to go upon the property of the user and take such samples as are deemed appropriate and necessary in order to determine the levels of BOD5 and SS as are existent in the waste discharge by the user into the wastewater treatment facilities, for purposes of determining the applicability of the surcharge. 
(c)  Wastewater service rates and charges. 
(1)  The rates and charges in this subsection are hereby established as the monthly rates and charges for the use of and for service supplied by the wastewater system of the city. In the table which follows, the amount set forth in each column b though g shall be the amount for each component of the rate, and shall be computed in accordance with the formula specified in subsection (d) of this section, and column a of the table shall specify the date when each rate so calculated shall become effective, and shall be effective for all meter readings and/or billings issued for wastewater treatment services rendered on and after the effective date specified therein. The rates set opposite the line of the table labeled "preexisting" are those rates applicable at time of adoption of the ordinance from which this division is derived and until November 1, 2008.

(2)  Provided, however, that any user operating a pre-treatment facility by which waste which is discharged into the wastewater treatment facilities of the city is pretreated by the user to reduce the BOD5 and SS shall pay, in lieu of the basic usage rate (R), as set forth in the above and foregoing table, an amount in accordance with the following table, for all waste discharged, per month, in excess of 300 cubic feet, and such pre-treating user shall not be required to pay the debt service (DS) charge. 
a b Effective Date Rate per 100 Cubic Feet Preexisting $1.80 05-01-2015 $2.00  
(d)  Surcharge rates and charges. The rates of surcharge (S) for BOD5 and SS shall be as follows: 
(1)  For biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), $0.80 per pound of BOD5. 
(2)  For suspended solids (SS), $0.60 per pound of SS. 
(3)  The surcharge per user shall be computed by the following formula: 
S = V (0.006238 [A (BOD5 - 200) + B (SS - 240)] 
where: 
S = Amount of surcharge in dollars. 
V = Wastewater volume in 100 cubic feet per billing. 
(0.006238) = Unit weight of water × 106 per 100 cubic feet. 
A = Unit charge for BOD5 per pound. 
BOD5 = Five-day biochemical oxygen demand in milligrams per liter. 
200 = Allowable average BOD5 concentration in milligrams per liter. 
B = Unit charge for SS per pound. 
SS = Suspended solids in milligrams per liter. 
240 = Allowable average SS concentration in milligrams per liter. 
(e)  Computation of wastewater service charge. Following is the formula for calculating wastewater service charges for users located within the corporate limits: 
(1)  Metered users. 
MC = DS + CI + B + (V - 300) R + RC + (V - 300) P + S 
where: 
MC = Amount of wastewater service charge per billing period; 
DS = Debt service for principal and interest in dollars per billing period; 
CI = Capital improvement charge in dollars per billing period; 
B = Basic usage charge in dollars for use of up to 300 cubic feet of waste discharge per billing period; 
V = Wastewater volume in cubic feet per billing period rounded to the next highest increment of 100 cubic feet. For wastewater volumes of 300 or less cubic feet per billing period, V shall equal 300; 
R = Basic usage rate in dollars per 100 cubic feet of waste discharge per billing; 
RC = Replacement wastewater plant charge in dollars for use of up to 300 cubic feet of waste discharge per billing period; 
P = Replacement plant usage rate in dollars per 100 cubic feet of waste discharge per billing period; and 
S = Amount of wastewater surcharge in dollars as computed by the surcharge formula specified in subsection (d)(2) of this section. 
(2)  Non-metered users. All non-metered users of the wastewater facilities of the city shall pay a minimum flat rate charge, in lieu of calculation by formula, as the wastewater service charge per billing period. The term "non-metered user" means a user not connected to the public water supply system, and whose water consumption is not measured by an installed water usage recordation device. The flat rate charge applied to non-metered users assumes a maximum use of 1,000 cubic feet per billing period, and assumes more than two individuals residing in a residential user unit. Any non-metered residential user may request a reduction in the flat rate charge to be applied per billing period for the reason that the residential unit is occupied on a permanent resident basis by one or two persons. The rate to be applied to non-metered users shall be as set forth in the table in this subsection (e)(2). In order to establish eligibility for a reduced minimum flat rate charge based upon residency by one or two persons, the resident shall be required to provide and exhibit to the utility collection office of the city, each year: 
a.  A copy of that portion of page one of the resident's income tax return showing the number of exemptions claimed upon the return and the number of dependents claimed upon the return; and 
b.  A statement in writing, verified under penalty of perjury, to the supervisor of the utility collection department that the non-metered residential user unit is occupied on a permanent resident basis by only one or two persons, as applicable. 
Any person making a false application for reduced flat rate charge, or a false statement in support of the application for reduced flat rate charge, shall be guilty of a petty offense and upon a finding of guilty, shall be fined an amount not to exceed $500.00. In addition to any fine levied as punishment for violation of this subsection (e)(2), any user making a false application or a false statement in support of an application for reduced flat rate charge shall be required to pay to the city all amounts that would have otherwise been due and owing had the user not been granted the reduced flat rate charge. Each non-metered user requesting flat rate charge shall be required to exhibit annually the proof required by this subsection (e)(2) and to make the verified statement annually as required by this subsection (e)(2) in order to be eligible for continuation of the reduced flat rate charge. If a user fails to supply the annual proof or statement in support of application for reduced flat rate charge, the flat rate charge shall be increased to the amount then in effect for non-metered users, without reduction.

Sec. 32-348. - Purchase power adjustment factor. 
(a)  The charges to all customers under all rates for all kilowatt hours in the billing period shall be increased or decreased by a purchase cost adjustment charge or credit (PPA factor) for each $0.0001 or major fraction thereof by which the average cost of purchased power per kilowatt hour of input to the electrical system exceeds or is less than $0.071 per kilowatt hour. The PPA factor shall be calculated by dividing the annual purchased power costs by the annual purchased and generated (hydroelectric plant) kilowatt hours, and by multiplying the quotient times a loss factor of 1.04 and by then subtracting from the product a base power cost of $0.071 per kilowatt hour. The PPA to be applied to all customer charges shall be determined in March of each year based upon the prior 12 month period (March through February) and shall be effective as to all meter readings and billings rendered on and after the next succeeding May 1. 
    Notwithstanding, the PPA factor for the period July 1, 2017 through April 30, 2018 shall be $0.0003. 
(b)  The formula for calculation of the purchased power adjustment factor shall be: 
PPA = C over K times 1.04 minus $0.071, where: 
C = Total costs of purchased power for the previous period March 1 through February 29 (including Commonwealth Edison Company transmission charges) 
K = total kilowatt hours of purchased power plus hydroelectric plant generated energy for the previous period March 1 through February 29; 
1.04 = the multiplier adjustment for system losses; 
$0.071 = the base power cost. 
(c)  This section 32-348 shall become effective as to all meter readings for electrical energy supplied where the readings of the meter for such energy occur on July 1, 2017 and thereafter, and shall be applied to the billings generated from such meter readings issued thereafter.

Sec. 32-349. - Delayed payment. 
(a)  Each bill for electric energy service which is prepared and sent to any customer of the city shall provide on its face a due date for payment, which due date shall be no longer than 17 days after the date of mailing the bill. If the bill shall not have been paid by the customer on or prior to the due date shown on the face of the monthly bill, then there shall be added to the bill as a late charge an amount equal to five percent of the portion of the bill which is unpaid as of the due date, unless the customer listed on the bill is 65 years or older before the time listed as the due date, or if the customer is receiving federal Social Security Disability and can provide proof of coverage to city staff. If the monthly bill shall not have been paid on or prior to ten days after the due date as shown on the monthly bill, service to the meter shall be disconnected until such time as the bill, any late payment charges and any applicable reconnection charges shall be paid by the customer. The director of electrical utility shall, from time to time, determine the cost incurred and charge necessary to reimburse the city for the expense of reconnecting service following disconnect for non-payment. 
(b)  Any commercial or industrial customer of the electric utility which has incurred or is likely to incur the penalty for late payment provided for in this section may request relief from the late payment penalty under the following circumstances and upon the following conditions: 
(1)  The business conducted by the customer is under financial strain due to loss of business, reduction of revenue, general economic conditions, or extraordinary costs or expenses incurred, and the financial strain is not the result of intentional or willful action by the customer. 
(2)  Strict application of the provisions of subsection (a) of this section may result in the closing of the business conducted by the customer, may result in reduction of work force, layoff or cutback in jobs of the customer, or may have other substantial adverse economic impact upon the community. 
(3)  The customer shall have made written request for relief from the strict application of subsection (a) of this section, which written request shall include the following. 
a.  Financial information of the customer in sufficient detail to support the basis upon which the claim for relief is made; 
b.  Copies of documents in support of the request for relief; 
c.  Documentation and material establishing the amount of salaries paid to owners or principal shareholders of the business during the preceding 12 months; 
d.  Documentation and information evidencing the number of employees, the number of employees or job positions which will be eliminated unless relief is granted, and documentation establishing the amount of payroll which will be affected if relief is not granted; 
e.  Such other and further information and documentation as may from time to time be requested by the committee established in this section. 
(4)  The request for relief submitted by the customer shall be submitted to a committee consisting of the director of electric utilities, the mayor, the director of the customer service office and city accountant. Such committee shall convene as soon as practicable following receipt of the request for relief by a customer, to consider the request, the evidence submitted, and to determine whether the request for relief should be granted. 
(5)  The committee, upon review of the material submitted by the customer, may determine to deny the request for relief, or to grant the request for relief. Relief which may be granted shall include elimination of all delayed payment charges, establishment of a payment schedule for payment of delayed payment charges, reduction of delayed payment charges, establishment of a payment schedule for payment of any delinquent utility charges or such other relief as may from time to time be determined by the committee necessary to avoid substantial negative impact upon the community. Relief shall be granted by the committee only if the committee finds, based upon the evidence submitted, that substantial negative economic impact will result if the relief is not granted. In addition to the evidence and documentation submitted by the customer, the committee shall also consider the impact upon the electric utility resulting from the granting of any relief. 
(6)  The committee shall report the relief granted to the city council and the city council shall have authority to reject and overrule the relief granted. 
(7)  Upon receipt of a request for relief by a customer pursuant to this section, the mayor and director of electrical utilities shall have authority to delay any disconnection for non-payment until the committee shall have been convened and shall have considered the application of the customer. 
(8)  In considering any request for relief by a customer, the committee shall take all steps reasonably available for securing payment of the full amounts due and owing by the customer, to the extent that such security is obtainable.

It shall be the duty of the customer to notify the city utility collection office as to the forwarding address for return of any deposit refund. 
(b)  The city may require that any existing customer of the city make a security deposit in the amounts as provided for herein, if any of the following conditions exist: 
(1)  Service to the customer has been disconnected for nonpayment of charges; 
(2)  Late payment charges have been assessed to the customer four or more times during the preceding 12-month period; 
(3)  The customer is indebted to the city for services under a statement which is past due beyond the time when services ordinarily would have been disconnected under section 32-349; 
(4)  The customer has been found to have tampered with any electric service meter of the city or has obtained electrical service illegally. 
(c)  Any customer required by subsection (b)(1) of this section to pay a security deposit shall pay such security deposit on or before reconnection of service. Any customer required by subsection (b)(2), (3) or (4) of this section shall pay such deposit within ten days after notification of request for payment Upon failure of the customer to pay by or within the time required, the customer shall be disconnected from service in accordance with the provisions of section 32-349, as though the failure to pay security deposit were a delayed payment. Reconnection of the customer shall be in accordance with the provisions of sections 32-25 and 32-349. 
(d)  The amount of the deposit to be paid by the customer shall, in the case of residential service, be an amount equal to one-sixth of the estimated annual charges for average residential service, and in the case of commercial service, shall be an amount equal to one-third of the estimated annual charges for the commercial customer. 
(e)  The city shall have the authority, upon approval of the director of electrical utilities, to waive payment of any deposit by an applicant for electrical service, if any of the following conditions exist: 
(1)  The applicant is a previous customer of the electrical department of the city, and has established a satisfactory payment history, with no late charges being assessed for at least the last two years of the prior service. 
(2)  The applicant is a previous customer of the electrical department of the city, and currently has on deposit with the city a security deposit for the service provided at the previous location.

(4)  The applicant has otherwise provided to the director of electrical utilities satisfactory credit references which establish a strong likelihood the applicant will pay promptly charges for future electrical service. In such case, however, if the applicant shall later fail to pay when due a charge for electrical service, then the city shall have authority to require the customer to make a security deposit to be held pursuant to this section as a guarantee of payment of charges for electrical service to be provided subsequent to the late payment. Failure by the customer to make and pay the deposit to the city within ten days of notification and request for payment of same shall result in disconnection of the service until such time as the security deposit, any late payment charges under section 15-297 and any applicable reconnection charge shall have been paid by the customer. 
(f)  A customer requesting termination or disconnection of electrical service shall promptly pay when due all charges for electrical energy supplied, and shall apply for and request of the city, on forms to be provided by the city, a refund of any excess security deposit of the customer, after application by the city of the deposit towards any outstanding and unpaid charges for electrical service. The city shall have the right to require proof of authority to receive the deposit of any person purporting to act on behalf of the maker of the deposit, as executor, administrator, guardian, or under any power of attorney; provided, however, no refund of excess security deposit shall be made until 30 days after the request has been received by the city. 
(g)  The city council may provide by rule for refund of deposits prior to termination of service to customers with satisfactory payment history. No interest shall be paid to a customer upon refund of any part of a security deposit. 
(h)  An owner of any single-family or multifamily rental dwelling may elect to direct the electric utility office to cause electric service to remain connected and service to be provided to the dwelling following vacation of the dwelling by any tenant, provided that upon such election, the owner of the dwelling shall agree to be responsible for and to pay any charges for electric service furnished following vacation by the tenant. Any owner of residential dwelling so requesting shall be required to make a deposit against future service in the minimum amount of $50.00. If request is not made by the owner of the dwelling for continuance of service following vacation, and if the owner elects to have service disconnected following vacation by a tenant, any reconnect and continuation of service thereafter shall be made only upon payment by the owner of a $25.00 reconnection charge. Such reconnection charge shall not apply to reconnection for a tenant who is a new customer at the dwelling location.

Sec. 34-431. - Special use permits. 
(a)  The development and execution of this chapter is based upon the division of the city into districts, within which districts the use of land and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified in any particular district without consideration of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the particular use at the particular location. Such special uses fall into two categories: 
(1)  Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public interest. 
(2)  Uses entirely private in character but of such unusual nature that operation of the use may give rise to unique problems with respect to the impact upon neighboring property or public facilities. 
No lot or land located within the city shall be utilized for any use which would be characterized as a special use under the above and foregoing definition unless a permit therefor shall have been issued by the city council in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
(b)  Any person, firm or corporation owning or having an interest in a lot or parcel of land may file an application for a special use permit for such lot or land, and such application shall be filed with the office of the city clerk on a form prescribed by the city clerk. The application shall be accompanied by at least three copies of such plans or data as necessary to fully describe and characterize the nature of the use, the location of any improvements to be placed upon the lot or land necessary to the operation of the use, the location of all appurtenances (such as driveways, parking areas, ramps, landscaping, lighting structures, refuse disposal structures or other similar items) necessary for the operation of the use, and the application shall include a statement in writing by the applicant specifying the exact nature of the proposed special use. The application shall further be accompanied by a permit fee payable to the city in the amount of $75.00, which permit fee shall be non-refundable. 
(c)  The application shall be referred by the city council to the plan commission for hearing, to be conducted on notice and in accordance with the requirements applicable to a petition for zoning change. At the hearing scheduled pursuant to this subsection, the applicant shall provide to the plan commission sufficient evidence that the proposed special use will conform to the standards set forth in this section, and at said hearing, persons opposed to the application shall be permitted to offer testimony in opposition thereto or to establish that the standards required by this section will not be met. 
(d)  The plan commission shall not recommend the granting of any application for special use permit, following the hearing to be held pursuant to this section, unless the commission shall find, by majority vote, that: 
(1)  The establishment, maintenance or operation of the special use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort or general welfare. 
(2)  The use for which application is made shall be compatible with existing uses within the district and will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted, nor will the special use substantially diminish or impair values within the neighborhood. 
(3)  The dimensions and topography of the lot or land for which application is made shall be sufficient in size and configuration to accommodate the proposed special use, any required or recommended side, front or rear yards, and any other conditions, yards or set-backs which may be deemed by the plan commission necessary or desirable for the proposed special use. 
(4)  The establishment of the special use will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding property for uses permitted in the district. 
(5)  Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage or other necessary facilities have been or are being provided. 
(6)  Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets. 
(e)  In addition to requirements of subsection (d) of this section, the plan commission shall also recommend to the city council such specific conditions to the granting of the application for special use as the plan commission may deem reasonably necessary or desirable to ensure that the special use will not be detrimental to or endanger public health, safety or general welfare. 
(f)  Following the hearing before the plan commission, the recommendation of the plan commission shall be submitted to the city council for action. At the meeting at which the recommendation is submitted, the applicant shall be permitted to address the city council for elaboration of or explanation of any questions or concerns of members of the city council, and, subject to the discretion of the city council and in conformance with reasonable rules for public comment established by the city council, any opponent of the special use application shall be permitted to address the city council to give testimony or evidence against the granting of the application. 
(g)  If the recommendation of the plan commission is to deny the application for special use, such recommendation shall not be overturned by the city council except upon vote of two-thirds of all elected members of the city council. 
(h)  A special use permit having been granted by the city council pursuant to this section, all construction, improvements and other modifications to the lot or land shall conform strictly to the requirements or conditions made a part of the special use permit, and a failure by the holder of the special use permit to comply with any such conditions shall be cause for proceedings to enforce the terms thereof, and for that purpose, relief by mandatory injunction may be sought. In addition, if any holder of a special use permit shall fail to abide by any of the conditions made applicable to such use, then the special use permit may be revoked by action of the zoning board of appeals, upon hearing and notice given by the building official. 
(i)  If a special use shall not have been established within one year after the date of granting of the permit therefor, then, without further action by the plan commission or the city council, the special use permit shall be null and void. 
(j)  No application for a special use which has been denied wholly or in part by the city council shall be resubmitted for a period of one year from the date of the order of denial, except on the grounds of new evidence or on proof of changed conditions found to be valid by the plan commission and the city council.

The board shall act by resolution, and the concurring vote of four members shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the building official, or to decide in favor of any applicant any matter upon which it is required to pass under this chapter, or to effect any variation in the requirements of this chapter. 
(e)  The board may call on the city departments for assistance in the performance of its duties, and it shall be the duty of such departments to render such assistance to the board as may reasonably be required. 
(f)  Powers of the board. The board shall have jurisdiction in matters and shall have the specific and general powers provided in this article. Where the board is directed to recommend, such recommendations shall be made to the city council for final decision. Any recommendation by the board as authorized by ordinance shall be presented to the city council at the next regularly-convened meeting following the hearing of the board at which the recommendation is made. The report of the board to the city council shall be in writing and shall include a statement of the necessary findings and evidence. The report shall also state the names of all persons appearing before the board in favor of, or opposition to, the proposal. The city council shall have power to adopt, and from time to time, amend rules for the consideration of recommendations from the zoning board of appeals. 
(1)  Special exceptions and interpretation of map. The board shall have the power to hear and recommend, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, requests or applications for special exceptions or for interpretation of the zoning map or for matters upon other special questions upon which the board is authorized to recommend. 
a.  Special exceptions. In addition to recommending the special exceptions heretofore specified in this chapter, the board shall have authority to recommend the following: 
1.  Nonconforming uses. The substitution of a nonconforming use for any other nonconforming use, if no structural alterations except those required by law or ordinance are made; provided, however, that any use so substituted shall be of the same or a more restricted classification. 
2.  Temporary uses and permits. 
(i)  The temporary use of a building or premises in any district for a purpose or use that does not conform to the regulations prescribed by this chapter, provided that such use be of true temporary nature and does not involve the erection of substantial buildings. Such permit shall be granted by city council in the form of a temporary and revocable permit for not more than a 12-month period, subject to such conditions as will safeguard the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare. 
(ii)  The temporary use of a building or premises in undeveloped sections for a purpose that does not conform to the regulations prescribed by this chapter, provided that such structure or use is of a true temporary nature, is promotive of or incidental to the development of such undeveloped sections, and does not involve the erection of a substantial building. Such permit shall be granted by city council in the form specified under subsection (f)(1)a.2.(i) of this section. 
b.  Interpretation of map. Where the street or lot layout actually on the ground or as recorded, differs from the street and lot lines indicated on the zoning map, the board, after notice to the owners of the property and after public hearing, shall interpret the map in such a way as to carry out the intent and purposes of this chapter for the particular section or district in question and recommend action to the city council. 
c.  Certain industries in M-2 districts. In prohibiting certain industries under section 34-404, the board shall give due regard to the nature and condition of all adjacent uses and structures. The board shall determine whether the proposed use would be hazardous, harmful, noxious, offensive, or a nuisance to the surrounding neighborhood by reason of noise, smoke, odor, vibration, dust or dirt, noxious gases, glare and health, fire and safety hazards, wastes, electromagnetic radiation and transportation of traffic. The board may utilize and give recognition to those performance standards which are available in model codes or ordinances, or have been developed by planning, manufacturing, health, architectural and engineering research organizations, and can be applied to the proposed use, to assist the city council in reaching a fair and objective decision. 
d.  Communications tower special use. The granting of a special use for a communications tower is subject to the following provisions which are intended to allow communications towers for mobile telephone services and other radio and television information services while minimizing adverse visual and operations effects of such towers through careful design, placement and screening; to avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure and falling ice, through engineering and careful siting; and, to maximize use of any new communications towers to reduce the number of towers needed, and the board, in determining whether to recommend to the city council the granting of an application for siting of a communications tower, shall consider and make findings upon the following specific requirements: 
1.  The applicant shall demonstrate, using technological evidence, that the communication tower must be placed where proposed in order to satisfy and perform its intended function. 
2.  If the applicant proposes to construct or build a new tower (as opposed to mounting the antenna on an existing structure), the applicant shall demonstrate that he or she has contacted the owners of tall structures within a one-quarter-mile radius of the site proposed, has asked for permission to install the antenna on those structures, and was denied permission for reasons other than economic. Structures contemplated shall include smoke stacks, water towers, tall buildings, antenna support structures of other cellular communications companies, other communication towers (fire, police, etc.), and other tall structures. The board may recommend denial of the application if the applicant has not made a good faith effort to mount the antenna on an existing structure which is suitable for that purpose. 
3.  The applicant shall demonstrate that the tower and antenna are the minimum height required to function satisfactorily. 
4.  All setbacks required shall be measured from the base of the tower to the property line or street right-of-way. If a tower is proposed to be placed on a leased portion of a larger lot which is owned by someone other than the tower owner, setbacks shall be measured from the boundaries of such larger lot and: 
(i)  Communication towers must be set back from all property lines by a minimum distance of 100 percent of the height of the tower plus 25 feet; and 
(ii)  No setbacks shall be required if the antenna is to be located on an existing structure. 
5.  A separation of 1,500 feet shall be required to be maintained between communications towers (measured by drawing a straight line between the base of the existing tower and the base of the proposed tower as shown on the site plan). 
6.  The applicant shall demonstrate that the communications tower and antenna will be constructed in a structurally sound and safe manner, and that surrounding areas will not be negatively affected by support structure failure, falling ice or other debris, electromagnetic fields, or radio frequency interference. All communication towers shall be fitted with anti-climbing devices, as approved by the manufacturer thereof. 
7.  A fence of not less than eight feet in height shall be required around the base of the communication tower. 
8.  Landscaping shall be required to screen as much as possible the support structure, the fence surrounding the support structure, and any other ground level features (such as a building), including: 
(i)  An evergreen screen shall be required to surround the site. The screen may be either hedge (planted three feet on center maximum) or a row of evergreen trees (planted ten feet on center maximum). The evergreen screen shall be a minimum height of six feet at planting, and shall grow to a minimum of 15 feet at maturity; 
(ii)  Any combination of existing vegetation, topography, walls, decorative fences or other features may be used if the same degree of screening is achieved as the required landscaping; 
(iii)  In addition, existing vegetation on and around the site shall be preserved to the greatest extent possible. 
9.  Adequate on-site parking shall be required for all maintenance operations. 
10.  Unless the FAA imposes specific marking requirements, all communications towers shall be silver or shall have a galvanized finish in order to reduce visual impact. 
11.  No communications towers shall be artificially lighted except when required by the FAA. If lighting is required, dual mode lighting (intermittent red lighting for nighttime use and high intensity lighting for daytime use) shall be installed. Security lighting shall be permitted at ground level, provided that all lighting shall be designed so as not to project onto surrounding residential property. 
12.  All other uses ancillary to the communications towers and associated equipment (including a business office, maintenance depot, vehicle storage, etc.) are prohibited unless otherwise permitted in the zoning district in which the tower is located. 
13.  No commercial advertising or signs shall be allowed on communications towers. 
14.  A small site plan shall be provided to the city for all communications towers, showing the site boundaries, type and elevation of tower, fencing, buffering, access, lighting and any buildings or other ancillary equipment. 
15.  The city may impose additional restrictions to ensure that the purpose and intent of this section is met. Such restrictions may include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following: 
(i)  Alternate colors; 
(ii)  All additional setback; 
(iii)  Type of construction (e.g., monopole vs. lattice); 
(iv)  Site lighting requirements; 
(v)  Location of accessory buildings; 
(vi)  Additional landscaping or buffer. 
(2)  Administrative review and variances. The board of appeals also shall have power to: 
a.  Administrative review. To hear appeals where it is alleged by the appellant that there is error in any order, requirement, decision, grant or refusal made by the building official in the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and to recommend action to the city council. 
b.  Variances. To recommend to the city council after appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest, where owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of this chapter shall be observed and substantial justice done, as follows: 
1.  Where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of a specific piece of property at the time of enforcement of this chapter, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions, or other extraordinary and exceptional situation or condition of such piece of property, or of the use or development of property immediately adjoining the piece of property in question, the literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter would result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties or exceptional and undue hardship upon the owner of such property, unnecessary to carry out the spirit and purpose of this chapter, the board shall have the power to recommend, upon appeal, a variance from such strict application, so as to relieve such difficulties of hardships, and so that the spirit and purpose of this chapter shall be observed and substantial justice done. In recommending a variance the board may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location, character, and other features of the proposed building, structure or use as it may deem advisable in the interest of the furtherance of the purposes of this chapter. 
2.  No such variance in the provisions or requirements of this chapter shall be authorized by the city council unless the council finds by clear and convincing evidence that all of the following conditions exist: 
(i)  That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applying to the property in question or to the intended use of the property that do not apply generally to other properties or class of uses in the same zoning district. 
(ii)  That such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right possessed by other properties in the same zoning district and in the vicinity. 
(iii)  The authorizing of such variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property and will not materially impair the purposes of this chapter or the public interest. 
3.  No grant or variance shall be authorized unless the city council finds that the condition or situation of the specific piece of property for which the variance is sought is not of so typical or recurrent a nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation, under an amendment of this chapter, for conditions or situations. 
4.  The council shall have no power to authorize a variance for the establishment of a nonconforming use where none previously existed. 
(3)  City council action. No variation in any specific case shall be made by the city council without a hearing by the zoning board of appeals as required in section 34-541(c) nor without a report thereof having been made by the board to the city council, and every such report shall be accompanied by a finding of fact specifying the reasons for the report. Upon the report of the zoning board of appeals, the city council, without further public hearing, may adopt or deny any proposed variation or may refer the report back to the board for further consideration. Any proposed variation which fails to receive the approval of the four members of the zoning board of appeals shall not be passed except by the favorable vote of three-fourths of all the elected members of the city council. In making any variations the city council shall be governed by the same considerations and restrictions as the variations in particular instances under subsection (f)(2)b of this section.

(e)  An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealled from, unless the building official certifies to the board that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would in his opinion cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by an order which may, on due cause shown, be granted by the board on application, after notice to the building official, or by a court of competent jurisdiction.
