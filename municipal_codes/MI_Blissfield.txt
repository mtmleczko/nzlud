PREFACE 
    This is a compilation of the ordinances of the Village of Blissfield, Michigan, which includes currently operative ordinances, compiled with all amendments through and including the ordinance adopted June 28, 1999. The chapters of the Village Code of 1970 and individual ordinances not part of the Code have been integrated by subject matter in this compilation. Cable television franchise ordinances and revenue bond ordinances have not been printed due to their length and temporary nature; copies of these ordinances are available in the office of the Village Clerk. 
    The chronological listing of all ordinances, including title and location within the compilation, reflects all ordinances adopted, amended or repealed, thus providing a valuable record of the municipality's ordinance history. Ordinances which are printed in their entirety are classified by subject matter and assigned to one of eleven basic categories. Each of these categories is indicated by a tab. Every ordinance is introduced with a part number, a title concerning the content, the chapter number or ordinance date, and the adoption date. 
    Section headings in boldface type have been provided, if not supplied in the original copy, to facilitate usage. Sections that are subsequently amended are followed by a history note indicating the adoption date of the amendment. Cross reference notations are included to provide quick referral to other ordinances and/or sections dealing with similar subjects. 
    Running heads at the top of the page contain an abbreviated title, the chapter number or ordinance date and section numbers to provide a guide for locating specific information quickly. The section number appearing in the running head on the left-hand page cites the section material beginning the page; the number on the right-hand page cites the section material concluding the page. 
    The exact wording of the ordinances has been preserved. Since ordinances are legal documents, editorial changes in a compilation are minor, limited primarily to correction of obvious typographical errors and resolving, upon specific instructions from the municipality, any duplications and inconsistencies brought to their attention during the preparation of the proof copy of the compilation. Any additions to text by the editor appear in brackets. 
Numbering system 
    Each ordinance is assigned a part number. The part number is used to identify the ordinance primarily for indexing and cross reference purposes. Each succeeding article and/or section deriving from that ordinance will have the same number on the left-hand side of the decimal point. For example, section number 12.004 refers to section 4 of the ordinance assigned to part 12. Part numbers allow for expansion within each of the categories and within the compilation as a whole. 
Index 
    The alphabetical index permits easy location of ordinances by subject. Main entries are in all uppercase letters. Under the entry for each ordinance, the catchlines of all sections appear in lowercase, indented and alphabetized. Cross references and additional entries are provided where necessary to direct the user to a particular topic. In preparing the index the proper balance has been achieved between creating an index comprehensive enough to be useful and yet not so detailed that it requires extensive revision each time an ordinance is enacted, repealed, or amended. 
Looseleaf supplements 
    Since an ordinance compilation, unlike a bound book, is constantly in a state of evolution, a special feature of this compilation is the looseleaf system of binding. With this system, the compilation can easily be kept up-to-date by submitting copies of new ordinances or amendments as they are enacted. These will then be incorporated by the editor into the compilation, and the appropriate pages will be revised or created for distribution to the holders of copies, with specific instructions for the manner of removing obsolete pages and inserting the current ones. Through regular supplementation, the compilation will continue to remain current and useful.

Such award may be by resolution or ordinance. The Council shall have the right to reject any or all bids and to waive irregularities in bidding and to accept bids which do not conform in every respect to the bidding requirements.

The Council may correct said roll as to any special assessment or description of any lot or parcel of land or other errors appearing therein; or it may, by resolution, annul such assessment roll and direct that new proceedings be instituted.

If, after hearing all objections and making a record of such changes as the Council deems justified, the Council determines that it is satisfied with said special assessment roll and that assessments are in proportion to benefits received, it shall thereupon pass a resolution reciting such determinations, confirming such roll, placing it on file in the office of the Village Clerk and directing the Village Clerk to attach his warrant to a certified copy thereof within ten days, therein commanding the Treasurer to spread and the Treasurer to collect the various sums and amounts appearing thereon as directed by the Council.

    Sec. 1.125. All special assessments, except such installments thereof as the Council shall make payable at a future time as provided in this Chapter, shall be due and payable upon confirmation of the special assessment roll. 
3.126 - Partial payments-When due. 
    Sec. 1.126. The Council may provide for the payment of special assessments in annual installments. Such annual installments shall not exceed ten in number, the first installment being due upon confirmation of the roll or on such date as the Council may determine and deferred installments being due annually thereafter, or in the discretion of the Council, may be spread upon and made a part of each annual Village tax roll thereafter until all are paid. Interest shall be charged on all deferred installments at a rate not to exceed seven percent per annum, commencing on the due date of the first installment and payable on the due date of each subsequent installment; the full amount of all or any deferred installments, with interest accrued thereon to the date of payment, may be paid in advance of the due dates thereof. If the full assessment or the first installment thereof shall be due upon confirmation, each property owner shall have 60 days from the date of confirmation to pay the full amount of said assessment, or the full amount of any installments thereof, without interest or penalty. Following said 60 day period, the assessment or first installment thereof shall, if unpaid, be considered as delinquent and the same penalties shall be collected on such unpaid assessments or first installments thereof as are provided in the Village Charter to be collected on delinquent general Village taxes. Deferred installments shall be collected without penalty until 60 days after the due date thereof, after which time such installments shall be considered as delinquent and such penalties on said installments shall be collected as are provided in the Village Charter to be collected on delinquent general Village taxes. After the Council has confirmed the roll, the Village Treasurer shall notify by mail each property owner on said roll that said roll has been filed, stating the amount assessed and the terms of payment. Failure on the part of the Village Treasurer to give said notice or of such owner to receive said notice shall not invalidate any special assessment roll of the Village or any assessment thereon, nor excuse the payment of interest or penalties. 
3.127 - Delinquent special assessments. 
    Sec. 1.127. Any assessment, or part thereof, remaining unpaid on the first Monday of March following the date when the same became delinquent shall be reported as unpaid by the Treasurer to the Council.

Delinquent assessments may also be collected by a suit against the person. 
3.128 - Creation of lien. 
    Sec. 1.128. Special assessments and all interest, penalties and charges thereon from the date of confirmation of the roll shall become a debt to the Village from the persons to whom they are assessed, and, until paid, shall be and remain a lien upon the property assessed, of the same character and effect as the lien created by general law for State and County taxes and by the Village Charter for Village taxes, and the lands upon which the same are a lien shall be subject to sale therefor the same as are lands upon which delinquent Village taxes constitute a lien. 
3.129 - Additional assessments, refunds. 
    Sec. 1.129. The Village Clerk shall, within 60 days after the completion of each local or special public improvement, compile the actual cost thereof and certify the same to the Treasurer who shall adjust the special assessment roll to correspond therewith. Should the assessment prove larger than necessary by five percent or less, the same shall be reported to the Council which may place the excess in the Village treasury or make a refund thereof pro rata according to the assessment. If the assessment exceeds the amount necessary by more than five percent, the entire excess shall be credited to owners of property as shown by the Village assessment roll upon which such assessment has been levied, pro rata according to the assessment; provided, however, that no refunds of special assessments may be made which impair, or contravene the provisions of any outstanding obligation or bond secured in whole or part by such special assessments. When any special assessment roll shall prove insufficient to meet the cost of the improvement for which it was made, the Council may make an additional pro rata assessment, but the total amount assessed against any one parcel of land shall not exceed the benefits received by said lot or parcel of land. 
(Amended: 1-22-01) 
3.130 - Additional procedures. 
    Sec. 1.130. In any case where the provisions of this Chapter may prove to be insufficient to carry out fully the making of any special assessment, the Council shall provide by ordinance any additional steps or procedures required. 
3.131 - Collection of special assessments. 
    Sec. 1.131. In the event bonds are issued in anticipation of the collection of special assessments as hereinbefore provided, all collections on each special assessment roll or combination of rolls shall be set in a separate fund for the payment of the principal and interest on the bonds so issued in anticipation of the payment of such special assessments, and shall be used for no other purpose. 
3.132 - Special assessment accounts. 
    Sec. 1.132. Moneys raised by special assessment to pay the cost of any local improvements shall be held in a special fund to pay such cost or to repay any money borrowed therefor. Each special assessment account must be used only for the improvement project for which the assessment was levied, expenses incidental thereto, including the repayment of the principal and interest on money borrowed therefor, and to refund excessive assessments, if refunds be authorized. 
3.133 - Contested assessments. 
    Sec. 1.133. No suit or action of any kind shall be constituted or maintained for the purpose of contesting or enjoining the collection of any special assessment (1) unless within forty-five (45) days after the confirmation of the special assessment roll, written notice is given to the Council of intention to file such suit or action, stating the grounds on which it is claimed such assessment is illegal, and (2) unless such suit or action shall be commenced within 90 days after confirmation of the roll. 
3.134 - Reassessment for benefits. 
    Sec. 1.134. Whenever the Council shall deem any special assessment invalid or defective for any reason whatever, or if any court of competent jurisdiction shall have adjudged such assessment to be illegal for any reason whatever, in whole or in part, the Council shall have power to cause a new assessment to be made for the same purpose for which the former assessment was made, whether the improvement or any part thereof has been completed and whether any part of the assessment has been collected or not. All proceedings on such reassessment and for the collection thereof shall be made in the manner as provided for the original assessment. If any portion of the original assessment shall have been collected and not refunded, it shall be applied upon the reassessment and the reassessment shall to that extent be deemed satisfied. If more than the amount reassessed shall have been collected, the balance shall be refunded to the person making such payment. 
3.135 - Combination of projects. 
    Sec. 1.135. The Council may combine several districts into one project for the purpose of effecting a saving in the costs; provided, however, that for each district there shall be established separate funds and accounts to cover the cost of the same. 
3.136 - Deferred payments of special assessments. 
    Sec. 1.136. The Council may provide for the deferred payment of special assessments from persons, who, in the opinion of the Council and Treasurer, by reason of poverty are unable to contribute toward the cost thereof. In all such cases, as a condition to the granting of such deferred payments, the Village shall require mortgage security on the real property of the beneficiary payable on or before his death, or, in any event, on the sale or transfer of the property. 
(Amended: 1-22-01) 
3.137 - Reconsideration of petitions. 
    Sec. 1.137. In the event that the Council shall fail to make any public improvement petitioned for under the provisions of section 1.114 hereof during the calendar year during which any petition is filed, such petition shall be reconsidered by the Council prior to the first day of March of the succeeding calendar year for the purpose of determining whether such improvement should be made during such calendar year.

    Sec. 1.138. When any lot, building, or structure within the Village, because of the accumulation of refuse or debris, the uncontrolled growing weeds, or age or dilapidation, or because of any other condition or happening, becomes, in the opinion of the Council, a public hazard or nuisance which is dangerous to the health or safety of the inhabitants of the Village or those of them residing or habitually going near such lot, building or structure, the Council may, after investigation, give notice to the owner of the land upon which such hazard or nuisance exists, or the owner of the building or structure itself, specifying the nature of the hazard or nuisance, and requiring such owner to alter, repair, tear down, or remove same promptly and within a time to be specified by the Council, which shall be commensurate with the nature of the hazard or nuisance. If, at the expiration of the time limit in said notice, said owner has not complied with the requirements thereof, or in any case where the owner of the land or of the building or structure itself is not known, the Council may order such a hazard or nuisance abated by the proper department or agency of the Village which is qualified to do the work required, and the costs of such abatement assessed against the lot, premises or description of real property upon which said hazard or nuisance was located. 
3.139 - Single lot assessments. 
    Sec. 1.139. When any expense shall have been incurred by the Village upon or in respect to any single premises, which expense is chargeable against said premises and the owner thereof under the provisions of this Code and Village Charter and is not of that class required to be pro-rated among the several lots and parcels of land in a special assessment district, an account of the labor, material and service for which such expense was incurred, with a description of the premises upon or in respect to which the expense was incurred, and the name of the owner, if known, shall be reported to the Treasurer, who shall immediately charge and bill the owner, if known. The Treasurer at the end of each quarter shall report to the Village Council all sums so owing to the Village and which have not been paid within 30 days after the mailing of the bill therefor. The Council shall, at such times as it may deem advisable direct the Treasurer to prepare a special assessment roll covering all such charges reported to it together with a penalty of ten percent. Such roll shall be filed with the Clerk who shall advise the Council of the filing of the same, and the Council shall thereupon set a date for the hearing of objections to such assessment roll. The assessment roll shall be open to public inspection for a period of seven days before the Council shall meet to review the roll and hear complaints. The Village Clerk shall give notice in advance by publication of the opening of the roll to public inspection and of the meeting of the Council to hear complaints and shall also give like notice to the owners of and persons having an interest in property affected by first class mail at their addresses as shown on the last general assessment roll of the Village, at least ten full days prior to the date of such hearing. Such special assessments and all interest and charge's thereon, shall, from the date of confirmation of the roll, be and remain a lien upon the property assessed, of the same character and effect as a lien created by general law for state and county taxes, until paid. The same penalty and interest shall be paid on such assessments, when delinquent from such date after confirmation as shall be fixed by the Council, as are provided by the Village Charter to be paid on delinquent general Village taxes and such assessments, with penalties and interest, shall be added by the Treasurer to the next general Village Tax Roll and shall thereafter, be collected and returned in the same manner as general Village taxes.

All other words and phrases used in this Ordinance shall have the same meaning as defined in the Act and FCC Rules. 
28.002 - Purpose; interpretation. 
    Sec. 2. The purpose of this Ordinance is to: 1) adopt regulations consistent with the Act and the FCC Rules with respect to basic cable service rate regulation, and 2) prescribe procedures to provide a reasonable opportunity for consideration of the views of interested parties in connection with basic cable service rate regulation by the Village. This Ordinance shall be implemented and interpreted consistent with the Act and FCC Rules. 
28.003 - Rate regulations promulgated by FCC. 
    Sec. 3. In connection with the regulation of rates for basic cable service and associated equipment, the Village of Blissfield shall follow all FCC Rules. 
28.004 - Filing; additional information; burden of proof. 
    Sec. 4. 
(a)  A cable operator shall submit its schedule of rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment or a proposed increase in such rates in accordance with the Act and the FCC Rules. The cable operator shall include as part of its submission such information as is necessary to show that its schedule of rates or its proposed increase in rates complies with the Act and the FCC Rules. The cable operator shall file ten copies of the schedule or proposed increase with the Village Clerk. For purposes of this Ordinance, the filing of the cable operator shall be deemed to have been made when at least ten copies have been received by the Village Clerk. The Village Council may, by resolution or otherwise, adopt rules and regulations prescribing the information, data and calculations which must be included as part of the cable operator's filing of the schedule of rates or a proposed increase. 
(b)  In addition to information and data required by rules and regulations of the Village pursuant to Section 4(a) [28.004(a)] above, a cable operator shall provide all information requested by the Village Council in connection with the Village's review and regulation of existing rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment or a proposed increase in these rates. The Village Council may establish deadlines for submission of the requested information and the cable operator shall comply with such deadlines.

(a)  If this Ordinance, any rules or regulations adopted by the Village pursuant to Section 4(a) [28.004(a)], or any request for information pursuant to Section 4(b) [28.004(b)] requires the production of proprietary information, the cable operator shall produce the information. However, at the time the allegedly proprietary information is submitted, the cable operator may request that specific, identified portions of its response be treated as confidential and withheld from public disclosure. The request must state the reason why the information should be treated as proprietary and the facts that support those reasons. The request for confidentiality will be granted if the Village determines that the preponderance of the evidence shows that non-disclosure is consistent with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C.  552. The Village shall place in a public file for inspection any decision that results in information being withheld. If the cable operator requests confidentiality and the request is denied, (1) where the cable operator is proposing a rate increase, it may withdraw the proposal, in which case the allegedly proprietary information will be returned to it; or (2) the cable operator may seek review within five working days of the denial in any appropriate forum. Release of the information will be stayed pending review. 
(b)  Any interested party may file a request to inspect material withheld as proprietary with the Village. The Village shall weigh the policy considerations favoring non-disclosure against the reasons cited for permitting inspection in light of the facts of the particular case. It will then promptly notify the requesting entity and the cable operator that submitted the information as to the disposition of the request. It may grant, deny or condition a request. The requesting party or the cable operator may seek review of the decision by filing an appeal with any appropriate forum. Disclosure will be stayed pending resolution of any appeal.

NOW THEREFORE THE VILLAGE OF BLISSFIELD HEREBY ORDAINS: 
195.010 - ARTICLE 1 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE, AND OBJECTIVES 

195.011 - Statutory authorization. 
    Sec. A. This Ordinance is adopted to secure the public health, welfare, and safety. 
195.012 - Findings of fact. 
    Sec. B. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the Village of Blissfield are subject to periodic inundation which could result in potential loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which would adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These potential flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in flood plains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
195.013 - Statement of purpose. 
    Sec. C. It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Control the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and, 
(5)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
195.014 - Objectives. 
    Sec. D. The objectives of this Ordinance are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in flood plains; 
(6)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and, 
(7)  To provide a means whereby potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.

(5)  In passing upon such applications, the Board of Appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this ordinance. 
    A.  Evaluation criteria: 
(1)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(2)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to the flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(4)  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
(5)  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
(6)  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; 
(7)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(8)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and flood plain management program for that area; 
(9)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(10)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site, and 
(11)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
    B.  Stipulations on criteria: Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, provided items (1-11) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(1)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this ordinance, the Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance. 
(2)  Variances will be required within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(3)  Conditions for variances: 
(a)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(b)  Variances shall only be issued upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause; (ii) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and, (iii) a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(c)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(d)  The Building Inspector shall maintain the records of appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request.

No lot in a recorded plat shall be divided into more than four parts and the resulting lots shall be not less in area than permitted by the zoning ordinance. No building permit shall be issued, or any building construction commenced, until the division has been approved by the Village Planning Commission and the suitability of the land for building sites has been approved by the Village Planning Commission. The division of a lot resulting in a smaller area than prescribed herein may be permitted, but only for the purpose of adding to the existing building site or sites. The application shall so state and shall be in affidavit form. 
9.1.  Division of unplatted parcel. The division of an unplatted parcel of land into two, three or four lots involving the dedication of a new street shall require the approval of the Planning Commission and Village Council prior to taking such action.

4.  Lots, Yards and Open Spaces. No space which for the purpose of a building has been counted or calculated as part of a side yard, rear yard, front yard, or other open space, including required lot area per dwelling unit, required by this Ordinance, may, by reason of change in ownership or otherwise, be counted or calculated to satisfy or comply with a yard or other open space or lot area requirements for any other building.

216.1302 - Non-conforming lots, non-conforming uses of land, non-conforming structures and non-conforming uses of structures and premises. 
    Sec. 13.02. Intent and Purpose. 
    It is recognized that there exists within the districts established by this ordinance or amendments that may later be adopted, lots, structures, and uses of land and structures which were lawful before this ordinance was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this ordinance. 
    It is the intent of this ordinance to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. Such uses are declared by this ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. It is further the intent of this ordinance that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
    It is further recognized that certain nonconforming uses and structures do not significantly depress the value of nearby properties and are not contrary to the public health, safety and welfare and that such use or structure was lawful at the time of its inception and that no useful purpose would be served by the strict application of requirements for nonconformities under this ordinance and, therefore, two (2) classes of nonconforming use and structure are designated, being Class A and Class B. All nonconforming uses and structures are classified as Class B nonconforming uses or structures unless designated Class A nonconforming uses or structures. 
1.  Class B nonconforming uses and structures. All nonconforming uses or structures not designated Class A shall be Class B nonconforming uses or structures. Class B nonconforming uses and structures shall comply with all the provisions of this Article relative to nonconforming uses and structures. 
2.  Class A nonconforming uses and structures. Nonconforming uses or structures shall be designated Class A providing that the Planning Commission finds all of the following exist with respect to the use or structure: 
A.  The use or structure was lawful at its inception. 
B.  Continuance of the use or structure is not likely to significantly depress property values of nearby properties. 
C.  Continuance of the use or structure would not be contrary to the public health, safety or welfare or the spirit of the ordinance. 
D.  No useful purpose would be served by strict application of the provisions of this ordinance with which the use or structure does not conform. 
3.  Class A conditions. The decision to grant a Class A designation shall be made in writing setting forth its findings of fact and basis for the designation. For changes or improvements to a Class A use or structure, site plans shall be required and the Planning Commission may condition its approval on the following, and by the following procedure to assure the public health, safety or welfare or the spirit and purpose of this ordinance: 
(A)  Conditions: 
(1)  Screening and landscaping in keeping with community standards to provide compatibility with adjacent uses. 
(2)  Restrictions on lighting, noise, or visual impact. 
(3)  Prohibition of curbside parking to an extent greater than the immediate property frontage of the nonconforming use, where such use is in close proximity to homes. 
(4)  Signage in compliance with zoning district requirements. Existing nonconforming signs may be required to be eliminated or reduced in size and number. 
(5)  Exterior building materials utilized in any alteration or rebuilding of the building shall be harmonious with materials on abutting properties whenever practical. 
(6)  Enlargement or replacement of a building that does not create a more nonconforming yard setback condition which would impact on conforming properties in the immediate vicinity. 
(7)  Other reasonable safeguards and improvements imposed to protect conforming uses in the surrounding area. 
(B)  Procedure: 
(1)  A Class A designation shall be deemed temporary until the Planning Commission has received written verification from the Zoning Administrator that the party requesting the Class A designation has complied with all of the conditions set forth by the Planning Commission. 
(2)  Once the Planning Commission has received written verification from the Zoning Administrator that the party requesting the Class A designation has complied with said conditions, the Class A designation shall become final, subject to other provisions of this ordinance as hereafter prescribed. 
(3)  No Class A nonconforming use or structure shall be resumed if it has been discontinued for six (6) consecutive months, or eighteen (18) months total in any three-year period. No Class A nonconforming use or structure shall be used, altered or enlarged in violation of any conditions imposed in its designation. 
(4)  A temporary Class A nonconforming use or structure designation shall be void after six (6) months if any conditions imposed by the Designation remain unmet, unless the Planning Commission grants a written request for an extension of six (6) months. No more than two (2) extensions may be granted. 
4.  Nonconforming Use of Structures and Land. A non-conforming use of a structure, a non-conforming use of land, or a non-conforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this Ordinance by attachment of a building or premises or additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by addition of other uses of a nature which would not be permitted generally in the district involved. 
To avoid undue hardship, nothing within this Ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance and upon which actual building construction has been diligently carried on. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner; except that where demolition or removal of an existing building has been subsequently begun preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the building involved. 
A.  Non-Conforming Lots of Record (Substandard Lots). In any district in which one-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Ordinance, a one-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district; provided that yard dimensions and other requirements not involving area or width or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Yard requirement variances may be obtained through approval of the Zoning Board of Appeals. 
B.  Non-Conforming Structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance that could not be built under the terms of this Ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(a)  No such non-conforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its non-conformity. 
(b)  Should such structure be moved for any reason whatever, it shall hereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
C.  Non-Conforming Uses of Land. Where at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Ordinance lawful use of land exists which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this Ordinance, the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided:

216.1314 - Flood plains. 
    Sec. 13.14. The Village of Blissfield wishes to reduce hazards to persons and damage to property as a result of flooding conditions within its boundaries and to comply with the provisions and requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program, enabled by the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, and rules and regulations promulgated in furtherance of this program by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as published in the Federal Register on May 31, 1979. Public Act 203 of 1979 of the State of Michigan and Act 346 of 1972 of the State of Michigan, all adopted in the ordinance by reference. 
    The 100-year flood plain control, shown on the Official Zoning Map of the Village of Blissfield contains the 100-year floodway, the 100-year floodplain, and area of the 100-year floodplain with average depths of less than one foot as defined by the February 17, 1988 Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). 
    No new development, construction or fill materials shall occur within the 100-year floodway boundaries. Only park and recreational activities, open space and agricultural uses are permitted within the floodway, no matter what the zoning district is. 
    Any development outside the floodway but within the 100-year floodplain shall not displace base flood elevations, as defined by the 1988 FIRM, more than one foot. All first floor elevations and street or driveway grades shall be one foot above the 1988 FIRM base flood elevation. 
    Any person desiring a building permit or site plan approval must first request a flood plain determination from the zoning administrator and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR). If the parcel(s) in question is determined to be completely outside the 100-year floodplain, then a permit can be issued or the review process begun. If any of the parcel is determined to be within the 100-year floodplain, then detailed (two-foot contour) topography map and sufficient hydrologic/hydraulic analysis shall be required that will define the 100-year floodplain contours and safe first floor elevations for the structures. Application to the Village does not relieve the applicant of the responsibility of also applying to the DNR as well.

(Amended: 9-28-09) 
216.1316 - Special land uses. 
    Sec. 13.16. The formulation and enactment of this Ordinance is based upon the division of the Village of Blissfield into districts in each of which may be permitted specific uses which are mutually compatible and special land uses. Special land uses are those uses of land which are not essentially incompatible with the uses permitted in a zoning district, but possess characteristics or locational qualities which require individual review and restriction in order to avoid incompatibility with the natural environment of the site, the character of the surrounding area, public services and facilities, and adjacent uses of land. The purpose of this section is to establish equitable procedures and criteria which shall be applied in the determination of requests to establish special land uses. The standards for approval and requirements provided for under the provisions of this section shall be in addition to others required elsewhere in this Ordinance and at the same time provide to the Village and the developer some latitude to address site issues in an innovative manner. 
1.  Authority to Grant Permits. The Planning Commission as hereinafter provided shall have the authority to approve, deny, or approve with conditions as specified in Subsection 13.16.5 [216.1316 5.], special land uses.

Application for any special land use permit permissible under the provision of this Ordinance shall be made to the Planning Commission through the Village Clerk by filing an official special land use permit application form and submitting a site plan in accordance with Section 13.07 [216.1307]. 
3.  Public Hearing for Special Land Uses. After a preliminary review of the site plan and an application for a special land use permit, the Planning Commission shall hold a hearing on the site plan and special land use permit. 
(a)  Notice of the hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the Village and shall be sent by mail or personal delivery to the owners of property for which approval is being considered, to all persons whose real property is assessed within 300 feet of the boundary of the property in question, and to the occupants of all structures within 300 feet, except that the notice shall be given not less than fifteen (15) days before the application will be considered at a public hearing. If the name of the occupant is not known, the term "occupant" may be used in making notification. Notification need not be given to more than one occupant of a structure, except that if a structure contains more than one dwelling unit or spatial area owned or leased by different individuals, partnerships, businesses or organizations, one occupant of each unit or spatial area shall receive notice. In the case of a single structure containing more than four dwelling units or other distinct spatial areas owned or leased by different individuals, partnerships, businesses, or organizations, notice may be given to the manager or owner of the structure who shall be requested to post the notice at the primary entrance to the structure. The notice shall: 
(1)  Describe the nature of the request; 
(2)  Indicate the property which is the subject of the request; 
(3)  State when, where and at what time the public hearing on the request will be considered; and 
(4)  Indicate when and where written comments will be received concerning the request. 
4.  Required Standards and Findings for Making Determinations. The Planning Commission shall review the particular circumstances of the special land use request under consideration in accordance with the requirements of Section 13.07 [216.1307], Site Plan Review, and shall approve the special land use request only upon approval of the site plan and finding of compliance with the following standards: 
(a)  The use shall be designed, constructed, operated and maintained in a manner harmonious with the character of adjacent property and the surrounding area. 
(b)  The use shall not inappropriately change the essential character of the surrounding area. 
(c)  The establishment of the special land use will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvements of the surrounding property for uses permitted in the district. 
(d)  The use shall not interfere with the general enjoyment of adjacent property. 
(e)  The use shall represent an improvement to the use or character of the property under consideration and the surrounding area in general, yet also be in keeping with the natural environment of the site. 
(f)  The use shall not be hazardous to adjacent properties, or involve uses, activities, materials or equipment which will be detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare of persons or property through the excessive production of traffic, noise, smoke, odor, fumes, glare, or dust. 
(g)  The use shall be adequately served by essential public facilities and services, or it shall be demonstrated that the person responsible for the proposed use shall be able to continually provide adequately for the services and facilities deemed essential to the use under consideration. 
(h)  Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage, parking, lighting, storage, refuse removal, easements, play areas, open space, landscaping and snow removal and all necessary facilities as determined by the Village have been or are being provided. 
(i)  Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress or egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets. 
(j)  The use shall not place demands on public services and facilities in excess of current capacity. 
(k)  The use shall meet the provisions of the zoning district provisions in which said special land use is located and other applicable standards contained in provisions of this or other applicable ordinances or laws. 
5.  Determination and Imposition of Conditions. A review of an application and site plan requesting a special land use permit shall be made by the Planning Commission in accordance with the procedures and standards specified in this Ordinance. If a submitted application and site plan do not meet the requirements of the Ordinance, they shall not be approved. However, if the applicant agrees to make changes to the site plan and application in order to bring them into compliance with the Ordinance, such changes shall be allowed and shall be either noted on the application or site plan itself, or attached to it, or these documents shall be resubmitted incorporating said changes. If the facts in the case do not establish competent material and substantial evidence that the standards set forth in this Ordinance will apply to the proposed special land use, the Planning Commission shall not grant a special land use permit. The Planning Commission may impose conditions with the approval of a special land use permit application and site plan which are necessary to ensure compliance with the standards for approval stated in this section and any other applicable standards contained in this or other applicable ordinances and regulations. Such conditions shall be considered an integral part of the special land use permit and approved site plan and shall be enforced by the Zoning Administrator. 
These conditions may include conditions necessary to ensure that public services and facilities affected by a proposed land use or activity will be capable of accommodating increased service and facility loads caused by the land use or activity to protect the natural environment and conserve natural resources and energy, to ensure compatibility with adjacent uses of land, and to promote the use of land in a socially and economically desirable manner. 
6.  Approval, Granting of Permit. Upon holding a public hearing and the finding that the requirements of Subsections 13.16.2 through 13.16.5 [216.1316 2. through 216.1316 5.] of this Ordinance have been satisfactorily met by the applicant, the Planning Commission shall within 30 days approve, disapprove, or approve with conditions the special land use permit. 
Approval and issuance of a special land use permit by the Planning Commission shall signify prior approval of the application and site plan, therefore including any modifications and any conditions imposed where necessary to comply with this Ordinance. The site plan, as approved, and any statements of conditions and modifications shall become part of the special land use permit and shall be enforceable as such. 
The decision to approve or deny a request for a special land use permit shall be retained as a part of the record of action on the request and shall incorporate a statement of conclusions which specify: the basis for the decision, any changes to the originally submitted application and site plan necessary to ensure compliance with the ordinance, and any conditions imposed with approval. Once a special land use permit is issued, all site development and use of land on the property affected shall be consistent with the approved special land use permit, unless a change conforming to Ordinance requirements receives the mutual agreement of the landowner and the Planning Commission and is documented as such. 
When the Planning Commission gives final approval, a special land use permit shall be issued to the applicant. The Planning Commission shall forward a copy of the permit to the applicant, Clerk, Zoning Administrator, and the Village Council. The Zoning Administrator shall not issue a zoning compliance permit until he or she has received a copy of the special land use permit approved by the Planning Commission. 
7.  Voiding of Special Land Use Permit. Any special land use permit granted under this Ordinance shall become null and void and fees forfeited unless construction and/or use is commenced within 210 days and completed within 575 days of the date of issuance. 
A violation of requirement, condition, or safeguard shall be considered a violation of this Ordinance and grounds for the Planning Commission to terminate and cancel such special land use permit. 
8.  Appeal. Any decision by the Planning Commission granting or denying a special land use permit may be appealed to the Blissfield Village Council. The Appeal may be taken by any person, firm or corporation and must be in writing and filed with the Blissfield Village Clerk within seven days of any decision of the Planning Commission. The Blissfield Village Council shall schedule an appeal hearing within 21 days of receipt of any appeal, with notice as provided in Section 13.16(3) [216.1316(3)].

ARTICLE XIV - OUTDOOR SIGN REGULATIONS 

216.1400 - Intent. 
    Sec. 14.00. The intent of this article is to regulate the location, size, construction, and manner of display of signs and outdoor advertising in order to minimize their harmful effects on the public health, safety and welfare. While these regulations recognize that signs and outdoor advertising are necessary to promote commerce and public information, failure to regulate them may lead to poor identification of individual businesses, deterioration and blight of the business and residential areas of the Village, conflicts between different types of land use, and reduction in traffic safety to pedestrians and motorists. 
To achieve its intended purpose, this article has the following objectives: 
1.  To prevent the placement of signs in a manner that will conceal or obscure other signs or adjacent businesses; 
2.  To keep the number of signs and sign messages at the level reasonably necessary to identify a business and its products or services; 
3.  To keep signs within a reasonable scale with respect to the buildings they identify; 
4.  To reduce visual distraction and obstructions to motorists traveling along, entering or leaving streets; 
5.  To promote a quality manner of display which enhances the character of the Village; 
6.  To prevent the proliferation of temporary signs which might promote visual blight. 
(Amended: 9-28-09)
