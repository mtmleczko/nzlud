an offense or a misdemeanor by this code, or any ordinance or code herein adopted by reference, or omission or failure to perform any act or duty

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=803 24/716
reconsider cannot be made by a member who abstained on the vote which is sought to be reconsidered.

1-6A-7: MOTIONS:
A. Defined: A "motion" is a proposal that the city council take formal action.
B. Classification Of Motions:
1. Main Motions: A "main motion" is one which independently presents an idea for consideration. Only one main motion can be considered at a given
time, and such a motion, when introduced, excludes all other main motions until it has been voted upon or disposed of otherwise.
2. Subsidiary Motions: A "subsidiary motion" is one growing out of and applied to another motion already under consideration. Their existence as
motions depend entirely upon the principal motion to which they are subordinate. Such motions must be voted upon before voting upon the motion to
which they apply.
3. Privileged Motions: A "privileged motion" is one which is so vital in character that it takes precedence over all other motions. Such motions have no
connection with the motion under consideration. A privileged motion sets aside temporarily any business under consideration.
4. Incidental Motions: An "incidental motion" is one growing out of another motion already under consideration. Such a motion must be disposed of
before the main motion or other business under consideration.
C. Progress Of Motions:
1. A council member addresses the presiding officer. The presiding officer should be addressed by title.
2. The council member is recognized by the presiding officer. The presiding officer recognizes the council member by name or by a nod. Having
received formal recognition from the presiding officer, the council member is said to "have the floor" and is the only member entitled to present or
discuss a motion.
3. The council member proposes a motion. A motion is always introduced in the form, "I move that" followed by a statement of the proposal. Aside from
very brief explanatory remarks, it is not permissible to discuss the merits of a motion prior to, or immediately following, the formal proposal of the
motion. All discussion must wait until the presiding officer has stated the motion and has asked for discussion.
4. Another council member seconds the motion. Another council member, without addressing the presiding officer, may say, "I second the motion".
Seconding the motion is merely an indication that the council member seconding it wishes the matter to come to the city council for consideration. If
no one seconds the motion, the presiding officer may ask, "Is there a second to the motion?" If there is none, the presiding officer may declare, "The
motion is lost for want of a second".
5. The presiding officer states the motion to the city council when a motion has been properly proposed and seconded, the presiding officer repeats the
motion to the city council. After the motion has been formally stated to the city council, the motion may be spoken of as "a question", "a proposition",
or "a measure".
6. The city council discusses or debates the motion. After the motion has been formally stated by the presiding officer, any council member has a right
to discuss the issue. Council members must obtain the floor in the same manner as when presenting a motion. Normally the first person who asks
recognition is entitled to speak. All discussion must be confined to the question under consideration.
The presiding officer should always show preference to the proposer of the motion.
A council member who has not spoken before has claim over a council member who has already discussed the question, or who has proposed
another motion.
If the presiding officer knows the opinions of the various council members regarding the measure, the presiding officer should alternate between
those favoring the measures and those in opposition to the measure.
The presiding officer should recognize a council member who seldom speaks in preference of a council member who frequently speaks.
7. The presiding officer takes the vote on the motion. When all council members who desire to discuss the question have done so, the presiding officer
"puts the motion to a vote". Before taking the vote, the presiding officer may inquire, "Is there any further discussion?" or "Are you ready for the
question?" If no council member responds, the presiding officer presumes discussion is closed. The presiding officer will proceed to instruct the city
clerk to take a roll call vote.
8. The presiding officer announces the result of the vote. The presiding officer formally announces the result of the vote, saying, "The motion is carried"
or "The motion is lost". As soon as the vote has been announced, another motion is in order. (2007 Code § 2-36)
1-6A-8: AMENDMENTS TO MOTIONS:
Any amendment to a motion changes a motion by adding to it, taking from it, or by altering it in some other way. The purpose of the motion to amend is to
modify a motion that has already been presented in such a manner that it will be more satisfactory to the council members. An amendment to a motion
may be hostile, but it must be germane. By "germane" it is meant having direct bearing upon the subject matter of the motion; that is, relevant, or relating
to it.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=803 25/716
A. Methods Of Amending Motions:
1. By Addition Or Insertion: To add something to the motion which it did not contain.
2. By Eliminating Or By Striking Out: To subtract or eliminate something from a motion that was originally a part of the motion.
3. By Substitution: This method is a combination of the first two (2) methods, since in amending by substitution something is stricken out and something
inserted in its place. The substitution may consist of a word, a phrase, a clause, or an entirely new motion.
B. Progress Of Amendments:
1. Types Of Amendments:
a. Amendments of the first rank. This is an amendment to the motion.
b. Amendments of the second rank. This is an amendment to the amendment. This type of amendment must modify and relate directly to the
amendment and not to the main motion. Otherwise, it is out of order.
It is not in order to propose more than one amendment of each rank at one time. If a council member wishes to amend two (2) separate and
related parts of a motion, this must be done by two (2) amendments of the second rank, and one must be voted upon before the other is proposed.
It is permissible to have a motion, one amendment to the motion (amendment of the first rank), and one amendment to the amendment
(amendment of the second rank) before the city council at once. Until the amendment of the second rank has been voted upon, no other
amendment of the second rank is in order. Until the amendment of the first rank is voted upon, no other amendment of the first rank can be
proposed.
2. Order Of Voting:
a. Amendments are voted upon in inverse order; that is, the amendment of the second rank is disposed of first.
b. Discussion is held and the vote taken upon the amendment to the amendment.
c. Discussion is held and the vote taken upon the amendment to the motion.
d. When the vote on the amendments have been taken, discussion upon the original or the main motion as amended is held and when completed, a
vote is taken upon the original or main motion as amended. (2007 Code § 2-37)

improvement to machinery and equipment assessed as real estate pursuant to section 427A.1(1)(e) of the code of Iowa, shall be conditioned as
follows:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=803 61/716
1. "New construction", as referred to herein, means new buildings and structures, and includes new buildings and structures which are constructed as
additions to existing buildings and structures. New construction does not include reconstruction of an existing building or structure which does not
constitute complete replacement of an existing building or refitting of an existing building or structure unless the reconstruction of an existing building
or structure is required due to economic obsolescence and the reconstruction is necessary to implement recognized industry standards for the
manufacturing and processing of specific products and the reconstruction is required for the owner of the building or structure to continue to
competitively manufacture or process those products, which determination shall receive prior approval from the city council upon the
recommendation of the Iowa development commission.
2. The exemption shall also apply to new machinery and equipment assessed as real estate pursuant to section 427A.1, subsection 1, paragraph e, of
the code of Iowa, unless the machinery or equipment is part of the normal replacement or operating process to maintain or expand the existing
operational status.
3. "Research service facilities" means a building or group of buildings devoted primarily to research and development activities, including, but not
limited to, the design and production or manufacture of prototype products for experimental use, and corporate research services which do not have
a primary purpose of providing on site services to the public.
4. "Warehouse" means a building or structure used as public warehouse for the storage of goods pursuant to chapter 554, article 7 of the code of Iowa,
except that it does not mean a building or structure used primarily to store raw agricultural products or from which goods are sold at retail.
5. "Distribution center" means a building or structure used primarily for the storage of goods which are intended for subsequent shipment to retail
outlets. Distribution center does not mean a building or structure used primarily to store raw agricultural products, used primarily by a manufacturer to
store goods to be used in the manufacturing process, used primarily for the storage of petroleum products, or used for the retail sale of goods.
6. A property tax exemption under this section shall not be granted if the property for which the exemption is claimed has received any other property
tax exemption authorized by law.
B. Application, Information; Prior Approval Of New Construction Proposals:
1. An application shall be filed for each project resulting in actual value added for which an exemption is claimed. The application for exemption shall be
filed by the owner of the property with the local assessor by February 1 of the assessment year in which the value added is first assessed for
taxation. Applications for exemption shall be made on forms prescribed by the director of revenue of the state of Iowa and shall contain information
pertaining to the nature of the improvement, its cost and other information deemed necessary by the said director.
2. A person may submit a proposal to the city council to receive prior approval for eligibility for a tax exemption on new construction. The city council,
by ordinance, may give its prior approval of a tax exemption for new construction if the new construction is in conformance with the zoning plans for
the city. The prior approval ordinance shall not be enacted until not less than thirty (30) days after a public hearing held in accordance with section
362.3 of the code of Iowa. Prior approval does not entitle the owner to exemption from taxation until the new construction has been completed and
found to be qualified real estate. However, if the tax exemption for new construction is not approved, the person may submit an amended proposal to
the city council to approve or reject.
C. Amount Of Exemption:
1. The actual value added to industrial real estate for the reasons specified in this section is eligible to receive a partial exemption from taxation for a
period of five (5) years. However, if property ceases to be classified as industrial real estate or ceases to be used as a research service facility or a
warehouse or distribution center, the partial exemption for the value added shall not be allowed for subsequent assessment years. "Actual value
added", as used in this section, means the actual value added as of the first of the year for which the exemption is received, except that "actual value
added by improvements to machinery and equipment" means the actual value as determined by the assessor as of January 1 of each year for which
the exemption is received. The amount of actual value added which is eligible to be exempt from taxation shall be as follows:
For the first year 75 percent
For the second year 60 percent
For the third year 45 percent
For the fourth year 30 percent
For the fifth year 15 percent
2. However, the granting of the exemption under this section for new construction constituting complete replacement of an existing building or structure
shall not result in the assessed value of the industrial real estate being reduced below the assessed value of the industrial real estate before the start
of the new construction added.
D. Duration, Repeal Of Exemption: The partial exemption shall be available until such time as this section is repealed by the city council. When, in the
determination of the city council, continuation of the exemption granted in this section ceases to be of benefit to the city, the city council may repeal this
section, but all existing exemptions shall continue until their expiration. (Ord. 55-08, 9-2-2008)

Kennedale, No. 4:05-CV-166-A, Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (N.D. Tex. May 26, 2005);
and based upon reports concerning secondary effects occurring in and around adult entertainment establishments, including, but not limited to, Austin,
Texas - 1986; Indianapolis, Indiana - 1984; Garden Grove, California - 1991; Houston, Texas - 1983, 1997; Phoenix, Arizona - 1979, 1995-98;

Greensboro, North Carolina - 2003; Amarillo, Texas - 1977; Jackson County, Missouri - 2008; New York, New York Times Square - 1994; and the
Report of the Attorney General's working group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota),
the city council finds:
1. Adult entertainment establishments, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including,
but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and
drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, traffic, noise, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation.
2. Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or
abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the city's rationale for this chapter, exists independent of any
comparative analysis between adult and nonadult businesses. Additionally, the city's interest in regulating adult entertainment establishments
extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future adult entertainment establishments that may locate in the city. The city finds
that the cases and documentation relied on in this chapter are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.
The city hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings concerning the secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments and the
legislative record documents supporting same. (Ord. 69-08, 10-20-2008)

ARTICLE A. DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION
8-3A-1: EMPLOYMENT PROHIBITED PRACTICES:
A. General Rule: No person shall discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring,
advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.
B. Construction: As used in subsection A of this section, the term "discriminate against an individual on the basis of disability" includes:
1. Limiting, segregating, or classifying a job applicant or employee in a way that adversely affects the opportunities or status of such applicant or
employee because of the disability of such applicant or employee.
2. Participating in a contractual or other arrangement or relationship that has the effect of subjecting a covered entity's qualified applicant or employee
with a disability to the discrimination prohibited by this title. Such relationship includes a relationship with an employment or referral agency, labor
union, an organization providing fringe benefits to an employee of the covered entity, or an organization providing training and apprenticeship
programs.
3. Utilizing standards, criteria, or methods of administration:
a. That have the effect of discrimination on the basis of disability.
b. That perpetuate the discrimination of others who are subject to common administrative control.
4. Excluding or otherwise denying equal jobs or benefits to a qualified individual because of the known disability of an individual with whom the qualified
individual is known to have a relationship or association.
5. Not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a disability who is an
applicant or employee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of
the business of such covered entity, or denying employment opportunities to a job applicant or employee who is an otherwise qualified individual with
a disability, if such denial is based on the need of such covered entity to make reasonable accommodation to the physical or mental impairments of
the employee or applicant.
6. Using qualification standards, employment tests, or other selection criteria that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a disability or a
class of individuals with disabilities unless the standard test or other selection criteria, as used by the covered entity, is shown to be job related for
the position in question and is consistent with business necessity.
7. Failing to select and administer tests concerning employment in the most effective manner to ensure that when such test is administered to a job
applicant or employee who has a disability that impairs sensory, manual, or speaking skills, such test results accurately reflect the skills, aptitude, or
whatever other factor of such applicant or employee that such test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the impaired sensory, manual, or
speaking skills of such employee or applicant, except where such skills are the factors that the test purports to measure.
8. Soliciting or requiring as a condition of employment of any employee or prospective employee a test for the presence of the antibody to the human
immunodeficiency virus or affecting the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment or terminating the employment of any employee solely as a
result of the employee obtaining a test for the presence of the antibody to the human immunodeficiency virus. An agreement between an employer,
employment agency, labor organization, or their employees, agents, or members and an employee or prospective employee concerning
employment, pay, or benefits to an employee or prospective employee in return for taking a test for the presence of the antibody to the human
immunodeficiency virus is prohibited. The prohibitions of this subsection do not apply if the state epidemiologist determines and the state director of

b. Information obtained regarding the medical condition or history of the applicant is collected and maintained on separate forms and in separate
medical files and is treated as a confidential medical record, except that:
(1) Supervisors and managers may be informed regarding necessary restrictions on the work or duties of the employee and necessary
accommodations.
(2) First aid and safety personnel may be informed, when appropriate, if the disability might require emergency treatment.

to the respondent with an opportunity to be heard, determines that the respondent has engaged in a discriminatory or unfair practice and that the
practice was authorized, requested, commanded, performed, or knowingly or recklessly tolerated by the board of directors of the respondent or by
an officer or executive agent acting within the scope of such officer's or executive agent's employment, the commission shall so certify to the
licensing agency. Unless the commission finding of a discriminatory or unfair practice is reversed in the course of judicial review, the finding of
discrimination is binding on the licensing agency.
b. In the case of a respondent who is found by the commission to have engaged in a discriminatory or unfair practice in the course of performing
under a contract or subcontract with the state or political subdivision or agency, if the practice was authorized, requested, commanded, performed,

and the respondent.

or unfair practices of the type stated in the agreement, to take remedial action as in the judgment of the commission will carry out the purposes of
this code, and to consent to the entry in an appropriate district court of a consent decree embodying the terms of the conciliation agreement.
Violation of such a consent decree may be punished by contempt by the court in which it is filed upon a showing by the commission of the violation at
any time within six (6) months of its occurrence. In all cases where a conciliation agreement is entered into, the commission shall issue an order
stating its terms and furnish a copy of the order to the complainant, the respondent, and such other persons as the commission deems proper.

complaint with the commission in accordance with section 8-4-1 of this chapter. A complainant, after the proper filing of a complaint with the

8-4-8: PROVISIONAL REMEDIES:
If, any time after the filing of a complaint, it shall appear to the commission that there is reason to believe that the party charged has violated this chapter
and there is reason to believe that the person charged is about to commit acts which would make impossible compliance with an order of the commission
to alleviate the grievance, or it appears that a complainant may suffer irreparable injury as a result of alleged violation, the commission's attorney may seek
a temporary injunction restraining the party charged from doing these acts pending completion of the proceedings under this chapter. A temporary
injunction may be issued only after the respondent has been notified and afforded the opportunity to be heard, except that an ex parte temporary injunction
may be issued when the complainant alleges housing discrimination. (Ord. 18-09, 4-6-2009)

enforcement proceeding under subsection B of this section may be brought. For purposes of the time limit for filing a petition for judicial review under
the Iowa administrative procedure act, the issuance of a final decision of the commission under this chapter occurs on the date notice of the decision is
mailed by regular mail to the parties. Notwithstanding the time limit provided in section 17A.19, subsection 3 of the code of Iowa, a petition for judicial
review of no probable cause decisions and other final agency actions which are not of general applicability must be filed within thirty (30) days of the
issuance of the final agency action.
B. Order For Enforcement: The commission may obtain an order for the enforcement of commission orders in a proceeding as provided in this section.
Such an enforcement proceeding shall be brought in the district court of the district in the county in which the alleged discriminatory or unfair practice
which is the subject of the commission's order was committed, or in which any respondent required in the order to cease or desist from a discriminatory
or unfair practice or take other affirmative action, resides or transacts business.
C. Transcript Of Record Of Hearing Filed With Court: Such an enforcement proceeding shall be initiated by the filing of a petition in such court and the
service of a copy thereof upon the respondent. Thereupon, the commission shall file with the court a transcript of the record of the hearing before it.
The court shall have power to grant such temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper, and to make and enter upon the pleadings,
testimony, and proceedings set forth in such transcript an order enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside the order of the
commission, in whole or in part.
D. Consideration Of Objection: An objection that has not been urged before the commission shall not be considered by the court in an enforcement
proceeding unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances.
E. Remission Of Case To Commission: Any party to the enforcement proceeding may move the court to remit the case to the commission in the interests
of justice for the purposes of adducing additional specified and material evidence and seeking findings thereof, provided such party shall show
reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence before the commission.
F. Determination Under State Statute: In the enforcement proceeding, the court shall determine its order on the same basis as it would in a proceeding
reviewing commission action under section 17A.19 of the code of Iowa.

and for the purpose of judicial review of the commission's orders.

I. Expeditious Hearing On Petitions: Petitions filed under this section shall be heard expeditiously and determined upon the transcript filed without
requirement for hearing.
J. Failure To Obtain Judicial Review: If no proceeding to obtain judicial review is instituted within thirty (30) days from the service of an order of the
commission under section 8-4-6 of this chapter, the commission may obtain an order of the court for the enforcement of such order upon showing that
respondent is subject to the jurisdiction of the commission and resides or transacts business within the county in which the petition for enforcement is
brought. (Ord. 18-09, 4-6-2009)

before entering the crosswalk or before entering the intersection.
B. Official traffic-control signals consisting of colored lights or colored lighted arrows shall regulate vehicle and pedestrian traffic in the following manner:
1. A "steady circular red" or "steady red arrow" light means vehicular traffic shall stop. Vehicular traffic shall remain standing until a signal to proceed is
shown or vehicular traffic, unless prohibited by a sign, may cautiously enter the intersection to make a right turn from the right lane of traffic or a left
turn from a one-way street to a one-way street from the left lane of traffic on a one-way street onto the leftmost lane of traffic on a one-way street.
Turns made under this paragraph shall be made in a manner that does not interfere with other vehicular or pedestrian traffic lawfully using the
intersection. Pedestrian traffic facing a steady circular red light shall not enter the roadway unless the pedestrian can safely cross the roadway
without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
2. A "steady circular yellow" or "steady yellow arrow" light means vehicular traffic is warned that the related green movement is being terminated and
vehicular traffic shall no longer proceed into the intersection and shall stop. If the stop cannot be made in safety, a vehicle may be driven cautiously
through the intersection. Pedestrian traffic is warned that there is insufficient time to cross the intersection and any pedestrian starting to cross the
roadway shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles.
3. A "steady circular green" light means vehicular traffic may proceed straight, turn right or turn left through the intersection unless otherwise
specifically prohibited. Vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicular and pedestrian traffic lawfully within the intersection.

and proceed in the direction indicated by the arrow. Vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and pedestrians lawfully within the
intersection.
5. A "flashing circular red" light means vehicular traffic shall stop and after stopping may proceed cautiously through the intersection yielding to all
vehicles not required to stop or yield which are within the intersection or approaching so closely as to constitute a hazard, but then may proceed.
6. A "flashing yellow" light means vehicular traffic shall proceed through the intersection or past such signal with caution.
7. A "flashing yellow arrow" light shown alone or with another official traffic-control signal means vehicular traffic may cautiously enter the intersection
and proceed only in the direction indicated by the arrow. Vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and pedestrians lawfully within
the intersection and any vehicle on the opposing approach which is approaching so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time the
driver is moving within the intersection.
8. A "don't walk" or "steady upraised hand" light is a pedestrian signal which means that pedestrian traffic facing the illuminated pedestrian signal shall
not start to cross the roadway in the direction of the pedestrian signal, and pedestrian traffic in the crossing shall proceed to a safety zone.
9. A "flashing upraised hand" or "upraised hand with countdown" light is a pedestrian signal which means that pedestrian traffic facing the illuminated
pedestrian signal shall not start to cross the roadway in the direction of the pedestrian signal, and pedestrian traffic in the crossing shall proceed to a
safety zone. The "upraised hand with countdown" light is a pedestrian signal that also provides the time remaining for the pedestrian to complete the
crossing.
10. A "walk" or "walking person" light is a pedestrian signal which means that pedestrian traffic facing the illuminated pedestrian signal may proceed to
cross the roadway in the direction of the pedestrian signal and shall be given the right-of-way by drivers of all vehicles. (Ord. 36-17, 7-17-2017)

imitation of or resembles an official parking sign, curb, or other marking, traffic control device, or railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the

such sign, signal, marking, or device has not been authorized by the department and city with reference to streets and highways under their jurisdiction,
and no person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority permit upon any street or highway any traffic sign or signal bearing thereon any
commercial advertising. This shall not be deemed to prohibit the erection upon private property adjacent to highways of signs giving useful directional
information of a type that cannot be mistaken for official signs.
B. Every such prohibited sign, signal, or marking is hereby declared to be a public nuisance and the authority having jurisdiction over the street or highway
is hereby empowered to remove the same or cause it to be removed without notice. (Ord. 44-08, 6-16-2008)

of the bus must bring the bus to a stop, turn off the amber flashing warning lamps, turn on the red flashing warning lamps, and extend the stop arm.
After receiving or discharging pupils, the bus driver must turn off all flashing warning lamps, retract the stop arm and proceed on the route. Except to
the extent that reduced visibility is caused by fog, snow, or other weather conditions, a school bus will not stop to receive or discharge pupils unless
there is at least three hundred feet (300') of unobstructed vision in each direction. However, the driver of a school bus is not required to use flashing
warning lamps and the stop arm when receiving or discharging pupils at a designated loading and unloading zone at a school attendance center or at
extracurricular or educational activity locations where students exiting the bus do not have to cross the street or highway.
If a school district contracts with an urban transit system to transport children to and from a public or private school, the school bus which is provided by
the urban transit system is not required to be equipped with flashing warning lights and a stop arm.
If the school bus provided by an urban transit system is equipped with flashing warning lights and a stop arm, the driver of the school bus must use the
flashing warning lights and stop arm as required by law.
A school bus, when operating on a highway with four (4) or more lanes, will not stop to load or unload pupils who must cross the highway, except at
designated stops where pupils who must cross the highway may do so at points where there are official traffic control devices or police officers.
A school bus must, while carrying passengers, have its headlights turned on.
B. Entrance/Exit For Pupils: All pupils will be received and discharged from the right front entrance of every school bus and if said pupils must cross the
highway, they are required to pass in front of the bus, look in both directions, and proceed to cross the highway only on signal from the bus driver.
C. Driver Responsibilities: The driver of any vehicle, including the driver of a vehicle operating on a private road or driveway, when meeting a school bus
with flashing amber warning lamps must reduce the vehicle's speed to not more than twenty (20) miles per hour and must bring the vehicle to a
complete stop when the school bus stops and the stop signal arm is extended and the vehicle must remain stopped until the stop signal arm is
retracted after which time the driver may proceed with due caution. The driver of a vehicle, including the driver of a vehicle operating on a private road
or driveway, overtaking a school bus will not pass a school bus when red or amber warning signal lights are flashing and must bring the vehicle to a
complete stop no closer than fifteen feet (15') from the school bus when it is stopped and the stop arm is extended and the vehicle must remain
stopped until the stop arm is retracted and school bus resumes motion.
D. Bus Traveling Two Lane Highway: The driver of a vehicle upon a highway providing two (2) or more lanes in each direction need not stop upon meeting
a school bus which is traveling in the opposite direction even though the school bus is stopped.

9-11-321.372A: PROMPT INVESTIGATION OF REPORTED VIOLATION OF FAILING TO OBEY SCHOOL BUS WARNING
DEVICES - CITATION ISSUED TO DRIVER OR OWNER:
A. The driver of a school bus who observes a violation of subsection 9-11-321.372C of this chapter, may prepare a written report on a form provided by the
department of public safety indicating that a violation has occurred. The school bus driver or a school official may deliver the report not more than
seventy two (72) hours after the violation occurred to a peace officer of the state or a peace officer of the county or municipality in which the violation
occurred. The report must state the time and the location at which the violation occurred and must include the registration plate number and a
description of the vehicle involved in the violation.
B. Not more than seven (7) calendar days after receiving a report of a violation of subsection 9-11-321.372C of this chapter, from a school bus driver or a
school official, the peace officer must initiate an investigation of the reported violation and contact the owner of the motor vehicle involved in the
reported violation and request that the owner supply information identifying the driver.
1. If, from the investigation, the peace officer is able to identify the driver and has reasonable cause to believe a violation of subsection 9-11-321.372C
of this chapter, has occurred, the peace officer shall prepare a uniform traffic citation for the violation and shall serve it personally or by certified mail
to the driver of the vehicle.
2. If, from the investigation, the peace officer has reasonable cause to believe that a violation of subsection 9-11-321.372C of this chapter, occurred but
is unable to identify the driver, the peace officer shall serve a uniform traffic citation for the violation to the owner of the motor vehicle. In a proceeding
where the peace officer who conducted the investigation was not able to identify the driver of the motor vehicle, proof that the motor vehicle
described in the uniform traffic citation was used to commit the violation of subsection 9-11-321.372C of this chapter, together with proof that the
defendant named in the citation was the owner of the motor vehicle at the time the violation occurred, constitutes a permissible inference that the
owner was the driver who committed the violation.
3. For purposes of this subsection, "owner" means a person who holds the legal title to a motor vehicle; however, if the motor vehicle is the subject of a
security agreement with a right of possession in the debtor, the debtor shall be deemed the owner for purposes of this subsection, or if the motor
vehicle is leased, the lessee shall be deemed the owner for purposes of this subsection. (Ord. 27-15, 4-20-2015)

BLOCK FACE: All the properties on one (1) side of a given street existing between two (2) consecutive intersecting streets.
DWELLING UNIT: A building or portion of a building which is exclusively arranged, occupied, or intended to be occupied as living quarters for one (1)
family, but not including dwelling units in hotels, rooming houses, institutions, dormitories, or convalescent or nursing homes.
MOTOR VEHICLE: A vehicle licensed as a private passenger car or a motorcycle or light pickup truck but not including any other truck or road tractor.
PEAK PERIOD: That time interval between the hours of seven o'clock (7:00) A.M. and five thirty o'clock (5:30) P.M. daily or between such hours as
requested by the petitioners during which the highest percentage of overall resident and nonresident parking utilization occurs.
RESIDENT: A person who maintains a bona fide occupancy within a residential parking permit district.
RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT: A contiguous area containing public streets or parts thereof abutted by residential property, or residential and nonbusiness
property including, but not limited to, schools, parks, churches, hospitals, and nursing homes.

9-14-321.722: RESIDENTIAL PARKING PERMIT PROGRAM ESTABLISHED:
There is hereby established a Residential Parking Permit Program. The procedure for being designated a residential parking permit district shall be as
follows:
A. Petition:
1. Required: In order to be considered for a residential parking permit district designation, a group of residents must submit a petition to the City
Manager containing the signature of an adult member of at least sixty percent (60%) of the dwelling units in the residential area. Petitions shall only
be considered for areas which contain at least four (4) adjacent block faces or fifty (50) curb parking spaces. The boundaries of and the streets within
the proposed permit parking district shall be clearly identified on each page of the petition. The petition shall also state clearly that, if the district is
approved that participation in the program is mandatory, only those vehicles with a permit shall be permitted to park in the residential parking permit
district between seven o'clock (7:00) A.M. and five thirty o'clock (5:30) P.M. daily, or such other hours as may be requested by the petition and
approved by the City Council, except Sundays and holidays, and an annual fee will be charged for a parking permit for each vehicle. The necessary
petition can be obtained from the Office of the City Clerk. A cover letter explaining the reasons for the request and a map showing the boundaries of
the proposed parking permit district shall accompany the petition.
2. Exception: A petition may be considered for an area which contains less than four (4) adjacent block faces or fifty (50) curb parking spaces if there
are extenuating conditions that render such requirement unreasonable. Upon the recommendation of the City Manager, such requirement may be
waived by the City Council if it finds that the proposed residential district is isolated or separated from other residential areas by topographical
features or by commercial area. The City Council shall not grant such a waiver, however, if it determines that the only basis for granting such a
waiver is the convenience of the residents or if it determines that the waiver is being requested by the petitioners to prevent opposition to establishing
a district. All other requirements of this division must be established.
B. Parking Study: Upon receipt of a valid petition, the City Manager shall cause a parking study of the area identified in the petition to be conducted. A
residential parking permit district may be established only if the results of the study demonstrate that both of the following criterions are satisfied during
peak periods:
1. At least seventy percent (70%) of the curbside parking spaces in the proposed parking permit district were utilized during peak periods. For purposes
of this criterion, a legal curbside parking space shall be twenty three (23) linear feet; and
2. At least twenty five percent (25%) of the curbside parking spaces in the proposed parking district were utilized by nonresident parkers. For purposes
of this criterion, the latest available motor vehicle registration information shall be used.
C. Parking Study Report And Recommendation: Upon completion of the parking study, if the conditions of subsection B of this section are established, the
City Manager shall make a report and recommendation to the City Council, based upon the petition and results of the survey, on whether or not to
designate the proposed parking district or a portion thereof as a residential parking permit district and the hours such restrictions are to be in effect. The
recommendation shall take the following into account:
1. The effect on the safety of the residents of the proposed residential parking permit district from intensive parking by nonresidents;
2. The difficulty or inability of residents of the proposed residential parking permit district to obtain adequate curbside parking adjacent to or near their
residences because of widespread use of available curbside parking spaces by nonresident motorists;
3. The likelihood of alleviating, by use of the Residential Parking Permit Program, any problem of nonavailability of residential parking spaces; and
4. The desire of the residents in the proposed residential parking permit area for the institution of a residential parking permit district and the willingness
of those residents to bear the cost incidental to the administration of the Residential Parking Permit Program.
D. Public Hearing: Upon receipt of the report and recommendation from the City Manager, the City Council shall set a public hearing on the petition. Upon
completion of the public hearing, the City Council may reject the petition or adopt an ordinance designating the permit area as a residential parking
permit district and the hours such parking restrictions are to be in effect.

constructed or existing aerial plant to be maintained.
F. If at any time the city determines that existing wires, cables or other like facilities of public utilities anywhere in the city shall be changed from an
overhead to underground installation, the owner or operator of a facility shall, at the owner's or operator's sole expense, convert its system in that
location to an underground installation.
G. A grantee shall use, with the owner's permission, existing poles, conduits and other facilities whenever feasible. A grantee may not erect poles,

shall be filed with the city upon city request.

promptly relocate any facility located on or within the public rights of way as the city may deem necessary or appropriate to facilitate the realignment,
reconstruction, improvement or repair of public streets, sidewalks, curbs, drains, sewers, and public improvements of any sort; provided, however, that
an operator may be permitted to abandon any property in place with the written consent of the city.

authorized to use the public rights of way, an owner or operator of a facility shall, upon thirty (30) days' advance written notice, take action to effect the
necessary changes requested by the responsible entity. The city may resolve disputes as to responsibility for costs associated with the removal,
relaying, or relocation of facilities as among entities authorized to install facilities in the public rights of way, if the parties are unable to do so
themselves, and if the matter is not governed by a valid contract between the parties or a state or federal law or regulation.
C. In the event of an emergency, or where a facility creates or is contributing to an imminent danger to health, safety, or property, the city may remove,
relay, or relocate any or all parts of that communications system without prior notice. (Ord. 29-05, 5-2-2005)

opportunity to cure, may cause such work to be done, and the owner or operator of a facility shall reimburse the city the cost thereof within thirty (30)
days after receipt of an itemized list of such costs; or the city may recover such costs through the security fund provided by an owner or operator of a
facility, pursuant to the procedures for recovery from the security fund specified in the owner's or operator's franchise agreement.

records, codes, programs, and disks or other storage media and other like material reasonably appropriate in order to monitor compliance with the
terms of this chapter or applicable law, where the owner or operator shall have the burden of showing that such materials are not reasonably
appropriate. This includes not only the books and records directly relevant to enforcement of this chapter or the owner's or operator's franchise
agreement that are held by the operator, but any books and records held by an affiliate, or any contractor, subcontractor or any person holding any
form of management contract for the facilities in the public rights of way to the extent such books or records relate to the facilities. An owner or
operator is responsible for collecting the information and producing it at a location as specified above. The city shall provide the owner or operator
with advance notice stating the types of records sought to be reviewed and the reason for such review.
2. Access to an owner's or operator's records shall not be denied on the basis that said records contain "proprietary" information. Any confidential
information received by the city shall remain confidential insofar as permitted by the Iowa open records act, Iowa Code chapter 22, and other
applicable state and federal law.

partnership interests are identified.
2. Detailed, updated maps depicting the location of all facilities located in public rights of way in the city.

1. An owner or operator shall submit monthly construction reports to the city for any major construction undertaken in the public rights of way until such
construction is complete. The owner or operator must submit updated as built system design maps to the city, or make them available for inspection,
with notice of their availability, within thirty (30) days of the completion of system construction in any geographic area. These maps shall be
developed on the basis of postconstruction inspection by the owner or operator and construction personnel. Any departures from design must be
indicated on the as built maps.

E. Voluminous Materials: If any books, records, maps or plans, or other requested documents are too voluminous, or for security reasons cannot be copied
and moved, then an owner or operator of facilities in the public rights of way may request that the inspection take place at some other location;
provided, that: 1) the owner or operator must make necessary arrangements for copying documents selected by the city after review; and 2) the owner
or operator must pay all travel and additional copying expenses incurred by the city in inspecting those documents or having those documents
inspected by its designee, as charges incidental to the enforcing of the owner's or operator's franchise or other authorization for use of the public rights
of way. (Ord. 29-05, 5-2-2005)
11-2-19: BOND OR LETTER OF CREDIT:
No person shall install, erect, hang, lay, bury, draw, emplace, construct, reconstruct, maintain, or operate any facility upon, across, beneath, or over any
public right of way in the city or other city property until the owner or operator shall have filed with the city manager a bond and/or letter of credit, in a form
acceptable to the city, running in favor of the city, to guarantee the obligations of the owner or operator under this chapter and applicable law. The amount
of the bond or letter of credit shall be no less than the reasonable cost of removal of the facilities and restoration of any affected public rights of way or
other property pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 29-05, 5-2-2005)
11-2-20: INSURANCE:
An owner or operator shall maintain insurance covering its facilities and operations in the public rights of way, as specified in a specific provision of this

remedy available at law or equity, including, but not limited to, imposition of penalties pursuant to subsection A of this section.
C. Timely Performance Or Compliance: Any failure of the city to insist on timely performance or compliance by any person shall not constitute a waiver of
the city's right to later insist on timely performance or compliance by that person or any other person.
D. Termination On Account Of Certain Assignments Or Appointments:
1. To the extent not prohibited by the United States bankruptcy code, a franchise under this chapter shall terminate automatically by force of law one
hundred twenty (120) calendar days after an assignment for the benefit of creditors or the appointment of a receiver or trustee (including a debtor in
possession in a reorganization) to take over the business of the owner or operator, whether in bankruptcy or under a state law proceeding; provided,
however, that such franchise shall not so terminate if, within that one hundred twenty (120) day period:
a. Such assignment, receivership or trusteeship has been vacated; or
b. Such assignee, receiver, or trustee has cured any defaults and has fully complied with the terms and conditions of this chapter and any applicable
agreement and has executed an agreement, approved by any court having jurisdiction, under which it assumes and agrees to be bound by the
terms and conditions of this chapter and any applicable agreement.
c. In the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of any of the facilities, equipment, or property of an owner or operator of facilities in the public
rights of way, its franchise under this chapter shall automatically terminate thirty (30) calendar days after such foreclosure or sale, unless:

(2) The successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the city to assume and be bound by the terms and conditions binding its predecessor.
d. Any mortgage, pledge or lease of facilities in the public rights of way shall be subject and subordinate to the rights of the city under this chapter

6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=803 277/716
2. If a franchise under this chapter is terminated for any reason, the city may, at its discretion, require the grantee to remove its facilities from the public
rights of way and to restore the public rights of way to their prior condition at the owner's or operator's expense, or that of their sureties. If an owner
or operator whose franchise has been terminated fails, after reasonable notice from the city, to remove its facilities from the public rights of way, such
facilities shall be deemed abandoned and ownership forfeited to the city.
E. Remedies Cumulative: All remedies specified in this chapter are cumulative unless otherwise expressly stated. The exercise of one remedy shall not
foreclose use of another, nor shall the exercise of a remedy or the payment of liquidated damages or penalties relieve an operator of its obligations to
comply with this chapter. In exercising any remedy specified in this chapter, including articles A and B, the city shall comply with any substantive and
procedural requirements for exercising such remedies in an owner's or operator's franchise agreement or other authorization.
F. Time Limit For Paying Penalty: The owner or operator shall pay any penalty assessed in accordance with this section within fourteen (14) days after
receipt of notice from the city of such penalty.

incurred in defending against any such claim, suit, or proceeding. Recovery by the city of any amounts under insurance, the performance bond or letter of
credit, or otherwise shall not limit in any way a person's duty to indemnify the city, nor shall such recovery relieve a person of its obligations pursuant to a
franchise under this chapter limit the amounts owed to the city, or in any respect prevent the city from exercising any other right or remedy it may have.
(Ord. 29-05, 5-2-2005)
11-2-23: SEVERABILITY:
If any term, condition, or provision of this chapter shall, to any extent, be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder hereof shall be valid in all other
respects and continue to be effective. In the event of a subsequent change in applicable law so that the provision which had been held invalid is no longer
invalid, said provision shall thereupon return to full force and effect without further action by the city and shall thereafter be binding on owners and
operators. (Ord. 29-05, 5-2-2005)
ARTICLE A. CABLE COMMUNICATIONS
11-2A-1: TITLE:
This article shall be known and may be cited as the CITY CABLE COMMUNICATIONS REGULATORY CODE. (Ord. 29-05, 5-2-2005)
11-2A-2: FURTHER FINDINGS AND PURPOSE:
A. The city finds that the further development of cable communications may result in great benefits for the people of the city. Cable technology is rapidly
changing, and cable plays an essential role as part of the city's basic infrastructure. Cable television systems permanently occupy and extensively
make use of scarce and valuable public rights of way, in a manner different from the way in which the general public uses them, and in a manner
reserved primarily for those who provide essential services to the public subject to special public interest obligations, such as utility companies. The
grant of a franchise has the effect of giving the holder extensive economic benefits and placing the holder in a position of public trust. The city finds that
public convenience, safety, and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers vested in the city or such persons as the city so
designates to protect the public and to ensure that any franchise granted is operated in the public interest.
B. Further, it is recognized that cable systems have the capacity to provide not only entertainment and information services to the city's residents, but can
provide a variety of broadband, interactive communications services to institutions and individuals. Many of these services involve city agencies and
other public institutions. (Ord. 29-05, 5-2-2005)
11-2A-3: GOALS:
In light of the provisions of section 11-2A-2 of this article, the following goals, among others, underlie the provisions set forth in this article:
A. Cable should be available to as many city residents and businesses as possible.
B. A cable system should be capable of accommodating both present and reasonably foreseeable future cable related needs of the city.
C. A cable system should be constructed and maintained during a franchise term so that changes in technology may be integrated to the maximum extent
commercially practicable into existing system facilities.
D. A cable system should be responsive to the needs and interests of the local community, and shall provide the widest possible diversity of information
sources and service to the public.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=803 278/716
E. A cable operator should pay fair compensation to the city for the occupation and use of scarce and valuable local public rights of way. (Ord. 29-05, 5-2-
2005)
11-2A-4: INTENT:
The city intends that all provisions set forth in this article be construed to serve the public interest and the foregoing public purposes, and that any
franchise issued pursuant to this article be construed to include the foregoing findings and public purposes as integral parts thereof. (Ord. 29-05, 5-2-2005)
11-2A-5: DELEGATION OF POWERS:
The city may delegate the performance of any act, duty, or obligation, or the exercise of any power, under this article or any franchise agreement to any
employee, officer, department or agency of the city, except where prohibited by applicable law. (Ord. 29-05, 5-2-2005)

SUBSCRIBER: The city or any person who is lawfully receiving, for any purpose or reason, any cable service via a cable system, whether or not a fee is

franchise are transferred, directly or indirectly, to another party; or c) any change or substitution occurs in the managing general partners of the grantee,
where applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, transfers or changes of control between affiliates under common ownership or control shall not constitute
a "transfer"; provided, that the ultimate parent of the grantee executes and delivers a guarantee of the grantee's performance under this article and its
franchise agreement in substantially the form attached to the ordinance codified herein.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, pledges in trust or mortgages of the assets of a cable system to secure the construction, operation, or
repair of the system may be made without application and without city's prior consent. However, no such arrangement shall be made if it would in any
respect under any condition: a) prevent the grantee or any successor from complying with this article, franchise agreement or other applicable law or
regulation; or b) permit a third party to succeed to the interest of the operator, or to own or control the system, without the prior consent of city. Any
mortgage, pledge or lease shall be subject to and subordinate to the rights of city under any franchise, this title, or other applicable law.
A. "Control" for purposes of this definition means the legal or practical ability to exert actual working control over the affairs of an entity, either directly or
indirectly, whether by contractual agreement, majority ownership interest, any lesser ownership interest, or in any other manner.
B. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or accumulation of five percent (5%) or more of the
ownership (as measured by voting interests, not number of shares) of an entity by any person or group of persons acting in concert, none of whom
already own or control fifty percent (50%) or more of such right or control, singularly or collectively.
C. A grantee is responsible for ensuring that the intent of section 11-2A-18 of this article is carried out. If for any reason an event occurs that would
require the city's approval under section 11-2A-18 of this article, whether or not such event is directly or indirectly within the grantee's control, such
event shall constitute a "transfer" for purposes of this article and any applicable law.
USER: A person or organization using a channel or equipment and facilities for purposes of producing or transmitting material, as contrasted with the
receipt thereof in the capacity of a subscriber. (Ord. 29-05, 5-2-2005)
11-2A-7: GRANT OF FRANCHISE:
A. Grant:
1. The city may grant one or more cable franchises, and each such franchise shall be awarded in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this
article.
2. This article may be amended from time to time, and in no event shall this article be considered a contract between the city and a grantee such that
the city would be prohibited from amending any provision hereof.
3. No person may construct or operate a cable system in the city without a franchise granted by the city. No person may be granted a franchise without
having entered into a franchise agreement with the city pursuant to this article.
B. Term Of Franchise: No franchise shall be granted for a period of more than fifteen (15) years, except that a grantee may apply for renewal or extension
pursuant to applicable law.
C. Franchise Characteristics:
1. A franchise authorizes use of public rights of way for installing cables, wires, lines, optical fiber, underground conduit, and other devices necessary
and appurtenant to the operation of a cable system to provide cable service within a franchise area, but does not expressly or implicitly authorize a
grantee to provide service to, or install a cable system on, private property without owner consent (except for use of compatible easements pursuant
to section 621 of the cable act, 47 USC section 541(a)(2)), or to use publicly or privately owned conduits without a separate agreement with the
owners.
2. A franchise shall constitute both a right and an obligation to provide the cable services regulated by the provisions of this article and the franchise
agreement.
3. A franchise is nonexclusive and will not explicitly or implicitly preclude the issuance of other franchises to operate cable systems within the city;
affect the city's right to authorize use of public rights of way by other persons to operate cable systems or for other purposes as it determines
appropriate; or affect the city's right to itself construct, operate, or maintain a cable system, with or without a franchise, subject to applicable state and
federal law.
4. All privileges prescribed by a franchise shall be subordinate to (without limitation) the city's use of the public rights of way for purposes that do not
directly or indirectly compete with the grantee and to any prior lawful occupancy of the public rights of way.
5. No reference herein, or in any franchise agreement, to "public rights of way" shall be deemed to be a representation or guarantee by the city that its
interest or other right to control the use of such property is sufficient to permit its use for such purposes, and a grantee shall be deemed to gain only
those rights to use as are properly in the city and as the city may have the undisputed right and power to give.
D. Grantee Subject To Other Laws, Police Power:
1. A grantee shall at all times be subject to and shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws. A grantee shall at all times be subject to

applications shall include the names and addresses of persons authorized to act on behalf of all applicants with respect to the application.
c. All applications accepted for filing shall be made available by the city for public inspection.
2. Application For Grant Of An Initial Franchise:
a. A person may apply for an initial franchise by submitting an application containing the information required in subsection F3 of this section. Upon
receipt of such an application, the city may either: 1) evaluate the application pursuant to subsection F2c of this section, conducting such
investigations as it deems necessary; or 2) issue a request for proposal (RFP), after conducting, if necessary, a proceeding to identify the future
cable related needs and interests of the community. Any such RFP shall be mailed to the person requesting its issuance and made available to
any other interested party. The RFP may contain a proposed franchise agreement.
b. An applicant shall respond to an RFP by filing an application within the time directed by the city, delivering a copy to each existing grantee and
providing the information and material set forth in subsection F3 of this section. The procedures, instructions, and requirements set forth in the
RFP shall be followed by each applicant. Any applicant that has already filed materials pursuant to subsection F2a of this section need not refile
the same materials with its RFP response, but must amplify its application to include any additional or different materials required by the RFP. The
city or its designee may seek additional information from any applicant and establish deadlines for the submission of such information.
c. In evaluating an application for a franchise, the city shall consider, among other things, the following factors:
(1) The extent to which the applicant has substantially complied with the applicable law and the material terms of any existing cable franchise for
the city;
(2) Whether the quality of the applicant's service under any existing franchise in the city, including signal quality, response to customer complaints,
billing practices, and the like, has been reasonable in light of the needs and interests of the communities served;
(3) Whether the applicant has the financial, technical, and legal qualifications to provide cable service;
(4) Whether the application satisfies any minimum requirements established by the city and is otherwise reasonable to meet the future cable
related needs and interests of the community, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and interests;
(5) Whether the application satisfies any requirements under applicable state or federal law governing the issuance of additional franchises;
(6) Whether, to the extent not considered under subsection F2c(4) of this section, the applicant will provide adequate public, educational, and
governmental access channel capacity, facilities, or financial support;
(7) Whether issuance of a franchise is warranted in the public interest considering the immediate and future effect on the public rights of way and
private property that would be used by the cable system, including the extent to which installation or maintenance as planned would require
replacement of property or involve disruption of property, public services, or use of the public rights of way; the effect of granting a franchise on
the ability of cable to meet the cable related needs and interests of the community;
(8) What effects a grant of the application may have on competition in the delivery of cable service in the city.
d. If the city finds that it is in the public interest to issue a franchise considering the factors set forth above, and subject to the applicant's entry into an
appropriate franchise agreement, it shall issue a franchise. If the city denies a franchise, it will issue a written decision explaining why the franchise
was denied. Prior to deciding whether or not to issue a franchise, the city may hold one or more public hearings or implement other procedures
under which comments from the public on an application may be received. The city also may grant or deny a request for a franchise based on its
review of an application without further proceedings and may reject any application that is incomplete or fails to respond to an RFP. This article is
not intended and shall not be interpreted to grant any applicant or existing grantee standing to challenge the denial of its application or the
issuance of a franchise to another; however, an existing grantee shall be deemed an interested party for purposes of subsection J of this section.
3. Contents Of Application: An RFP for the grant of an initial franchise shall require, and any such application shall contain, at a minimum, the following
information:

aboveground installation and the actual cost of the underground installation.

twenty four (24) hours after the subscriber reports the problem to the grantee or its representative or the interruption or need for repairs otherwise
becomes known to the grantee. Work on all other requests for service must be begun by the next business day after notification of the problem. All
such work must be completed within three (3) days from the date of the initial request, except installation requests. In any case where, for reasons
beyond a grantee's control, the work could not be completed in the specified time periods even with the exercise of all due diligence, the grantee

service may be required of subscribers by any grantee. So long as the subscriber returns, or permits the grantee to retrieve, any equipment
necessary to receive a service within five (5) business days of the disconnection, no charge may be imposed by any grantee for any cable service
delivered after the date of the disconnect request.
3. Any security deposit and/or other funds due the subscriber shall be refunded on disconnected accounts after any customer premises equipment
provided by the grantee has been recovered by the grantee. The refund must be made within thirty (30) days or by the end of the next billing cycle,
whichever is earlier, from the date disconnection was requested (or, if later, the date on which any customer premises equipment provided by the
grantee is returned).
4. If a subscriber fails to pay a monthly subscriber fee or other fee or charge, a grantee may disconnect the subscriber's service; however, such
disconnection shall not be effected until after forty five (45) days from the beginning of the period for which the service being billed is rendered, plus
at least ten (10) days' advance written notice to the subscriber in question of intent to disconnect, given after the forty five (45) days have elapsed. If
the subscriber pays all amounts due, including late charges, before the date scheduled for disconnection, the grantee shall not disconnect service.
After disconnection, upon payment by the subscriber in full of all proper fees or charges, including the payment of the reconnection charge, if any, the
grantee shall promptly reinstate service.
5. A grantee may immediately disconnect a subscriber if the subscriber is damaging or destroying the grantee's cable system or equipment. After
disconnection, the grantee shall restore service after the subscriber provides adequate assurance that it has ceased the practices that led to
disconnection, and pays all proper fees and charges, including any reconnect fees and amounts owed the grantee for damage to its cable system or
equipment.
6. A grantee may also disconnect a subscriber that causes signal leakage in excess of federal limits. Disconnection may be effected after five (5) days'
written notice to the subscriber, if the subscriber fails to take steps to correct the problem. In addition, a grantee may disconnect a subscriber without
notice where signal leakage is detected originating from the subscriber's premises in excess of federal limits; provided, that the grantee shall
immediately notify the subscriber of the problem and, once the problem is corrected, reconnect the subscriber.
7. If a grantee fails to remove its subscriber terminal equipment from a subscriber's premises within one hundred twenty (120) days of the termination
of service, the property shall be deemed abandoned, unless such subscriber is responsible for the grantee's failure to remove such property.
8. A grantee shall reconnect service to customers wishing restoration of service, provided such a customer shall first satisfy any previous obligations
owed.
K. Parental Control Option: A grantee shall make available to any subscribers upon request the option of blocking the video or audio portion of any
channel or channels of programming entering the subscriber's home. The control option described herein shall be made available to all subscribers
requesting it when any cable service is provided, or reasonably soon thereafter.
L. Subscriber Contracts: No grantee shall require a subscriber, as a condition of service, to waive any rights the subscriber may have against the grantee
at law or equity.

is the correct amount due.
D. Allocation Of Discounts: For purposes of calculating franchise fee payments under applicable franchise provisions, any discount reflected in an

test upon the city's request. In addition, the grantee shall retain written reports of the results of any tests required by the FCC, and such reports shall be

is attributable to bodily injury, sickness, disease or death, or injury to or destruction of property including loss of use resulting therefrom, but only to the
extent caused in whole or in part by negligent acts or omissions of the grantee, the grantee's subcontractor, or anyone directly or indirectly employed
by the grantee or the grantee's subcontractor or anyone for whose acts the grantee or the grantee's subcontractor may be liable, regardless of whether

6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=803 288/716

subscribers gained or lost for each category of service by the city during the city's fiscal year.
2. A summary of complaints, identifying both the number and nature of the complaints received and an explanation of their dispositions, as such
records are kept by the grantee. Where complaints involve recurrent system problems, the nature of each such problem and the corrective measures
taken shall be identified.
3. A report showing the number of service calls received by type during each quarter, and the percentage of service calls compared to the subscriber
base by type of complaint.
4. A report showing the number of outages and service degradations for each quarter, and identifying separately each planned outage, the time it

issued by any state or federal agency instituting any investigation or civil or criminal proceeding regarding the cable system, the grantee, or any affiliate
of the grantee, to the extent the same may affect or bear on operations in the city. By way of illustration and not limitation, a notice that an affiliate that

information which must be provided or may be requested under this article or this agreement, including by providing appropriate subscriber privacy
notices. Nothing in this section shall be read to require a grantee to violate 47 USC section 551. Each grantee shall be responsible for redacting any

having jurisdiction over such a challenge. Records shall be kept for at least five (5) years, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the city.
H. Waiver Of Reporting Requirements: The city may, at its discretion, waive in writing the requirement of any particular report specified in this section.

assessing liquidated damages for customer service standards that are measured on a quarterly basis:

the provisions of this article and/or its franchise agreement.
B. Remedies Cumulative: All remedies under this article and the franchise agreement are cumulative unless otherwise expressly stated. The exercise of a
remedy or the payment of liquidated damages or penalties shall not relieve a grantee of its obligations to comply with its franchise or applicable law.
C. Relation To Insurance And Indemnity Requirements: Recovery by the city of any amounts under insurance, the security fund, the performance bond, or
letter of credit, or otherwise does not limit a grantee's duty to indemnify the city in any way; nor shall such recovery relieve a grantee of its obligations
under a franchise, limit the amounts owed to the city, or in any respect prevent the city from exercising any other right or remedy it may have. (Ord. 29-
05, 5-2-2005)
11-2A-18: TRANSFERS:
A. City Approval Required:
1. A franchise shall be a privilege that is in the public trust and personal to the grantee. A grantee's obligations under its franchise involve personal
services whose performance involves personal credit, trust, and confidence in the grantee.
2. No transfer of a franchise, grantee, or cable system, or of control over the same (including, but not limited to, transfer by forced or voluntary sale,
merger, consolidation, receivership, or any other means) shall occur unless prior application is made by the grantee to the city and the city's prior
written consent is obtained, pursuant to this article and the franchise agreement, and only then upon such terms and conditions as the city deems
necessary and proper. Any such transfer without the prior written consent of the city shall be considered to impair the city's assurance of due
performance. The granting of approval for a transfer in one instance shall not render unnecessary approval of any subsequent transfer.
B. Application:
1. A grantee shall promptly notify the city of any proposed transfer.
2. At least one hundred twenty (120) calendar days prior to the contemplated effective date of a transfer, a grantee shall submit to the city a written
application for approval of a transfer. Such an application shall provide complete information on the proposed transaction, including details on the
legal, financial, technical, and other qualifications of the transferee, and on the potential impact of the transfer on subscriber rates and service. At a
minimum, the following information must be included in the application, unless these requirements are waived, reduced, or modified by the city:
a. All information and forms required under federal law;
b. All information required in subsections 11-2A-7F3a through F3e of this article;
c. A detailed statement of the corporate or other business entity organization of the proposed transferee, together with an explanation of how
decisions regarding the system will be made if the proposed transaction is approved;
d. Complete and unredacted copies of any contracts, financing documents, or other documents that relate to the proposed transaction, and all
documents, schedules, exhibits, or the like referred to therein;
e. Any documents related to the transaction (including any documents regarding rates the transferee expects to charge) that have been provided to
any entity that has been asked to provide financing (debt, equity, or any other kind) for, or to underwrite any offering made in connection with, the
proposed transaction;
f. Any shareholder reports or filings with the securities and exchange commission (SEC) or the federal trade commission (FTC) that discuss the
transaction, and any filings required under federal or state law in connection with the proposed transaction;
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=803 290/716
g. Complete financial statements for the grantee and any potential transferees for the last three (3) years, including balance sheets, income
statements, profit and loss statements, and documents detailing capital investments and operating costs;
h. A detailed description of the sources and amounts of the funds to be used in the proposed transaction, indicating how the debt equity ratio of the
system will change in the course of the transaction; what entities will be liable for repayment of any debt incurred; what interest, payment schedule,
and other terms or conditions will apply to any debt financing; any debt coverages or financial ratios any potential transferees will be required to
maintain over the franchise term if the proposed transaction is approved; what financial resources would be available to the system under the
control of the proposed transferee; whether the proposed transferee can meet debt equity or any other required ratios without increasing rates,
with any assumptions underlying that conclusion, and if not, what increases would be required and why;
i. Any other information necessary to provide a complete and accurate understanding of the financial position of the system before and after the
proposed transfer;
j. Complete information regarding any potential impact of the transfer on subscriber rates and service;
k. Any representations made to anyone, in connection with the transaction, about the grantee's compliance with its franchise; and
l. A brief summary of the proposed transferee's plans for at least the next five (5) years regarding line extension, plant and equipment upgrades,
channel capacity, expansion or elimination of services, and any other changes affecting or enhancing the performance of the system.
3. To the extent consistent with applicable law, the city may waive in writing any such requirement that information be submitted as part of the initial
application, without thereby waiving any rights the city may have to request such information after the initial application is filed.
4. For the purposes of determining whether it shall consent to a transfer, the city or its agents may inquire into all qualifications of the prospective
transferee and such other matters as the city may deem necessary in considering the matters described in subsection C1 of this section. The
grantee and any prospective transferees shall assist the city in any such inquiry, and if they fail to do so, the request for transfer may be denied.
5. Any transfer review period established by federal law will not begin until all documents and information required by subsection B2 of this section,
without exception, have been provided to the city, unless the city and the grantee have expressly agreed in writing, before the transfer application is
filed with the city, that specified documents or parts of documents may be redacted, excluded, or reviewed through special arrangements. It shall be
the responsibility of the grantee in any transfer to make any arrangements with the city with regard to redaction, exclusion, or confidentiality,
including, without limitation, the execution of any confidentiality agreements that may be appropriate, prior to the filing of any FCC form 394 or
transfer application. By accepting its franchise, a grantee agrees that any transfer application inconsistent with this requirement is void and, in
addition, that filing such an application constitutes a violation of this article.
C. Determination By City:
1. In making a determination as to whether to grant, deny, or grant subject to conditions an application for a transfer, the city may consider, without
limitation, the legal, financial, and technical qualifications of the transferee to operate its system; any potential impact of the transfer on subscriber
rates or services; whether the incumbent cable operator is in compliance with its franchise agreement, this article, and applicable law, and, if not,
whether the proposed transferee will cure any noncompliance; whether the transferee owns or controls any other cable system in the city, and
whether operation by the transferee may eliminate or reduce competition in the delivery of cable service in the city; whether operation by the
transferee or approval of the transfer would adversely affect subscribers or the public, or the city's interest under the franchise agreement, this article,
and other applicable law; whether the transfer would make it less likely that the future cable related needs and interests of the community would be
satisfied at a reasonable cost; and any other matters that it is required or permitted to consider under applicable law.
2. Any transfer without the city's prior written approval shall be ineffective, and shall make this franchise subject to cancellation at the city's sole
discretion, and to any other remedies available under the franchise agreement, this article, or other applicable law. Any such transfer shall be
deemed to cause irreparable harm to the city.
3. A grantee shall be fully liable for any transfer that is in violation of the terms of its franchise agreement or this article and is caused in whole or in part
by any other entity or entities, including, but not limited to, any parents or affiliated entities, as if such transfer had been caused by the grantee itself.
D. Transferee's Agreement: No application for a transfer shall be granted unless the transferee agrees in writing that it will abide by and accept all terms of
the franchise agreement and this article, and that it will assume the obligations, liabilities, and responsibility for all acts and omissions, known and
unknown, of the previous grantee for all purposes, including renewal, unless the city, in its sole discretion, expressly waives this requirement in whole
or in part.
E. Approval Does Not Constitute Waiver: Approval by the city of a transfer does not constitute a waiver or release of any of the rights of the city under this
article or a franchise agreement, whether arising before or after the date of the transfer. (Ord. 29-05, 5-2-2005)
11-2A-19: RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS PROTECTED:
A. Discriminatory Practices Prohibited:
1. A grantee shall not deny service, deny access, or otherwise discriminate against subscribers, programmers, or residents of the city on the basis of
race, color, religion, national origin, sex, or age.
2. A grantee shall not discriminate among persons or take any retaliatory action against a person because of that person's exercise of any right it may
have under federal, state, or local law, nor may the grantee require a person to waive such rights as a condition of taking service.
3. A grantee shall not deny access or levy different rates and charges on any group of potential residential cable subscribers because of the income of
the residents of the local area in which such group resides.
4. Subject to applicable law and except to the extent the city may waive such a requirement, a grantee is prohibited from discriminating in its rates or
charges or from granting undue preferences to any subscriber, potential subscriber, or group of subscribers or potential subscribers; provided,
however, that a grantee may offer temporary, bona fide promotional discounts in order to attract or maintain subscribers, so long as such discounts
are offered on a nondiscriminatory basis to similar classes of subscribers throughout the city; and a grantee may offer discounts for the elderly, the
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=803 291/716
disabled, not for profit persons or organizations, or the economically disadvantaged, and such other discounts as it is expressly entitled to provide
under federal law, if such discounts are applied in a uniform and consistent manner. A grantee shall comply at all times with all applicable federal,
state, and city laws, and all executive and administrative orders relating to nondiscrimination.
5. A grantee may impose different financial terms and conditions on different subscribers based on rational classifications (for example, the subscriber's
credit history); provided, that such imposition does not violate applicable state or federal law.
B. Subscriber Privacy:
1. A grantee shall at all times protect the privacy rights of all subscribers, including, but not limited to, those rights secured by the provisions of section
631 of the cable act, 47 USC section 551.
2. A subscriber may at any time revoke any authorization to release information by delivering to the grantee in writing, by mail or otherwise, the
subscriber's decision to revoke the authorization. Any such revocation shall be effective upon receipt by the grantee.
3. A grantee shall not condition subscriber service on the subscriber's grant or denial of permission to collect, maintain or disclose personally
identifiable information except to the extent that such information is necessary for credit check or billing purposes. A subscriber may at any time
revoke any permission previously given by delivering to the grantee a written statement of that intent. (Ord. 29-05, 5-2-2005)
11-2A-20: RECOURSE AGAINST CITY LIMITED:
Without limiting such immunities as the city or other persons may have under applicable law, a grantee shall have no recourse whatsoever against the city
or its officials, boards, commissions, agents or employees for any loss, costs, expense or damage arising out of any provision or requirement of this article
or because of the enforcement of this article or the city's exercise of its authority pursuant to this article, a franchise agreement, or other applicable law,

A. Grant Of Authority: Upon passage by the council of an ordinance granting a franchise to the grantee, the grantee will be granted a franchise subject to
the terms and conditions of this franchise agreement, and subject to the cable ordinance and all other applicable law. This franchise shall grant
authority for the grantee to use the city's public rights of way for the provision of cable service. Other services may be provided pursuant to subsection
11-3A-6H of this article. No privilege or power of eminent domain is bestowed by this grant; nor by this agreement. This agreement does not confer any
rights other than as expressly provided herein. It neither authorizes the grantee to use the public rights of way for purposes of providing any service
other than cable service, nor prohibits the grantee from doing so. The franchise will be for the period specified in subsection C of this section, during
which time the grantee will receive the right and obligation to construct, reconstruct, operate and maintain a cable television system within the public
rights of way in the city for the sole purpose of providing cable service. If for any reason whatsoever the council does not pass such an ordinance, this
franchise agreement will be of no further force and effect.
B. Area Served:
1. The franchise is for the "franchise area", as that term is defined in section 11-3A-1 of this article.
2. The grantee shall offer service to all areas located within the city limits as they existed on the effective date of this agreement. It must extend service
to persons in the city, including residents located in areas which may be annexed in the future, in accordance with the provisions of this agreement,
unless this requirement is waived in writing by the city.
C. Term: The franchise and this franchise agreement shall extend through June 30, 2020, unless the franchise is earlier revoked or its term shortened as
provided herein or in the cable ordinance.
D. Grant Not Exclusive: The franchise and the right it grants to use and occupy the public rights of way shall not be exclusive, and the city reserves the
right to grant other franchises for similar uses or for other uses of the public rights of way, or any portions thereof, to any person, or to make any such
use itself, at any time, with or without a franchise, subject to applicable state law, as such law may be subsequently amended from time to time.
E. Compliance With Applicable Law: The grantee shall comply with the cable ordinance and all other applicable law. The grantee accepts and agrees to all
of the provisions of the cable ordinance, and the obligations imposed upon it thereby, to the same degree and extent as if each and every such
provision were repeated herein, and irrespective of whether any such provisions be so repeated.
F. Franchise Agreement Subject To Exercise Of Police Powers: All rights and privileges granted herein are subject to the police powers of the city and its
rights under applicable laws and regulations to exercise its governmental powers to their full extent and to regulate the grantee and the construction,
operation and maintenance of the grantee's cable system, including, but not limited to, the right to adopt, amend, and enforce ordinances and
regulations as the city shall find necessary in the exercise of its police powers, the right to adopt and enforce applicable zoning, building, permitting and
safety ordinances and regulations, the right to adopt and enforce ordinances and regulations relating to equal employment opportunities, and the right
to adopt and enforce ordinances and regulations containing right of way, telecommunications, utility and cable television consumer protection and
service standards and rate regulation provisions, except to the extent that an exercise of such powers would impair the obligations of this agreement as
prohibited by article I, section 10, clause 1 of the U.S. constitution.
G. Approval And Effective Date: This franchise agreement shall become effective upon publication of the ordinance approving this franchise agreement
(the "effective date").

1. Accepts and agrees to comply with each provision of the cable ordinance and this agreement, and all applicable federal, state, and local laws and
regulations;
2. Acknowledges and accepts the city's legal right to grant the franchise, to enter this franchise agreement, and to enact and enforce ordinances and
regulations related to the franchise;
3. Agrees that the franchise was granted pursuant to processes and procedures consistent with applicable law, and that it will not raise any claim to the
contrary, or allege in any claim or proceeding by the grantee against the city that any provision, condition or term of the franchise, the ordinance or
this franchise agreement at the time of the acceptance of the franchise was unlawful, unreasonable or arbitrary, or that at the time of the acceptance
of the franchise any such provision, condition or term was void or that the city had no power or authority to make or enforce any such provision,
condition or term; and
4. Agrees that it will not oppose intervention by the city in any proceeding affecting the grantee's cable system.
I. Claims Related To Prior Franchise: As of the effective date of the franchise, the prior franchise shall be of no further force and effect, and as of that date,
the grantee surrenders any rights it had thereunder. The grantee shall remain liable for payments of all franchise fees owed under the prior franchise,
and the grant of the franchise shall have no effect on the grantee's duty under the prior franchise to indemnify or insure the city against acts and

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=803 294/716
omissions occurring during the period that the prior franchise was in effect, including losses or damages resulting from any failure to construct, install or
maintain its cable system properly.
J. Waivers:
1. On petition by the grantee, the city may in its discretion waive any provision of this agreement, if such waiver is in the public interest.
2. The failure of the city on one or more occasions to exercise a right or to require compliance or performance under this franchise agreement, the
cable ordinance or any other applicable law shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of such right or a waiver of compliance or performance by the
city, nor to excuse the grantee from complying or performing, unless such right or such compliance or performance has been specifically waived in
writing.
3. Waiver of a breach of this agreement shall not be a waiver of any other breach, whether similar to or different from that waived. Neither the granting
of the franchise, nor any provision herein, nor any action by the city hereunder shall constitute a waiver of or a bar to the exercise of any
governmental right or power of the city, including without limitation the right of eminent domain.
K. No Recourse: Without limiting such immunities as the city or other persons may have under applicable law, a grantee will have no monetary recourse
against the city or its officials, boards, commissions, agents or employees for any loss, costs, expense or damage arising out of: 1) the construction,
operation or repair of its cable system, including in cases where the act or omission giving rise to the same was required under applicable law or
directed by the city; or 2) the acts or omissions of the city or any other entity using the public rights of way or other property under the city's control,
except acts and omissions of the city that involve gross negligence or intentional misconduct by the city. (Ord. 28-05, 5-2-2005)
11-3A-3: TRANSFERS:
The grantee shall comply with all requirements of the ordinance and applicable law regarding transfers. (Ord. 28-05, 5-2-2005)
11-3A-4: PROVISION OF CABLE SERVICE:
A. Line Extension Requirements:
1. Existing Boundaries: Within the city's boundaries as they existed on the effective date, the grantee shall extend its cable system to provide cable
service: a) to any dwelling unit; or b) to any school or facility owned or leased by the city, upon request, without charging more than the standard
installation charges. The grantee shall extend its cable system within such existing boundaries to provide cable service upon request to any business
requiring a standard installation. In the event that to provide cable service to any business would require other than a standard business installation,
as defined herein, beyond the public rights of way (for example, due to the need to cross a large parking lot), the grantee shall provide each such
installation to each standard point of demarcation outside the building at the standard installation charge for each connected demarcation point if the
owner of such business grants legal access and provides a conduit or other necessary physical pathway for grantee's facilities (for example, by
providing conduit space enabling the grantee to cross a large parking lot without extensive trenching).
2. Standard Business Installation: For purposes of subsection A1 of this section, a "standard business installation" shall mean a service drop of no
more than one hundred twenty five feet (125'), with no boring longer than required to pass underneath driveways a maximum of twenty five feet (25')
wide or sidewalks a maximum of five feet (5') wide, that does not require disruption of pavement or similar surfaces, providing the standard signal
strength for residences, using standard RG-6 residential drop cable.
3. New Areas: In any area annexed by the city after the effective date of this agreement:
a. From the date of annexation until three (3) years after that date, the grantee shall extend its cable system as necessary to provide cable service to
every school and government facility and every residential and nonresidential subscriber where the average potential subscriber density is at least
thirty (30) potential subscribers per linear mile of distribution network, or where (for residential dwelling units) the dwelling unit is within two
hundred feet (200') of any existing portion of the cable system, unless the grantee demonstrates to the city's satisfaction that extraordinary
circumstances, including, but not limited to, the existence of a wireline competitor in such annexed area that would, subsequent to the annexation,
offer a substantially equivalent level of service (including, but not limited to, PEG access and emergency override capability provided by grantee),
justify a complete, partial, temporary, and/or conditional waiver of this requirement, which waiver shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed.
b. Beginning three (3) years after the date of annexation, the grantee shall be subject to the same standard as applied within existing boundaries
pursuant to subsection A1 of this section.
c. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent the grantee from extending service to all units in an annexed area at an earlier date.
B. Continuity Of Service:
1. The grantee shall ensure that all subscribers receive continuous uninterrupted service. At the city's request, the grantee shall operate its system for
a temporary period (the "transition period") following the termination, sale, or transfer of its franchise as necessary to maintain service to subscribers,
and shall cooperate with the city to assure an orderly transition from it to another grantee. The transition period shall be no longer than the
reasonable period required to ensure that cable service will be available to subscribers, and shall not be longer than thirty six (36) months, unless
extended by the city for good cause. During the transition period, the grantee will continue to be obligated to comply with the terms and conditions of
this agreement and applicable laws and regulations.
2. If the grantee abandons its system during the franchise term, or fails to operate its system in accordance with the terms of this agreement during any
transition period, the city, at its option, may operate the system, designate another entity to operate the system temporarily until the grantee restores
service under conditions acceptable to the city or until the franchise is revoked and a new grantee selected by the city is providing service, or obtain
an injunction requiring the grantee to continue operations. If the city is required to operate or designate another entity to operate the cable system,
the grantee shall reimburse the city or its designee for all reasonable costs and damages incurred that are in excess of the revenues from the cable
system.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=803 295/716
3. The grantee shall be deemed to have abandoned its system if the grantee fails to provide cable service in accordance with its franchise over any
portion of the franchise area for ninety six (96) consecutive hours, unless the city authorizes a longer interruption of service or the failure is due to
force majeure as characterized herein, or the grantee, for any period, wilfully and without cause refuses to provide cable service in accordance with
its franchise over a substantial portion of the franchise area. (Ord. 28-05, 5-2-2005)
11-3A-5: SYSTEM FACILITIES, EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES:

apply to the grantee's headend, each fiber optic node, and any other location(s) within the system necessary to maintain service to subscribers who
have power for not less than three (3) hours in the event of an electrical outage affecting the system. In addition, the system's electronics shall be
capable of passing through the signals received at the headend without substantial alteration or deterioration (thus, for example, the system shall
include components so that a signal received at the headend in color may be received by a subscriber in color and a stereo signal in stereo). The
grantee shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations concerning system compatibility with subscribers' television receivers and/or recording
devices. Nothing herein shall prevent grantee from converting digital signals other than high definition signals for transmission to subscribers in an
analog format. The city may require grantee to add equipment and facilities to its system as necessary to comply with this subsection, and may
establish reasonable deadlines for completion of that work.
2. Compliance With FCC Regulations: The grantee shall comply with all FCC regulations regarding scrambling or other encryption of signals.
3. No Deterioration To Access Signals: The system shall be so constructed and operated that there is no significant deterioration in the quality of PEG
access signals or leased access signals, either upstream or downstream, as compared with any other channel on the system. Deterioration refers to
any signal problem, including, but not limited to, ghost images and other interference and distortions.
4. Consumer Equipment For Lease Or Sale: Subject to applicable law or regulation, as part of the system, the grantee shall offer every subscriber the
opportunity to use equipment that allows subscribers to view a program on one channel while recording a program on another channel.
5. Parental Control: The grantee shall ensure that means are available to enable subscribers to completely block out audio and video on any undesired
channels on the system.

subscriber using, for example, a private identification number or other individual selection procedure.
7. Service To Persons With Disabilities: The system shall transmit closed captions for all programming that includes a closed caption signal. For
hearing impaired subscribers, the grantee shall provide information concerning the cost and availability of equipment to facilitate the reception of
services for the hearing impaired. In addition, the grantee must have means available, and a publicly listed telephone number for such means, that
will allow hearing or speech impaired persons to contact the grantee.
B. System Functionality:
1. The cable system shall have the following characteristics:
a. Bandwidth of at least seven hundred fifty (750) MHz on all active components and at least one GHz for all passive components;
b. No more than five hundred (500) homes on the average, and no more than seven hundred (700) homes in any case, served from any fiber node,
with sufficient fibers to each node so that each five hundred (500) home node could readily be converted to a node of one hundred fifty (150) or
two hundred (200) subscribers;
c. No more than four (4) active components in a cascade from any node; and
d. Bidirectional activation with a clean return path permitting a current minimum average of approximately five hundred twelve (512) Kbps upstream.
2. The grantee shall implement status monitoring throughout the cable system that will continuously monitor key parameters of all set-top and other
devices in the cable system including all hubs and nodes. The status monitoring system shall alert the grantee when and where a power supply has
lost commercial power and is running on backup power.
3. The system shall provide two-way capability.
4. No later than June 30, 2006, the grantee shall ensure that all broadcast television signals carried on the cable system are transmitted to the headend
over direct fiber connections either from the broadcast origination point, or from an over the air reception point located in such a way that the signal is
not at any time significantly degraded from its level of quality at the broadcast origination point.
C. System Upgrade: Within twenty four (24) months after the effective date, the grantee shall complete a system upgrade to a bandwidth of at least eight
hundred sixty (860) MHz ("system upgrade").
D. System Infrastructure For Services To Business:
1. Within two (2) years after the effective date of this agreement, the grantee shall install at least six (6) fibers for the grantee's own use in offering
services to businesses, over and above any fibers installed for the I-Net or for the offering of services to residential subscribers, to the edge of the
Dubuque industrial center west and the Dubuque technology park.
2. Wherever the grantee installs fiber in the I-Net pursuant to subsection 11-3A-6H2 of this article, but excluding I-Net laterals, the grantee shall also
install, at its own expense, at least six (6) fibers for the grantee's own use in offering services to businesses, over and above any fibers installed for
the I-Net or for the offering of services to residential subscribers.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=803 296/716
3. Within six (6) months (excluding any delay necessitated by weather conditions) after a customer signs an agreement with the grantee on reasonable
commercial terms requiring a direct fiber connection to the customer's premises, the grantee shall construct any necessary fiber line extension in the
public rights of way at no additional cost to the customer.
E. Technical Standards: The cable system shall meet or exceed the technical standards set forth in 47 CFR section 76.601 and any other applicable
technical standards.
F. Interconnection: The city may use the I-Net, or facilities supplied by the city, to interconnect with other communications systems, provided that such use
of the I-Net is consistent with this agreement.
G. Emergency Alert System:
1. The grantee shall install and maintain for use by the city an emergency alert system (EAS) meeting all applicable requirements of federal law.
2. The grantee's system shall include the capability for the city to access the EAS using nonlocation specific technology, without the assistance of the
grantee, in the event of emergency or for reasonable tests, to override at least the audio on all channels on the grantee's system, to the extent that
such override does not interfere with the federally mandated EAS, applicable state or local plans or with broadcaster preemption of override of
individual signals. When negotiating carriage of broadcast signals, the grantee shall use reasonable commercial efforts to avoid such broadcaster
preemption of such messages. Where the grantee is not able to avoid such preemption, the grantee shall provide written notice to the city identifying
the broadcast signal.
3. The grantee shall cooperate with the city in any test of the EAS.
4. Except to the extent expressly prohibited by law, the city will hold the grantee, its officers, employees and assigns harmless from any claims arising
out of the city's use of the EAS.
H. Coordination Of Trenching:
1. Grantee shall provide the city with reasonable advance notice of any plans to install underground facilities in the grantee's trenches in the city's
public rights of way, so that the city may at its discretion install conduit and/or fiber of its own at the same time. The city shall provide grantee with
reasonable advance notice of any planned street openings in the city's public rights of way, so that grantee may at its discretion install facilities of its
own at the same time.
2. A party installing conduit and/or fiber pursuant to subsection H1 of this section shall not be required to pay a share of the trenching cost. However, if
the city either: a) establishes a communications utility or its equivalent; or b) competes directly or indirectly, including in any joint venture or other
cooperative agreement, in providing third parties with services also provided by Mediacom, then the city shall pay half of Mediacom's trenching costs
where the city has installed conduit and/or fiber in Mediacom's trenches pursuant to subsection H1 of this section at any time from the effective date
forward and shall continue to pay for future installations throughout the term of this franchise agreement, and Mediacom shall pay half of the city's
trenching costs where Mediacom has installed conduit and/or fiber in the city's trenches pursuant to subsection H1 of this section at any time from
the effective date forward and shall continue to pay for future installations throughout the term of this franchise agreement. The costs paid for such
trenching shall be ninety four cents ($0.94) per foot for simple trenching, three dollars fifteen cents ($3.15) per foot for pneumatic bore, and eight
dollars ($8.00) for directional bore, each adjusted according to the inflation index.
3. Grantee and the city shall work together to develop routine procedures by which this coordination can be accomplished.
I. Updating:
1. No later than October 1 of each year beginning with the first year and ending after the twelfth year of the franchise term, grantee shall provide three
hundred thousand dollars ($300,000.00) for the purpose of updating the cable system. Such monies shall not be used for operational, repair,
maintenance, replacement, or line extension purposes, but shall be used to improve the technology and capabilities of the existing system.
2. The city and grantee shall jointly determine how to most appropriately expend such monies for updating the cable system. Updating monies shall be
expended as agreed by the city and grantee; provided, however, that this agreement shall constitute the city's approval for the grantee to expend all
or part of the first four (4) years' installments of the updating monies as specified in subsection I1 of this section to the extent necessary to cover the
actual reasonable costs of the system upgrade carried out pursuant to subsection C of this section.
3. Updating monies may be expended as such become available, may be advanced on account for expenditure, or may be invested for later
expenditure along with all interest earned thereon, as may be agreed by the city and grantee. An agreement on any of these three (3) uses shall
satisfy the requirement for agreement stated in subsection I2 of this section.
4. At the beginning of the fifth year of the term, and at the beginning of each subsequent year, after reviewing grantee's financial reports, the city may,
at its sole discretion, require the grantee to secure all or any part of the updating fund for the following year by instrument(s) that may be drawn on by
the city for the purposes specified in subsection I1 of this section pursuant to the procedures specified in subsection 11-3A-9E of this article and
consistent with the conditions specified in subsection I2 of this section. If the city exercises this option, the grantee shall determine whether such
instrument(s) shall be: a) an escrow; b) an irrevocable letter of credit; or c) any combination thereof.
5. If any updating monies remain unexpended as of fifteen (15) years after the effective date of this agreement, such funds shall be distributed equally
among the then basic subscribers on their statements for the following month.
J. Senior Discount: The grantee shall offer eligible senior citizen subscribers a discount on the rates for grantee's family cable level of service (a purchase
of both the basic service and the first cable programming services tier as those terms are defined in the cable act on the effective date) of no less than
ten percent (10%) per month. Senior citizen subscribers shall be eligible for this discount if they provide documentation of age (65 or older), residency
at the service address, and that at least one utility is billed in the senior citizen's name at the service address. (Ord. 28-05, 5-2-2005)

which channels shall be in addition to any capacity provided on the institutional network pursuant to subsection H of this section.
2. The grantee shall provide any access channels on the lowest level of service throughout the life of the franchise, or if there is no basic tier (e.g., if a
basic tier is not required by federal law and federal law does not prohibit the city from requiring a basic tier and the city imposes the same
requirements on all cable service providers in the city over which the city has jurisdiction to do so), the grantee shall provide the access channels as
part of the cable service provided to any subscriber, at no additional charge, and so that the channels are viewable by the subscriber without the
need for additional equipment. If channels are selected through a menu system, the access channels shall be displayed as prominently as
commercial programming choices offered by grantee.
3. At such time as the city authorizes conversion of an analog PEG channel to digital format on the system, the city may request and the grantee shall,
within six (6) months, migrate such PEG channel to digital format, and grantee shall install such headend equipment as is necessary to cablecast in
high definition format PEG programming produced in such format.
4. Access channel assignments shall be the same throughout the system. Access channel assignments shall not be changed unless there is good
cause and the city consents to the change. Such consent to a channel assignment change shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any such
reassignment must be to a channel of technical quality at least equivalent to that of other channels on the system. In the event of such a
reassignment, grantee shall pay the costs of all equipment reasonably required due to the reassignment, and shall provide notices to educate
viewers as to the reassignment. In the event grantee makes any change in the cable system and related equipment, or facilities, or in its signal
delivery technology, which would have a material adverse impact on the transmission or signal quality of access programming, the grantee shall, at
its own expense, take all necessary steps to ensure that, at a minimum, such quality is maintained at no less than the previous level.
5. Upon the conversion of the entire cable system to digital transmission or December 31, 2006, whichever occurs first, the grantee shall provide the
city with PEG capacity for video programming that may be accessed by subscribers through use of standard digital equipment compatible with the
grantee's cable system using the grantee's "on demand" capabilities. The grantee shall provide storage capacity for up to twenty (20) hours of on
demand PEG programming at any given time. The city and the grantee may by mutual agreement arrange for additional capacity on terms to be
determined at the time of agreement. If the city wishes to store additional programming on its own servers or facilities, the grantee shall cooperate
with the city in making such additional programming available through the same on demand methods. Within thirty (30) days after providing such
capability, the grantee shall provide the city with an encoder that may be used to digitize PEG programming for use in this on demand arrangement.
6. If grantee makes changes to its cable system that require additional equipment to deliver the PEG programming to subscribers, grantee shall make
such equipment available.
7. The city agrees that its designated educational and governmental access channels and capacity are not to be used for any for profit, commercial
purposes by the city or third parties. Use of such channels or capacity is not "for profit" or "commercial" solely because an access programmer or
access channel manager has more revenues than expenses, or because the activity in which it is engaged is provided on a for profit basis by private
entities in other communities or the city. Nothing prevents the city from authorizing charges to users or viewers to pay for services such as fees for
video class instruction or charges to recover the cost of special use equipment, or as they may be required to charge under applicable law.
B. Capital Grant For Access Equipment And Facilities:
1. In addition to the franchise fee, the grantee shall deposit one and three-fourths percent (1.75%) of its gross revenues annually, paid at the same time
and in the same manner as the franchise fee, in an interest bearing account upon which the city may draw for capital support for PEG and I-Net use,
in its sole discretion (except that the city shall not use more than half of the PEG capital support fund for I-Net support, as distinct from support for
PEG access video programming), at any time while the franchise remains in effect (the "PEG capital support fund"). Any unused funds shall be
returned to the grantee at the end of the franchise term.
2. For purposes of this subsection, "gross revenues" shall be construed to include all revenues from types of service which on January 1, 2005, were
considered "cable service" as that term was used on that date in 47 USC section 522(6), whether or not such types of service are determined or held
to be "cable service" at any later date.
C. Public Access:
1. Grantee shall have a continuing obligation, throughout the life of this franchise, to provide studio facilities, production assistance, editing, scheduling
and playback, training, outreach, management, and administrative support for users of the public access channels at the level provided as of January
1, 2005. Equipment for the public access studio shall be provided using the PEG capital support fund as determined by the city pursuant to
subsection B of this section. The ability to produce and show programming on the public access channels shall be available to any person who
resides within the city limits, and any institution, organization or agency with either a principal place of business in the city, or a principal regular
meeting place within the city limits, on a first come, first served basis, and shall not require applicant to exercise editorial control over such use,
pursuant to 47 USC section 531(e).
2. In particular, and without limitation, grantee shall ensure that production facilities and support are available at least fifty seven (57) hours per week to
provide to interested members of the public training and assistance in the use of PEG access production equipment and assistance in the production
of PEG programming. In weeks including one or more legal holidays, such fifty seven (57) hour requirement shall be reduced accordingly. The
regular operating hours of the PEG access facilities shall include some evening hours, and shall include some Saturday hours by appointment. The
grantee shall maintain all PEG access equipment, provide for the check in and check out of PEG access equipment, and schedule the use of the
grantee's facilities by persons producing PEG programs.
D. Return Feed From Facilities:
1. The grantee shall connect the following access origination sites by dedicated fiber optic upstream feeds to the headend, including both the fiber itself
and all terminal equipment necessary for transmission of the signals for each access channel to be originated there in accordance with the schedule
for connection of I-Net sites as listed in section 11-3A-12 of this article, except for the public access studio, which shall be connected during the first
year of I-Net construction:
a. Public access studio.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=803 298/716
b. Public school central administrative office at The Forum, Chaney Road.
c. Master control room at Loras College.
d. City hall annex.
2. The dedicated connections required by subsection D1 of this section shall be designed and built to include all equipment, including, but not limited
to, laser transmitters, receivers, modulators, and processors, drops and wiring, so that each such center can send signals to the headend on at least
two (2) channels initially and up to two (2) additional channels if additional downstream channels are activated for PEG use; and so that the facilities
can each remotely and without assistance from the grantee or access to its headend: a) receive signals from distant locations; b) route signals
originated at that center or at other locations onto any of the access channels on the regular subscriber network; and c) otherwise control the signals
to allow for smooth breaks, transitions, insertion of station IDs and other material. Grantee shall bear the cost of acquiring and maintaining all fiber
and equipment necessary to meet this requirement, except that either the city or the owners of the sites shall be responsible for acquiring and
maintaining the transmission equipment at the studio end (as distinct from the headend) of the connections for the locations listed in subsections
D1b, D1c, and D1d of this section for the educational and governmental channels.
3. Grantee shall ensure that programming received via the upstream feeds is retransmitted as sent by the PEG programmer, without changing the
attributes of the signal in such a way as to effectively degrade the output. The facilities and equipment provided would not be adequate if there would
be more deterioration on channels set aside for public, educational and government use on the I-Net or subscriber network than on other channels
on the cable system. Deterioration refers to any signal problem reflected in FCC technical standards, including, but not limited to, ghost images and
other interference, distortions, degradation of chroma and luminance, and imperfections.
4. The grantee shall continue to maintain and operate the existing upstream connections until the I-Net is fully functional as specified in subsection H13
of this section and as such will allow transmission of PEG programming from the Carnegie-Stout public library and the Dubuque County courthouse.
Grantee shall not be required to provide the transmission equipment for the Carnegie-Stout public library and the Dubuque County courthouse once
the city migrates the upstream feeds from such locations to the I-Net.
E. Management Of Channels:
1. The five (5) access channels shall be managed as follows:
a. Two (2) public access: By grantee.
b. One governmental access: By the city.
c. Two (2) educational access: One by the Dubuque Community School District; one jointly by the other educational institutions in the city.
2. The city may at any time designate one or more entities, including a nonprofit access management corporation, to perform any or all of the following
functions:
a. To manage any public, educational, or government access channel;
b. To establish policies for the use of access channels and facilities; and/or
c. To manage any necessary scheduling or allocation of capacity on the institutional network.
3. In the event that the city designates an entity other than the grantee to manage the public access channels, the city will provide all public access
programming to grantee for distribution on grantee's system simultaneously with distribution of such programming by any other provider authorized
to distribute such programming.
F. Editorial Control: Except as expressly permitted by federal law, the grantee shall not exercise any editorial control over the content of programming on
the designated public, educational and governmental access channels (except for such programming as the grantee may produce and cablecast on
such channels).
G. Cable Service To Certain Facilities:
1. Upon request of the city, grantee shall without charge provide one activated outlet for cable service at each school, and each facility owned or leased
by the city, as shall be designated by the city from time to time. For annexed areas, such service shall be provided in accordance with the line
extension requirements set forth in subsection 11-3A-4A3 of this article.
2. The institution being served may further distribute within the school or facility any cable service it lawfully receives, consistent with the mission of the
institution, at its own expense.
3. The grantee shall provide basic service free of charge to those facilities specified in subsection G1 of this section. At its sole discretion, the grantee
may also provide higher levels of service to such facilities free of charge.
4. The grantee shall also provide a converter, decoder, or similar equipment if necessary for user equipment (such as television sets) to receive basic
service at each such outlet, with all capabilities or options afforded at a given time by the system. Grantee shall ensure that all signals are provided
at such outlets with sufficient strength that they can be further amplified to distribute them throughout the site.
5. The grantee shall install a maximum two hundred foot (200') service drop and maintain one connection for internet access to one computer terminal
in each school and library within the franchise area. Any additional costs will be borne by the requesting school or library on a time and material
basis. All schools and libraries receiving such service will enter into the grantee's standard service agreement. In the event that such institutions wish
to create an internal network, the city agrees that such institutions will contact the grantee for a proposal to provide such networking, but the
institutions shall be under no obligation to accept such a proposal.
H. Institutional Network:
1. Definitions: For purposes of this subsection, the following terms shall mean:

ninety (90) minutes of a call from a primary contact. (Ord. 28-05, 5-2-2005)
g. Single mode fibers will be built to each I-Net site as designated in section 11-3A-12 of this article. At each I-Net site, at the city's option, either: 1)
fibers shall be terminated using industry standard connectors at a demarcation point to be agreed upon by the grantee and the user up to fifteen
feet (15') inside the building entry wall and consistent with the grantee's direction of approach to the building, consistent with the FCC's rules as
amended from time to time (the "demarcation point"); or 2) the grantee shall provide a coil of fiber optic cable, without termination or connector, of
a length reasonably requested by the user to permit the user or the facility owner to bring the connection further inside the building beyond that
demarcation point in accordance with normal industry practice. Any I-Net fiber starting at the demarcation point and extending outward from the
building shall be deemed to be on the grantee's side of the demarcation point, and any I-Net fiber starting at the demarcation point and extending
further inside the building shall be deemed to be on the user's side of the demarcation point. The city and grantee shall work together to determine
demarcation points for individual I-Net sites. (Ord. 40-06, 6-5-2006)
h. The fiber optic plant shall be installed to industry standards. In no case shall fiber losses exceed 0.35 dB/km. at 1310 nm, and 0.25 dB/km. at 1550
nm. Splices shall not exceed 0.1 dB per splice, and connectors shall not exceed 0.75 dB per connector pair. Maximum signal loss for any link shall
not exceed the manufacturer's passive cable attenuation specifications, adjusted for cable lengths, splice loss and connector loss. The grantee
shall provide documentation of acceptance testing pursuant to subsection H4 of this section.
i. Grantee shall maintain the I-Net fiber plant at a high level of reliability and will ensure that such I-Net fiber plant does not have an unreasonable
number of outages as compared with other fiber based institutional networks provided by cable operators pursuant to cable franchises.
(1) The fiber I-Net shall be considered as experiencing an "outage" when any grantee provided fiber optic network component or grantee provided
interconnect precludes or substantially impairs the transmission of information on the I-Net or a portion thereof.
(2) "Outage" conditions shall not include: a) scheduled preventive maintenance as long as the city's I-Net coordinator is notified at least five (5)
business days in advance; or b) force majeure.
j. Aerial cable for the I-Net may be installed freestanding or overlashed to existing strand. New underground fiber optic cable shall be buried in
conduit such as that composed of concrete, PVC pipe, or polyethylene pipe. (Ord. 28-05, 5-2-2005)
k. The grantee shall begin construction of the I-Net within three (3) months after the effective date. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the city
manager and grantee, grantee shall complete construction of the I-Net plant by the end of eighteen (18) months after the effective date. (Ord. 68-
06, 11-6-2006)

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=803 300/716
m. All I-Net wiring on the user's side of the demarcation point and all I-Net electronics are the sole responsibility and property of the user; provided,
however, that the city may use monies from the PEG capital support fund at its discretion for such wiring and electronics. All costs associated with
locating or repairing any failure which is reported to the grantee but which subsequently is determined to have occurred on the user's side of the
demarcation point shall be paid for by the user, except to the extent that the grantee's negligence or intentional misconduct caused such failure.
n. All costs associated with locating or repairing any failure which is determined to have occurred on the grantee's side of the demarcation point shall
be the responsibility of the grantee pursuant to subsection H8 of this section, except to the extent that the user's or the city's negligence or
intentional misconduct may adversely affect such equipment and facilities have caused such failure.
3. Coordination Of Design And Construction Of I-Net:
a. The grantee shall perform continuity tests for I-Net segments in phases as construction is completed. (Ord. 28-05, 5-2-2005)
b. The grantee shall submit detailed site plans for design and construction of each I-Net at least fifteen (15) days prior to the anticipated start of
construction. The city shall review and approve such detailed site plans at least five (5) business days before the anticipated start of construction,
and before the grantee begins actual construction of the segment. Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The grantee may submit all
I-Net construction information in a single permit application. The city agrees to process the permit application within five (5) business days. (Ord.
40-06, 6-5-2006)
c. The I-Net design shall include specification of the industry standard connectors to be used and the demarcation points for all I-Net sites.
d. The grantee shall coordinate its design and construction planning with the city so that, in addition to the notice provided to the city pursuant to the
system design submission process generally, the city shall have as much notice as reasonably possible so that it can plan for activation and use of
the I-Net as the grantee builds out the I-Net fiber.
e. The city shall notify the grantee in writing prior to the activation of any I-Net segment. (Ord. 28-05, 5-2-2005)
4. Acceptance: Construction standards shall be as specified in the ordinance. The acceptance procedure for each I-Net site is as follows: three (3)
business days in advance of testing, the grantee shall inform the I-Net coordinator of any continuity test. The city shall have the option to be present
at the test. The grantee shall perform the test after terminating the fibers on both ends and will conduct the test from the connector output at both
1310 nm and 1550 nm using an optical time-domain reflectometer (OTDR) from both ends of the fiber (at the user site and at the headend or
aggregation site). The grantee shall submit the continuity test results to the city in electronic format and optionally in paper format; the city may
require retesting of the segment if it is not satisfied with the results of the grantee's tests. The results shall be deemed accepted if the city does not
object to such results within ten (10) business days. When I-Net construction is completed, one bound, paper copy containing all test results shall be
submitted to the city. (Ord. 40-06, 6-5-2006)
5. Warranty: The fiber installed by the grantee pursuant to this section shall be warranted against defects in materials and workmanship for twelve (12)
months after acceptance. This warranty is in addition to, and does not relieve the grantee from, its maintenance responsibilities pursuant to
subsection H8 of this section.
6. Indefeasible Rights Of Use:
a. The city shall possess the indefeasible right to use fiber optic plant dedicated to the I-Net and any extensions or replacements thereof installed by
the grantee, subject only to such mechanic's or other liens as grantee may have pursuant to state law (the "indefeasible rights of use"). The
indefeasible rights of use shall be coterminous with this franchise agreement.
b. In order to protect the city's right to continue using the institutional network pursuant to this franchise agreement, the grantee shall cooperate with
the city in recording its indefeasible right of use interest in the fibers as defined in this franchise agreement with the state department of
assessments and taxation, the city clerk, or such other office as may be appropriate.
7. Disposition Of I-Net: Upon termination of this franchise agreement, the city shall have the option to purchase the I-Net from grantee at a price
determined as follows:
a. Beginning upon expiration of the fifteen (15) year term of the franchise agreement, provided such franchise agreement is not terminated or
revoked prior to that date, the purchase price shall be an amount equal to the net book value of the I-Net as measured by the cost of the I-Net less
the accumulated depreciation of the I-Net assets with both cost and accumulated depreciation computed in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles and consistent with the amounts and methodologies used to report the same to shareholders ("net book value"); or
b. If the franchise agreement is terminated or revoked in accordance with the terms of this franchise agreement and ordinance prior to the expiration
of its term, the purchase price shall be an equitable amount taking into consideration the value of the I-Net to the city and other authorized users,
but in no event less than the net book value as of the date of termination or revocation.
8. Maintenance: The grantee shall maintain, repair and, as necessary, replace I-Net fiber plant on the grantee's side of the demarcation point in
accordance with the following procedures and conditions:
a. Preventive And Routine Maintenance: The grantee shall perform routine and preventive maintenance on I-Net plant in the same time and in the
same fashion as routine and preventive maintenance are performed for the subscriber network, without charge to the city or other users. In the
course of performing routine and preventive maintenance, the grantee shall use its best efforts to identify potential trouble conditions warranting
repair or replacement of I-Net plant not bundled together with subscriber network plant. The grantee and the city shall, as promptly as practicable,
report potential trouble conditions to the other party.
b. Outage Categories: Response and restoration times are determined by the category of service outage as follows:
(1) Critical Outage: Loss of service to one of the fiber routes feeding a critical facility. A maximum of twenty five (25) such critical fiber routes will be
designated by the city by written notice to the grantee after the effective date and before completion of the I-Net. The city may subsequently
change which fiber routes are designated critical, as long as the total number does not exceed the maximum of twenty five (25) specified above.
Any such change shall be provided by the city to the grantee in writing.
(2) Major Outage: Total loss of service to an I-Net site other than one listed as critical pursuant to subsection H8b(1) of this section.
(3) Minor Outage: Loss of service on a single fiber to any I-Net site where any traffic can be placed immediately on another fiber at that site. If it is
not possible to reroute traffic in this way immediately, the outage is a major outage.
(4) Service Interruption: Reduction in signal throughput to the point where the signal on a circuit falls below acceptable standards.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=803 301/716
c. Response To Outages: The response time (the point at which the grantee is engaged in restoration of service) for all service outages, whether
reported to the grantee by the user or independently identified by the grantee, shall be as specified in subsection H8f of this section. Upon
identification of a service outage, the grantee shall, within such response time, have qualified personnel on site to investigate the outage, assess
the cause and commence necessary repairs. To the extent that necessary repairs resulting in restoration of connectivity on the I-Net can be
immediately accomplished, the grantee shall effect such repairs in connection with its investigation of the cause of the service outage. To the
extent that repairs cannot be immediately effected, the grantee shall, within the response time, inform the city I-Net coordinator of the apparent
cause of the service outage, the anticipated time for restoration of connectivity.
d. Restoration Of Service:
(1) The grantee shall, to the maximum extent practicable, effect restoration of connectivity of any category of service involving I-Net plant that is
bundled together with subscriber network plant at the same time as restoration of collocated subscriber network plant.
(2) The grantee shall effect restoration of connectivity of I-Net plant that is not bundled together with subscriber network plant as promptly as
practicable within the estimated restoration times reported to the city pursuant to subsection H8f of this section and shall use its best efforts to
effect such restoration within the service objectives set forth in subsection H8f of this section.
(3) In the case of a service outage involving more than one category of service outage or multiple service outages involving more than one
category of service outage, the grantee shall restore connectivity in the order specified in subsection H8b of this section, or such other order of
priority as the city reasonably requires. In all cases involving service outages resulting from I-Net plant that is bundled together with subscriber
network plant, the grantee shall effect restoration of connectivity of any category of service involving I-Net plant that is bundled together with
subscriber network plant at the same time as restoration of collocated subscriber network plant.
e. Cost Of Maintenance: The grantee shall provide maintenance for I-Net fiber plant without any charge to the city or any other authorized user,
except for any maintenance required due to any negligence or intentional misconduct of the city or any other authorized user.
f. Response And Restoration Times: For response and restoration of service as specified in subsections H8b(4) and H8d of this section, the grantee
shall respond as soon as practicable, but within the following time frames, commencing from the time the grantee: 1) obtains actual knowledge of
the problem; or 2) receives notice of the problem from the I-Net coordinator (collectively "notice"). All permanent repairs shall be completed within
thirty (30) days after notice, unless otherwise agreed to by the city.
(1) Critical Outage: Response on site within two (2) hours after notice, minimum temporary repair (fully operational connectivity, end to end)
completed within four (4) hours after notice.
(2) All Other (Major Outage, Minor Outage, And Service Interruption): Response within two (2) hours after notice between eight o'clock (8:00) A.M.
and six o'clock (6:00) P.M. on business days and four (4) hours after notice otherwise; temporary repair completed within eight (8) hours after
notice.
Where, for reasons beyond the grantee's control, restoration of service or permanent repair cannot be completed in the above time periods even
with the exercise of all due diligence (for example, where the grantee is delayed in obtaining access to poles or conduits or facilities), the
grantee shall complete the restoration of service in the shortest time practicable and permanent repair within thirty (30) days of completion of a
temporary repair.
g. Maintenance Defined: For purposes of this subsection, the term "maintenance" shall mean any action required to restore physical fiber optic
connectivity on the grantee's side of the demarcation point to the performance standards specified in subsection H2 of this section.
h. Damaged Cable; Claims For Damages: If any fiber optic cable in which the city has an indefeasible right of use should be cut or damaged, and the
responsible party is identified, then the city shall support the grantee's claims for damages against the responsible party.
i. False Trouble Reports; Fee: In the event that a primary contact or designee requests on site service from grantee and grantee responds on site
and determines that the I-Net is functioning properly on grantee's side of the demarcation point, such trouble call shall be deemed a "false trouble
report". After an authorized user accumulates four (4) false trouble reports in one calendar year, grantee may charge, and the city shall require
authorized user to pay, a false trouble report fee in an amount not to exceed fifty dollars ($50.00) each for the fifth through eighth false trouble
report in the same calendar year and an amount not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00) each for the ninth and each additional false trouble
report in the same calendar year.
9. Use:
a. The parties authorized to use the I-Net ("authorized users") shall be, to the extent approved by the city:
(1) Those entities for which I-Net sites will be constructed pursuant to section 11-3A-12 of this article.
(2) Additional local, state and federal government entities, educational entities (including, but not limited to, schools and museums), and entities
jointly approved by the city and grantee, that have executed agreements with the city which include commitments for noncommercial use of the
I-Net and are subject to the same restrictions as are similar entities pursuant to subsections H9c, H9d, and H9e of this section.
b. The city shall require all authorized users to provide the city and grantee name and contact information for a "primary contact", including twenty
four (24) hour telephone contact information, and to timely update such information as it changes from time to time. The primary contact shall have
primary responsibility for providing access to grantee as necessary for grantee to assess, repair or perform corrective measures at I-Net locations.
Unless otherwise specified by the city from time to time, the primary contact for all city I-Net sites shall be the I-Net coordinator.
c. The city shall not use, or permit any authorized user to use, the I-Net for resale or for commercial purposes. "Commercial" use does not include
(by way of example and without limitation) internet access by authorized users, or internet access by visitors to public libraries.
d. Those authorized users designated as "restricted" (R) or as "emergency" (E) in section 11-3A-12 of this article, such as Iowa state sites and
colleges, may not use the I-Net on a regular basis for communications that travel over facilities that are not part of the I-Net or of the institution's
own internal network, except that use for reception and/or distribution of noncommercial public service content shall not be restricted.
e. Those authorized users designated as "emergency" (E) in section 11-3A-12 of this article, such as hospitals, may use the I-Net only for community

6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.

1. Each year, as compensation for use of public rights of way, the grantee shall pay to the city a franchise fee of five percent (5%) of gross revenues.
2. For each whole or partial year that this agreement or any extension thereof is in effect, the franchise fees due to the city shall be calculated on an
annual basis corresponding to the city's fiscal year. The grantee shall make its payment of franchise fees on the first day of the fiscal year for which
the fees are calculated and due.
3. The amount due on the first day of the fiscal year shall be no less than ninety percent (90%) of the total franchise fees anticipated to be due for that
year, as determined by the city ninety (90) days prior to the beginning of the applicable fiscal year and communicated to the grantee.
4. No later than the twentieth day after the end of each fiscal quarter, the grantee shall report to the city, in such detail as the city may require, its gross
revenues for the fiscal quarter immediately preceding, and shall remit therewith the amount by which any fee due for that quarter exceeds twenty five
percent (25%) of the amount paid on the first day of that fiscal year. In the event the amounts paid the city during the fiscal year exceed the total
amount due for that fiscal year, the excess shall be refunded to the grantee within twenty (20) days after the filing of its fourth quarterly report and its
giving the city notice that a refund is due.
5. All payments due the city shall be made and delivered to the office of the city manager or his designee, no later than twelve o'clock (12:00) noon
local time of the date due, or, if those offices are closed on that day, no later than twelve o'clock (12:00) noon local time on the next day such offices
are open for business.
B. Final Payment: Upon the termination, transfer, sale, or revocation of this agreement, the grantee shall immediately submit to the city manager a
financial statement showing the gross revenues of the grantee for the time elapsed since the last quarter for which the grantee has paid in full to the
city the required franchise fees. The grantee shall pay to the city all fees due not later than thirty (30) days following such termination, but prior to the
termination of its performance bond.
C. Supporting Information: Each franchise fee payment shall be submitted with supporting detail and a statement certified by the grantee's chief financial
officer or an independent certified public accountant, reflecting the total amount of monthly gross revenues for the payment period and a breakdown by
major revenue categories (such as basic service, cable programming service, premium service, etc.). The city shall have the right to require further
reasonable supporting information.
D. Late Payments: In the event that any payment due the city is not made on or before the applicable due date and hour fixed in any section of this
agreement, the payment shall be considered delinquent and in violation of this agreement, and shall be subject to the remedies and procedures
outlined in section 11-3A-9 of this article. In addition, the grantee shall pay interest charges computed from such due date, at an annual rate equal to
the commercial prime interest rate of the city's primary depository bank during the period such unpaid amount is owed. The interest shall be treated as
a cost incidental to enforcing the franchise.
E. Audit:
1. The city shall have the right to inspect and copy records and the rights to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this
agreement, whether the records are held by the grantee, an affiliate, or any other entity that collects or receives funds related to the grantee's
operation in the city, including, by way of illustration and not limitation, any entity that sells advertising on the grantee's behalf.
2. The grantee shall be responsible for making available to the city for inspection and analysis all records necessary to confirm the accurate payment of
franchise fees, without regard to by whom they are held. The grantee shall maintain such records for the term of its franchise agreement, and any
renewals or extensions thereof.
3. The city's audit expenses shall be borne by the city unless the audit discloses an underpayment in total of at least five percent (5%), after taking into
account payments resulting from the quarterly true-ups pursuant to subsection A4 of this section, in which case the costs of the audit shall be borne
by the grantee as a cost incidental to the enforcement of the franchise. Any additional amounts due to the city as a result of the audit shall be paid
within thirty (30) days following written notice to the grantee by the city of the underpayment, which notice shall include a copy of the audit report. If
recomputation results in additional revenue to be paid to the city, such amount shall be subject to interest as specified in subsection D of this section.
4. The grantee shall maintain its fiscal and financial records and have all relevant fiscal and financial records maintained by others on its behalf in such
a manner as to enable the city to determine gross revenues. (Ord. 28-05, 5-2-2005)
11-3A-8: LIABILITIES:
A. Indemnification By Grantee: The grantee shall indemnify the city against any third party action against the city arising out of the grantee's negligence or
intentional misconduct. The grantee shall not be required to indemnify the city for the negligent or intentionally wrongful acts of the city, its officials,
boards, commissions, agents or employees. This provision shall not be construed to grant a right of action to any third party.
B. Indemnification By City: The city shall indemnify the grantee against any third party action against the grantee arising out of the city's negligence or
intentional misconduct. The city shall not be required to indemnify the grantee for the negligent or intentionally wrongful acts of the grantee, its officers,
boards, agents or employees. This provision shall not be construed to grant a right of action to any third party.
C. Indemnification Procedures: The city or grantee, as the case may be ("indemnified party"), shall promptly notify the party against whom indemnification
under this agreement is sought (the "indemnifying party"), in writing, of any claim for indemnification, specifying in reasonable detail the nature of the
loss, and, if known, the amount, or an estimate of the amount, of the liability arising therefrom. The indemnifying party may within ten (10) days after
receiving such notice provide the indemnified party with written notice that it will assume defense of the matter. The indemnified party may also
participate in this defense directly, at its own expense. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such claim effected without
its prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that if the indemnifying party does not actually assume the defense of a
claim within thirty (30) days after notice thereof, the indemnified party may settle or defend such claim without the consent of the indemnifying party.
The indemnifying party, if it assumes the defense of a claim, shall not settle such claim without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, which
shall not unreasonably be withheld.

11-3A-9: PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES AND REMEDIES:
A. Performance Bond:
1. Amount: Grantee shall obtain and maintain during the entire term of the franchise, and any renewal or extensions thereof, except as provided in
subsection A3 or B of this section, a performance bond in the city's favor, in the amount of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00), to
ensure the grantee's faithful performance of its obligations and payment of any sum due to the city pursuant to this franchise agreement or
ordinance. The bond shall be substantially in the form provided in exhibit C attached to the ordinance codified herein.
2. Issuance; Approval: The performance bond shall be issued by a surety with an A-1 or better rating of insurance in "Best's Key Rating Guide,
Property/Casualty Edition"; shall be subject to the approval of the city, consistent with the parameters contained in this section; and shall contain the
following endorsement:
This bond may not be canceled, or allowed to lapse, until sixty (60) days after receipt by the City, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a
written notice from the issuer of the bond of intent to cancel or not to renew.
3. Reduction Of Bond: Upon written application by the grantee, the city may, at its sole option, in writing, permit the amount of the bond to be reduced
or waive the requirements for a performance bond. Reductions granted or denied upon application by the grantee shall be without prejudice to the
grantee's subsequent applications or to the city's right to require the full bond at any time thereafter. However, no application shall be made by the
grantee within one year of any prior application.
B. Letter Of Credit:
1. In addition to the performance bond required under subsection A of this section, the grantee may file and maintain with the city an irrevocable letter
of credit from a financial institution licensed to do business in Iowa in the amount of twenty five thousand dollars ($25,000.00), to serve the same
purposes as set forth therein. The form and content of the letter of credit shall be approved by the city.
2. The grantee and its surety shall be jointly and severally liable under the terms of the letter of credit as specified in subsection A of this section.
3. The letter of credit shall provide for thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the city of any intention on the part of the grantee to cancel, fail to renew, or
otherwise materially alter its terms.
4. The letter of credit shall be released only upon expiration of the franchise or upon the replacement of the letter of credit within the time specified
herein.
C. Rights Cumulative: The rights reserved to the city herein are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved herein or authorized by
applicable law, and no action, proceeding, or exercise of a right with respect to such performance bond or letter of credit will affect any other right the
city may have, provided that to the extent that penalties are applied to a grantee under this section, a grantee shall not be subject to liquidated
damages payable to the city for the same violation. Neither the filing of a letter of credit with the city, nor the receipt of any damages recovered by the
city thereunder, shall be construed to excuse faithful performance by the grantee or limit the liability of the grantee under the terms of its franchise for
damages, either to the full amount of the letter of credit or otherwise.
D. Procedures For Remedying Violations:
1. Notice Of Violation: To apply remedies for any failure to comply with this franchise agreement or the ordinance, the city shall notify the grantee in

to the procedures set forth in subsection D2 of this section, or in the event that the alleged default is not remedied within the period specified in
subsection D3 of this section, then the city, if it intends to continue its investigation into the alleged default, shall provide the grantee with a
meaningful opportunity to be heard at a public meeting of the city council, which can be a regularly scheduled council meeting. The city shall provide
the grantee at least ten (10) business days' prior written notice of such meeting, which specifies the time, place and purpose of such meeting and the
consequence that the city seeks to impose, and provides the grantee a meaningful opportunity to be heard.

b. Within three (3) days of a withdrawal from the security fund, the city shall mail, by certified mail, return receipt requested, written notification of the
amount, date, and purpose of such withdrawal to the grantee.
c. If at the time of a withdrawal from the security fund by the city, the amounts available are insufficient to provide the total payment towards which
the withdrawal is directed, the balance of such payment shall continue as the obligation of the grantee to the city until it is paid.
d. No later than thirty (30) days after mailing of notification to the grantee by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a withdrawal under the

part of the grantee.
F. Remedies: The remedies contained herein, except for the limitations specified in subsection F5 of this section, are in addition to any other remedies

shall take the place of any right to obtain actual damages over and above the payment of any amounts otherwise due; and b) to the extent that
penalties are applied to a grantee under the cable ordinance, a grantee shall not be subject to liquidated damages payable to the city for the same
violation.
G. Liquidated Damages: Because the grantee's failure to comply with certain provisions of this agreement or the ordinance will result in injury to the city,
and because it will be difficult to estimate the extent of such injury, the city and the grantee agree to the following liquidated damages for the following
violations of this agreement and the ordinance, which represent both parties' best estimate of the damages resulting from the specified violation. To
maintain that estimate, the parties agree that the liquidated damage amounts are in 2005 dollars and shall be increased each year by the increase in

($250.00) per occurrence.

in the first four (4) years after the effective date (not counting any instances in which the city imposes such liquidated damages or penalties and such
imposition is overturned by a tribunal of competent jurisdiction), then the liquidated damage amounts specified in subsections G1 through G9 of this
section shall be reduced, for the remainder of the franchise term, to half the amounts specified above.

discretion, pursuant to the same procedures, to shorten the remaining term of the franchise agreement to a term not less than 31 months from the
date of the action shortening the franchise term), for the grantee's failure to construct, operate, or maintain the cable system as required by this
agreement; for defrauding or attempting to defraud the city or subscribers; or for any other material breach of this agreement or material violation of
the cable ordinance.
3. If the city revokes the franchise, or if for any other reason the grantee abandons, terminates, or fails to operate or maintain service to its subscribers,
the following procedures and rights are effective:
a. The city may require the former grantee to remove its facilities and equipment at the former grantee's expense and restore affected sites as
required in the cable ordinance, or permit the former grantee to abandon such facilities in place. If the former grantee fails to do so within a
reasonable period of time, the city may have the removal done at the former grantee's and/or surety's expense.

grade or line of such street or public place and so as not to interfere with the conduits, sewers, Municipal public works or utilities, and other mains so
constructed or reconstructed. However, the company shall not be required to relocate pipes, mains and appurtenances when the street, alley or public
grounds, in which they are located, is vacated for the convenience of abutting property owners and not as an incident to a public improvement, unless
the reasonable cost of such relocation and the loss and expense resulting therefrom is first paid to the company by the abutting property owners. In the

or refuse to do and perform the things provided in this chapter, the City may, after reasonable notice, perform the work and charge the reasonable and
necessary expense thereof to the company and the company shall promptly pay said charges.
C. In the event the company is required to move, remove or modify the placement of any of its facilities located within the City because of any public
improvement or public purposes of the City, the company shall do so at its own expenses as directed by the City. In planning for the extension or
modification of streets and roads, the City shall, to the extent practicable in the discretion of its Public Works Director, design such changes to limit the

existing facilities where company facilities are located in private easements (whether titled in the company or other entities) unless said private
easement is upon land owned by the City.
E. If the City orders or requests the company to relocate its existing facilities or equipment for any reason other than as specified above, or as the result of
the initial request of a commercial or other nonpublic development, the company shall receive payment for the cost of such relocation as a precondition
to relocating its existing facilities or equipment.

such substances under the terms and conditions of this franchise.
B. The company shall be allowed to mix other combustible gases with natural gas for distribution within the City as such mixture may be advantageous to
the operation of the company. Such use of mixed gas, however, shall not relieve the company of its obligations under this franchise.

the pavement is completed. All pavement repairs shall be full depth and replaced in full panel sections according to the City excavation policy and
approved by the City Engineer.
B. The City may, in the extension or modification of streets and roads, make provision for the placement of company service lines and facilities on City
owned right-of-way without charge to company. In the event such an area is provided, the company must utilize the area provided for placement of its
service lines and facilities as directed by the City or other reasonable location provided by the company. Nothing in this franchise shall be construed as
a guarantee that in either existing right-of-way or in future acquired right-of-way the City will provide sufficient space for any particular need by the
company nor shall the City be required to obtain additional right-of-way solely for the use of the company. (Ord. 17-18, 5-21-2018)

underground natural gas facilities, to be used for design and planning only. The company shall thereafter update the map or maps every year showing
all subsequent additions or deletions to the distribution system, with GIS compatible maps to the City. However, prior to any excavation by the City or

Federal law on other grounds and agrees to protect the information to the extent allowed by State or Federal law. Furthermore, the City agrees that no

information are exempt from disclosure under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission critical
energy infrastructure requirements pursuant to 18 CFR 388.112 and 388.113, or chapter 22 of the Code of Iowa, as such statutes and regulations may

or her sole discretion that such documents or information is not exempt from disclosure or any action at law, in equity or administrative is brought
against the City regarding disclosure of any document which the company has designated as a trade secret or as otherwise protected from disclosure
the City shall promptly notify the company. The company may take such action as it deems necessary to prevent such disclosure, and in the event the

any street, alley, sidewalk or public place in the City of Dubuque, and which installation, improvement, obstruction or excavation was made or left, in, under

franchise if it has operated in compliance with State or Federal law. A party shall not be considered to have breached this franchise if the alleged breach is
the result of the actions of a third party or the other party. (Ord. 17-18, 5-21-2018)

6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=803 338/716
A. Generally: Connections which are to be used exclusively for supplying water to extinguish fires may be granted upon the conditions set out in this
section.
B. Application: Application for such connection shall be made in writing by the owner of the premises to be served, or the owner's representative, on a form
furnished by the city manager.
C. Drawings To Be Furnished: The applicant must furnish, with the application, a complete and correct drawing or set of drawings, showing the location of
the premises to be supplied, together with location of all valves, pipes, hydrants, tanks, sprinkler heads, and other appurtenances on the premises, the
plans to remain the property of the city. The applicant shall also agree to furnish the city with drawings showing revisions to piping and appurtenances,
whenever the same are made.
D. Installations: The city shall reserve the right to limit the size of fire protection services where the street mains are of such size as to make it necessary to
protect the public interest. If more than one service is installed to the same premises, the piping system of one shall not be connected with the others.
No connection shall be made between the fire service pipe system and the regular water supply of the premises.
E. Use: No water shall be drawn from the fire service pipes for any purpose whatever except for the extinguishment of fires. Valves on outlets, drain cocks,
etc., placed on the pipe system shall be of a style that can be sealed by the city. When any such valve or cock is opened, the owner or occupant of the
premises shall notify the city manager so that the same can be resealed at once. This subsection is not to be construed as prohibiting a reasonable use
of water for fire drills, draining of a system to prevent freezing or other reasonable use in connection with proper fire protection.
F. Connecting City Lines With Private Systems Prohibited; Exceptions: All fire protection systems supplied with water from the city mains shall be supplied
exclusively with such water and no connection shall be allowed with any other system drawing its supply from any other source, unless such
connection is installed and maintained in accordance with the approval of the city manager, and no auxiliary or secondary suction pipe to any fire pump
taking water from any other source will be permitted. Where such connection or duplicate system existed on February 2, 1959, the city manager shall
require the owner of the premises to install a modern double check valve system of the type generally known as the "factory mutual" fire service
connection. Should the owner neglect or refuse to make the required changes within ten (10) days, the city supply shall be shut off.
G. Inspection: All fire services shall be subject to inspection by an authorized inspector of the city, who will visit all premises having fire services from time
to time, and the owners or tenants shall give the inspector all reasonable facilities for making the inspection and any information concerning the same
that may be required. Care will always be taken that inspections will be made with as little inconvenience to the owners or occupants as possible.
H. Penalty For Improper Use: In any case where the owner or occupants of any premises are found to be using water from a fire service for other
purposes than fire protection, the water shall be shut off until the user has given the city reasonable assurance that the offense will not be repeated. A
reconnection charge, as established by the city manager, after official publication, will be imposed and collected prior to restoring service. A second
violation will be sufficient cause for terminating service to the property and refusing reconnection while the offender owns or occupies the premises.
I. Meters: The city reserves the right at any time to require the owner of the premises supplied to furnish and install, at the owner's expense and under the
direction of the city manager, an approved water meter and to keep same in accurate operating condition. (2007 Code § 44-135)

D. Time Limit For Completion After Notice: The resolution passed by the council pursuant to subsection A of this section and the notice that is served upon
the property owner shall prescribe the time within which connections are to be made with such mains as provided for in such resolution, and this notice

3. If a delinquency exists for a rental property in excess of sixty (60) days, the owner must assume responsibility for the future billings to such account.
D. Lien For Nonpayment:
1. The city will have a lien upon the real property served by the city's water system for all delinquent charges. It is the duty of the finance director-city
treasurer to certify such delinquent charges, plus the costs of administration, to the county treasurer and all such delinquent charges and costs will
then constitute a lien against said property and be collected with and in the same manner as general property taxes on said property.

the billing date, the city will send a notice of pending lien to the account holder in whose name the delinquent charges were incurred. The notice must
be sent at least thirty (30) days prior to certification of the lien to the county to such persons by ordinary mail to their last known addresses as
reflected in the computer database account records of the city or in the county auditor's real estate computer data file. The notice must include the
delinquent charge(s) and must indicate that if payment of the total amount is not made by a certain date (corresponding to the sixtieth day after the
billing date for the delinquent account), the delinquent charge(s) will be certified to the county as a lien against the property or premises owned or
rented by the account holder in whose name the delinquent charges were incurred.
4. For all final water service accounts, if full payment of all charges billed, including late payment charges, is not received within thirty (30) days after
the billing date, the city will send a notice of pending lien to the account holder in whose name the delinquent charges were incurred. The notice must
be sent at least thirty (30) days prior to certification of the lien to the county to such persons by ordinary mail to their last known addresses as
reflected in the computer database account records of the city or in the county auditor's real estate computer data file. The notice must indicate that if
payment of the total amount is not made by a certain date (corresponding to the sixtieth day after the billing date for that delinquent account), the
delinquent charge or charges will be certified to the county as a lien against the property or premises owned or rented by the account holder in
whose name the delinquent account charges were incurred.
5. If full payment of all charges billed in an active water service account billing statement, including late payment charges, is not received within sixty
(60) days after the billing date, the finance director-city treasurer, as the city's billing and collection agent, will prepare an assessment schedule listing
such unpaid charges therein.
If full payment of all charges billed in a final water service account billing statement, including late payment charges, is not received within sixty (60)
days after the billing date, the finance director-city treasurer, as the city's billing and collection agent, will prepare an assessment schedule listing
such unpaid charges therein.
A five dollar ($5.00) administrative processing fee will be charged to each delinquent account at the time it is included in the assessment schedule,
which amount will be separately identified on the assessment schedule and included in the amount being assessed. The finance director-city
treasurer will prepare an assessment schedule at least quarterly, listing all delinquent water service charges, and late payment charges, which
accrued in the prior month or since the last assessment schedule was certified. Each such assessment schedule must also identify each delinquent
charge by name of the account holder in whose name the delinquent rates or charges were incurred, must identify each property for which water
service charge is delinquent, and must show the delinquent charges and the administrative processing fee to be assessed against each such
property owned or rented by the delinquent account holder. The finance director-city treasurer is hereby delegated the authority, on behalf of the city,
to certify and file each such assessment schedule with the county treasurer as provided in the Iowa Code section 384.84.
6. Such lien will be enforced until payment in full of the delinquent charges and the administrative processing fee shown on the assessment schedule is
made at the office of the county treasurer. (Ord. 53-12, 9-17-2012)

industrial user and certified by a qualified professional.
4. Periodic Compliance Reports:
a. Any significant industrial user, including significant noncategorical users, subject to a pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of such
pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the city manager
during the months of January and July, unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the city manager, a semiannual report
indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall
include a record of measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. At the discretion of the city manager and in
consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the city manager may agree to alter the months during
which the above reports are to be submitted. All reports for periodic compliance must be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial
user and certified by a qualified professional.
b. The city manager may impose mass limitations on users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in
other cases where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases, the report required by this section shall include the mass of
pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user. These reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the
discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production and mass, where requested by the city manager, of pollutants
contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable
pretreatment standard. All analysis and sampling shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the administrator pursuant to
section 304(g) of the act and contained in 40 CFR, part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the
administrator. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the administrator. Where 40 CFR, part 136 does not
include a sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the EPA publication, sampling and analytical procedures for screening of industrial effluents for priority pollutants, April
1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the administrator.

H. Record Keeping Requirements: Any user subject to reporting requirements established in this article shall be required to retain for a minimum of three
(3) years, any records of monitoring activities and results and shall make such records available for inspection and copying by the EPA, approval
authority, and control authority (city manager). This period of retention shall be extended during the course of any unresolved litigation regarding the
industrial user or POTW, or when requested by the EPA or approval authority.
I. Monitoring Facilities:
1. The city shall require to be provided and shall operate at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow
measurement of the user's wastewater discharge. The monitoring facility will normally be situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when
such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public right of way and located
such that it will not be obstructed.
2. There shall be ample room in such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility
sampling and measurement equipment shall be operated and maintained by the city at the full expense of the owner. Sampling and data recovery
shall be provided by the city for ultimate use in determining compliance or noncompliance with the program.
3. Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in full accordance with the requirements of
the city manager and all applicable local standards and specifications. Construction of required monitoring facilities shall be completed within one
hundred eighty (180) consecutive calendar days following written notification from the city manager.
J. Inspection And Sampling:
1. The city shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this article is being met and all requirements are being complied
with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is discharged shall allow the city, or their representative, ready access at all reasonable
times to all parts of the premises for the purpose of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying or in the performance of any of their
duties. The city, state and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspection,
compliance monitoring and/or metering operations.
2. Where a user has security in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into the premises, the user shall make
necessary arrangements with the security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city, state and EPA will be
permitted to enter, without delay, for the purpose of performing their specific responsibilities.
K. Pretreatment:
1. Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all federal categorical
pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater
to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities
and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city manager for review and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The
review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce
an effluent acceptable to the city under the provisions of this article. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation
shall be reported to and be acceptable to the city prior to the user's initiation of the changes.
2. All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be made available to officials of the city, state and EPA upon request.
L. Confidential Information:
1. Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from inspections
shall be available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to
the satisfaction of the city that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection
as trade secrets of the user.
2. When requested by a person furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to this article,
the national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit, or the pretreatment program; provided, however, that such portions of the report
shall be available for use by the state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report.
Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR part 403 will not be recognized as confidential
information and will be available to the public without restriction.
M. Publication Of Industrial Users In Significant Noncompliance: The city shall publish at least annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the
municipality, a list of the industrial users which, at any time during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements. The term "significant noncompliance" shall mean:
1. Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined herein as those in which sixty six percent (66%) or more of the wastewater measurements
taken during a six (6) month period exceed the daily maximum limit or average limit for the same pollutant parameter by any amount;
2. Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined herein as those in which thirty three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken for
each pollutant parameter during a six (6) month period equals or exceeds the product of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the
applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD(c), TSS, fats, oils and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
3. Any other discharge violation that the city believes has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass-through
(including endangering the health of city personnel or the general public);
4. Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to the public or to the environment, or resulted in the city's exercise of its
emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
5. Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining final compliance;
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=803 367/716
6. Failure to provide, within thirty (30) days after the due date, any required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, ninety (90) day compliance
reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, and reports on compliance with a compliance schedule;
7. Failure to accurately report noncompliance; and
8. Any other violation or group of violations which the city determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment
program.
N. Wastewater Survey: When required by the city, all industrial users must submit information on the nature and characteristics of their wastewater by a
wastewater survey prior to commencing discharge. The city is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically require industrial
users to update the survey. Failure to complete this survey shall be reasonable grounds for terminating service to the industrial user and shall be
considered a violation of this article.
O. Report Of Changed Conditions: Each industrial user is required to promptly notify the city in advance of any planned significant changes to the
industrial user's operation or system which might alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater.
1. The city may require the industrial user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the
submission of a wastewater discharge permit application.
2. The city may issue a wastewater permit or modify an existing permit.
3. No industrial user shall implement the planned changed condition(s) until and unless the city has responded to the industrial user's notice.
4. For purposes of this requirement, flow increases of ten percent (10%) or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants, shall be
deemed significant.
P. Notification Of Discharge Of Hazardous Waste:
1. Any industrial user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director,
and the state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a
hazardous waste under 40 CFR part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR part 261, the EPA
hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more than ten (10) kilograms of
such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and
readily available to the industrial user: a) an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the waste; b) an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents contained in the waste stream discharged during the calendar month; and c) an estimation of the mass of
constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All notifications must take place no later than
one hundred eighty (180) days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each
hazardous waste discharged. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring
requirements.
2. Discharges are exempt from the requirements of subsection P1 of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen
(15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of
more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40
CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such
quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
3. In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional
substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and the
state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations.
4. In the case of any notification made under this section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. (2007 Code § 44-104)

required in this section with the historic preservation commission at the office of the planning services department by the application deadline
established by the commission. If the application is for any building with one or more dwelling units, the planning services department shall provide the
filed information to the housing and community development department.
At its next regular meeting, the commission shall recommend to the city council approval or denial of the application, or table the application for
additional information for a specified period not to exceed sixty (60) days from the date of application with the commission. A failure of the commission
to take action on the application within the sixty (60) day period, unless the applicant requests and the commission grants an extension of such time,

all of the information submitted by the housing and community development department, and shall make a determination as to the following:
1. Whether the building proposed for demolition has historic or architectural significance to the community; and
2. Whether denial of the proposed demolition permit would prevent the property owner from earning a reasonable economic return on the property.
If the commission finds that denial of the application would prevent the property owner from earning a reasonable economic return on the property, or
that the building does not have any historical or architectural significance to the community, the commission shall recommend approval of the
application.
If the commission finds that denial of the application would not prevent the property owner from earning a reasonable economic return on the

application.

the application would prevent the state or the political subdivision from accomplishing its governmental functions as follows:

functions, the commission shall recommend approval of the application.
b. If the commission finds that denial of the application would not prevent the state or the political subdivision from accomplishing its governmental

such time as a demolition permit is applied for in a reference conservation district. The city of Dubuque's historic property inventory and any
subsequent official architectural/historical surveys/evaluations and nominations to the National Register of Historic Places prepared for any buildings
located within the neighborhoods described in subsection A of this section also shall be considered as guidelines at such time.
In determining whether a building has historic or architectural significance, the commission and the city council shall consider an application for a
demolition permit in accordance with the standards for review set forth in the secretary of the interior's "standards for identification and evaluation", and
any subsequent revisions of these standards and guidelines by the secretary of the interior. The commission and the city council shall also consider a
determination from the State Historical Society of Iowa as to the potential eligibility for listing of the building proposed for demolition on the National
Register of Historic Places.

any, between the owner of record, the applicant and the person from whom the property was purchased, and the terms of the purchase or proposed
purchase, including financing;

council fails to take action to approve, deny or withhold action on the application within the ninety (90) day period, or such extension as requested by
the applicant, the building official shall issue the permit forthwith.
The city council may withhold action on the application to allow the city council and the commission an opportunity to investigate the historical or
architectural value of the building to the community and to take such action as may be appropriate to encourage its preservation. However, nothing in
this section shall authorize the withholding by the building official of a demolition permit for more than ninety (90) days from the date of application to
the building services department, unless the applicant requests an extension.
At the hearing, the city council shall consider the recommendation of the commission, any information submitted to the commission by the applicant,

submitted by the housing and community development department.
If the city council finds that denial of the application would prevent the property owner from earning a reasonable economic return on the property or

When the building official issues the permit where plans are required, the plans and specifications shall be endorsed in writing or stamped
"APPROVED". Such approved plans and specifications shall not be changed, modified, or altered without authorization from the building official
and all work shall be done in accordance with the approved plans.
The building official may issue a permit for the construction of part of an electrical system before the entire plans and specifications for the whole
system have been submitted or approved, provided adequate information and detailed statements have been filed complying with all pertinent
requirements of this code. The holder of such permit shall proceed at personal risk without assurance that the permit for the entire building,
structure, or building service will be granted.
(b) Retention Of Plans. One set of approved plans and specifications shall be returned to the applicant and shall be kept on the site of the building
work at all times during which the work authorized thereby is in progress. One set of approved plans, specifications, and computations shall be
retained by the building official until final approval of the work.
(c) Validity Of Permit. The issuance of a permit or approval of plans and specifications shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of,
any violation of any of the provisions of this code, or of any other ordinance of the jurisdiction. No permit presuming to give authority to violate or
cancel the provisions of these codes shall be valid.
The issuance of a permit based upon plans, specifications, and other data shall not prevent the building official from thereafter requiring the
correction of errors in said plans, specifications, and other data or from preventing building operations being carried on thereunder when in
violation of this code or of any other ordinances of this jurisdiction.
(d) Expiration. Every permit issued by the building official under the provisions of this code shall expire by limitation and become null and void, if
the building or work authorized by such permit is not commenced within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of such permit, or if the work
authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days following the last inspection of said work.
Before such work can be recommenced, a new permit shall be first obtained so to do, and the fee therefor shall be one-half (1/2) the amount
required for a new permit for such work provided no changes have been made or will be made in the original plans and specifications for such
work; and provided further that such suspension or abandonment has not exceeded one (1) year. In order to renew action on a permit after
expiration, the permittee shall pay a new full permit fee.
Any permittee holding an unexpired permit may apply for an extension of the time within which work may commence under that permit when
unable to commence work within the time required by this section for good and satisfactory reasons. The building official may extend the time for
action by the permittee for a period not exceeding one hundred eighty (180) days upon written request by the permittee showing that
circumstances beyond the control of the permittee have prevented action from being taken. No permit shall be extended more than once.
(e) Suspension Or Revocation. The building official may, in writing, suspend or revoke a permit issued under the provisions of this code whenever
the permit is issued in error or on the basis of incorrect information supplied or in violation of any ordinance or regulation of the jurisdiction.

be charged at the rate established by the city manager.
(c) Expiration Of Plan Review. Applications for which no permit is issued within one hundred eighty (180) days following the date of application
shall expire by limitation and plans and other data submitted for review may thereafter be returned to the applicant or destroyed by the building
official. The building official may extend the time for action by the applicant for a period not exceeding one hundred eighty (180) days upon request
by the applicant showing that circumstances beyond the control of the applicant have prevented action from being taken. No application shall be
extended more than once. In order to renew action on an application after expiration, the applicant shall resubmit plans and pay a new plan review
fee.
(d) Investigation Fees For Work Without A Permit.
(1) Investigation. Whenever any work for which a permit is required by this code has been commenced without first obtaining said permit, a
special investigation shall be made before a permit may be issued for such work.
(2) Fee. An investigation fee, in addition to the permit fee, shall be collected whether or not a permit is then or subsequently issued. The
investigation fee shall be equal to the amount of the permit fee that would be required by this code if a permit were to be issued. The payment of
such investigation fee shall not exempt any person from compliance with all other provisions of either this code nor from any penalty prescribed
by law.
(e) Fee Refunds.
(1) The building official may authorize the refunding of any fee paid hereunder which was erroneously paid or collected.
(2) The building official may authorize the refunding of not more than eighty percent (80%) of the permit fee paid when no work has been done
under a permit issued in accordance with this code.
(3) The building official may authorize the refunding of not more than eighty percent (80%) of the plan review fee paid when an application for a
permit for which a plan review fee has been paid is withdrawn or canceled before any plan reviewing is done.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=803 405/716
The building official shall not authorize the refunding of any fee paid except upon written application filed by the original permittee no later than
one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of fee payment.
82-5. Inspections.
(a) General. All electrical systems and equipment for which a permit is required by this code shall be subject to inspection by the building official.
No portion of any electrical system intended to be concealed shall be concealed until inspected and approved. Neither the building official nor this
jurisdiction shall be liable for expense entailed in the removal or replacement of any material required to allow inspection. When the installation of
an electrical system and equipment is complete an additional and final inspection shall be made. Electrical systems and equipment regulated by
this code shall not be connected to the energy source until authorized by the building official.
(b) Inspection Requests. It shall be the duty of the person doing the work authorized by a permit to notify the building official that such work is
ready for inspection. The building official may require that every request for inspection be filed at least one (1) business day before such inspection
is desired. Such request may be in writing or by telephone at the option of the building official.
It shall be the duty of the person requesting inspections required by this code to provide access to and means for proper inspection of such
work.
(c) Operation Of Electrical Equipment. The requirements of this section shall not be construed to prohibit the operation of any electrical system or
equipment installed to replace existing equipment. The request for inspection of such equipment must have been filed with the building official not
more than forty-eight (48) hours after such replacement work is completed and before any portion of such electrical system is concealed by any
permanent portion of the building.
(d) Other Inspections. In addition to the called inspections required by this code, the building official may make or require other inspections of any
work to ascertain compliance with the provisions of this code and other laws which are enforced by the code enforcement agency.
(e) Re-Inspections. A re-inspection fee may be assessed for each inspection or reinspection when such portion of work for which inspection is
called is not complete or when corrections called for are not made.
This provision is not to be interpreted as requiring re-inspection fees the first time a job is rejected for failure to comply with the requirements of
this code, but as controlling the practice of calling for inspections before the job is ready for such inspection or re-inspection.
Re-inspection fees may be assessed when the approved plans are not readily available to the inspector, for failure to provide access on the date
for which inspection is requested, or for deviating from plans requiring the approval of the building official.
To obtain a re-inspection, the applicant shall file an application therefor in writing upon a form furnished for that purpose and pay the reinspection
fee in accordance with table no. 13-A.
In instances where re-inspection fees have been assessed, no additional inspection of the work will be performed until the required fees have
been paid.
(f) Monthly Maintenance Inspections. In industrial plants where experienced electricians are regularly employed and who have charge of the
electrical work in such plants, a monthly inspection shall be made by the building official of the installation of electric wiring, fixtures, appliances,
work and materials used in connection with the operation of work in said plant. A record shall be kept at such plants covering the preceding month.
This record shall be filed with the building official each month prior to the time set for making regular inspection. Any falsity contained in the reports
required to be filed with the building official shall subject the person, firm, or corporation responsible therefor to the penalties provided in this
article.
82-6. Connection Approval.
(a) Energy Connections. An electrical system or equipment regulated by this code for which a permit is required shall not be connected to a source
of energy or power until approved by the building official.
(b) Temporary Connections. The building official may authorize the temporary connection of the electrical system or equipment to the source of
energy or power for the purpose of testing the equipment or for use under a temporary certificate of occupancy.

(Ord. 4-15, 1-5-2015)
334.10. Uses Permitted.
Type NM, type NMC, and type NMS cables shall be permitted to be used in the following:
(1) One- and two-family dwellings.
This section was revised for the 2011 code to clarify that the requirements for the use of nonmetallic-sheathed cable in garages of one- and twofamily
dwellings apply regardless of whether the garage is attached or detached. The same requirements also apply to detached sheds or
storage buildings associated with one- and two-family dwellings.
(2) Multifamily dwellings, two (2) stories or less in height, permitted to be of types III, IV, and V construction except as prohibited in 334.12.
(3) Other residential or accessory structures, two (2) stories or less in height, permitted to be of types III, IV, and V construction except as
prohibited in 334.12. Cables shall be concealed within walls, floors, or ceilings that provide a thermal barrier of material that has at least a fifteen
(15) minute finish rating as identified in listings of fire-rated assemblies.
(4) Manufactured buildings as defined and regulated in article 545 of the national electrical code. Manufactured buildings must comply with the
provisions of article 545.
A well-established means of codifying fire protection and fire safety requirements is to classify buildings by types of construction, based on
materials used for the structural elements and the degree of fire resistance afforded by each element. The five fundamental construction types
used by the model building codes are type I (fire resistive), type II (noncombustible), type III (combination of combustible and noncombustible),
type IV (heavy timber), and type V (wood frame). Types I and II basically require all structural elements to be noncombustible, whereas types III,
IV, and V allow some or all of the structural elements to be combustible (wood).
The selection of building construction types is regulated by the local building code, based on the occupancy, height, and area of the building. When
a building of a selected height (in feet or stories above grade) and area is permitted to be built of combustible construction (i.e., types III, IV, or V),
the installation of nonmetallic-sheathed cable is permitted. The common areas (corridors) and incidental and subordinate uses (laundry rooms,
lounge rooms, etc.) that serve a multifamily dwelling occupancy are also considered part of the multifamily occupancy, thereby allowing the use of
nonmetallic-sheathed cable in those areas.
If a building is to be of noncombustible construction (i.e., type I or II) by the owner's choice, even though the building code would permit
combustible construction, the building is allowed to be wired with nonmetallic-sheathed cable. In such an instance, nonmetallic-sheathed cable
may be installed in the noncombustible building because the code would have permitted the building to be of combustible construction.
Section 334.10(5), which was previously in 334.10(A)(1), Exception, permits type NM, nonmetallic-sheathed cables to be installed in type I and type
II construction if the cables are within permitted raceways. A raceway is only permitted to be used if it complies with the article for the raceway and its
use does not violate another article in the code.
(A) Type NM. Type NM cable shall be permitted as follows:
(1) For both exposed and concealed work in normally dry locations except as prohibited in 334.10(3).
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=803 409/716
(2) To be installed or fished in air voids in masonry block or tile walls.
(B) Type NMC. Type NMC cable shall be permitted as follows:
(1) For both exposed and concealed work in dry, moist, damp, or corrosive locations, except as prohibited by 334.10(3).
(2) In outside and inside walls of masonry block or tile.
(3) In a shallow chase in masonry, concrete, or adobe protected against nails or screws by a steel plate at least 1.59 mm (1/16 in.) thick and
covered with plaster, adobe, or similar finish.
(C) Type NMS. Type NMS cable shall be permitted as follows:
(1) For both exposed and concealed work in normally dry locations except as prohibited by 334.10(3).
(2) To be installed or fished in air voids in masonry block or tile walls.
(Ord. 3-12, 1-17-2012)
352.12. Uses Not Permitted.

(B) Support Of Luminaries. For the support of luminaries or other equipment not described in 352.10(H).
(C) Physical Damage. Where subject to physical damage unless identified for such use.
(D) Ambient Temperatures. Where subject to ambient temperatures in excess of 50°C (122°F) unless listed otherwise.
(E) Theaters And Similar Locations. In theaters and similar locations, except as provided in 518.4 and 520.5.
(F) Overhead Lines And/Or Wires. Where overhead lines and/or wires attach to PVC.
(G) Roof And/Or Soffit. Where penetrating through a roof and/or soffit.
In addition to the conditions in 352.12(A) through (G), PVC conduits are not permitted to be installed in ducts, plenums, and other air-handling
spaces. See 300.22, which limits the use of materials in ducts, plenums, and other air-handling spaces that may contribute smoke and products of
combustion during a fire.

1. Floor Live Loads:
a. Reductions: Except for storage areas and assembly occupancies, the following floor live loads may be used in all occupancies in lieu of
augmenting the structure to accommodate the required loading specified in the prevailing code:
(1) The live load specified in the prevailing code may be reduced by fifteen percent (15%) for flexure if three (3) or more wood structural members
are spaced less than twenty four inches (24") on center and are joined by a load distributing element. This live load reduction may not be applied
to the supports or if the original design used repetitive allowable stresses.
(2) The reductions specified in the prevailing code for large tributary areas which comply with the prevailing code may be used.
(3) The live load specified in the prevailing code may be reduced by ten percent (10%) if the existing structure provides a two (2) hour fire resistive
rating. This reduction may be applied to steel and concrete systems only.
(4) The permitted reductions specified in subsections E1a(1) through E1a(3) of this section are not to be used cumulatively.
b. Posting: If the actual live load capability is less than the required live load specified in the prevailing code, the actual live capability load shall be
conspicuously posted and no greater load may be imposed upon the building.
2. Test Of Time Standard: The test of time standard may be applied in lieu of meeting the design load requirements for roof dead load, live load and
wind load specified in the prevailing code where no change of loading will occur, provided:
a. The historic building has been determined to support the imposed floor loads; and
b. The building has stood for more than twenty (20) years with no visible signs of deterioration.
F. Use Of Archaic Materials: This section establishes alternative standards that may be used to evaluate the performance of archaic materials and
assemblies in qualified historic buildings.

basis of comparison with similar conventional codified materials or tests or both.
a. Archaic Codes: Whenever possible, allowable stresses and construction requirements shall be assigned on the basis of the code in effect at the
time of construction.
b. Determination: The allowable stresses may be determined as follows:
(1) Wood: Unless wood is laboratory tested, the allowable stress shall not exceed the lowest allowable stress for that particular species and grade.
If the grade and species cannot be determined, the allowable stress for the lowest grade and species may be used.
(2) Masonry: Allowable stresses for masonry may be determined by laboratory results.
(3) Steel: The allowable stresses for steel may be determined using earlier editions of steel design manuals for the period when the steel was
fabricated.
(4) Concrete: The allowable stresses for concrete may be determined using earlier editions of concrete design manuals.
2. Structural Changes: Structural changes to buildings that are restored, altered or repaired may be made with the same materials of which the existing
building or structure was constructed in order to maintain historical integrity.
3. Fire Resistant Properties:
a. Archaic Building: The fire resistance of an archaic building element may be determined from tables on fire ratings of archaic materials and
assemblies recognized by the department and in accordance with the following conditions:
(1) The building element shall be constructed of materials with the same dimensions and properties as indicated in the tables;
(2) The thickness shall be at least equal to, or greater than, that specified in the tables;
(3) All penetrations in the building element, or assembly, for electrical, plumbing and heating, ventilating and air conditioning systems shall be
packed with noncombustible cementitious materials and so fixed that the packing material will not fall out when it loses its water of hydration;
and
(4) Any effect of age, wear and tear shall be repaired so that the building element is sound, and the original thickness of all components is
maintained.
b. Ratings: Fire resistance ratings for a building element may be determined by:
(1) An actual test by an approved testing laboratory as specified in prevailing code;
(2) Typical examples as listed in the prevailing code; or
(3) An approved calculation method that utilizes the principles and theories of heat flow, mechanical properties, deflection, capacity and as outlined
in the prevailing code.
c. New Materials: The fire resistance of any new assembly or materials shall conform to the provisions of the prevailing code. (2007 Code § 11-75)

14-15-3: GEOTHERMAL WELL STANDARDS:
A. Purpose: It is the purpose of this section to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the people of the city of Dubuque by ensuring that
groundwater will not be polluted or contaminated. Because of the serious potential of adverse environmental impacts, this section is intended to prohibit
all open loop geothermal systems. This section allows for closed loop systems subject to the requirements contained in this section for the
construction, reconstruction, repair and destruction of geothermal wells. The construction of geothermal wells must use construction standards
designed to adequately protect the aquifers in each specific geologic setting encountered and in all other criteria, comply with 567 Iowa administrative
code chapter 49. All well services must be performed with an Iowa department of natural resources certified well contractor as required by 567 Iowa
administrative code chapter 82. The certified well contractor must be on site and in direct control of all well services being performed.
B. Permit Required:
1. Prior to the construction of any well, the well contractor must obtain a private water well construction permit from the Dubuque County health
department and a permit from the building services department, and where applicable, an Iowa department of natural resources permit as required
by 567 Iowa administrative code chapter 50-52 and Iowa Code chapter 455B, division III, part 4.
2. No person may dig, bore, drill, replace, modify, repair or destroy a geothermal well or any other excavation that may intersect groundwater without
first applying for and receiving a permit from the building services department.
C. Application Procedure: Applications for permits required by this section must be made on forms provided by the building services department and must
contain all such information as required on the form. The application must be submitted by the property owner, the owner's representative, or the well
contractor and accompanied by the required filing fee. Minor closed loop systems may be authorized by the building official in consultation with the
water department manager and city engineer. An application for a major geothermal system must include an environmental impact analysis prepared
by an engineer licensed in the state of Iowa. Geothermal permits will be reviewed by the city engineer and building official who will then make a
recommendation to the city manager.
D. Site Plan Requirement: A site plan showing the generally proposed location, number of wells, location of loops, including description and MSDS sheets
of the heat transfer fluid, must be submitted with the application. The plan must include the calculated anticipated volume of grout that will be required.
The plan must identify the heat transfer fluid including MSDS sheets. Heat transfer fluids that are toxic as identified by the international plumbing code
under essentially toxic transfer fluids will not be accepted, and fluids must comply with 567 Iowa administrative code section 49.29(5). Geothermal pipe
loops must be of approved material for geothermal installation, must have a fifty (50) year warranty against defect and workmanship, and must be
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=803 482/716
installed with a tracer wire. A base map showing any known operating and/or nonoperating mines is also required with the application. Base maps are
available online by the city engineering department and/or by the Iowa department of natural resources geologists. Construction of a geothermal heat
pump system (GHEX) within close proximity of mineshafts and mine workings has the potential of creating additional hazards to both the structural
integrity of the GHEX system as well as increasing vulnerability to the shallow aquifer.
E. Location Of Geothermal Systems: The site plan must show the property boundaries and easements of record and must detail where the system is
located on the property. Location of all loops must be within the property boundaries of the building lot and not encroach on any recorded easements.
Major systems may not be located within one thousand feet (1,000') of a current city well or water source. Minor systems may not be located within two
hundred feet (200') of a city deep (Jordan/Cambrian-Ordovician) well or within four hundred feet (400') of a city shallow (alluvial aquifer) well. No
geothermal system is allowed to be constructed within a five hundred foot (500') radius of an identified leaking underground storage tank (LUST) site.
F. Permit Fee: A permit fee, established by the city manager, must be submitted with any application required by this section.
G. Permit Suspension And Revocation: The city manager may suspend or revoke any permit issued pursuant to this section whenever the city manager
finds that the permittee has violated any of the provisions of this section or has misrepresented any material fact in the application or any supporting
documents, or where the well or its use may pose a risk to groundwater quality, human health or the environment or should the system fail any of its
mandated testing requirements.
H. Open Loop Systems Prohibited: Open loop systems are prohibited.
I. Testing Of System: Geothermal piping systems must be tested as required by the building services manager prior to operation of the system and every
three (3) years thereafter. All geothermal systems must be pressure checked by a certified contractor not less than every three (3) years from the
certification system date. Results of the tests must be submitted to the building services department.
J. Abandonment Of Geothermal Systems: Abandonment of geothermal systems must be as required in 567 Iowa administrative code section 49.28. The
heat transfer fluid must be removed by a displacement with grout and the loop pipes properly capped or sealed by an approved method. The top of the
borehole must also be uncovered and properly capped or sealed by an approved method.
K. Regulation Conflict: In the event any of the provisions of this section conflict with any state or federal regulation, the state or federal regulation will
control.
L. Compliance: All procedures and methods for construction of geothermal wells must comply with 567 Iowa administrative code chapters 82 and 49 for
nonpublic water supply wells and all applicable regulations of the United States environmental protection agency.
M. Existing Systems: Except for provisions in subsection B2 of this section regarding replacement, modification, repair or destruction, this section does not
apply to systems in existence on the date of the adoption of this chapter. (Ord. 37-15, 6-1-2015)
14-15-4: WATER WELL SUPPLY SYSTEM:
A. Wells Prohibited: Except as provided in subsections 14-15-2C and 14-15-3B of this chapter, no person may construct a well within the corporate limits.
B. Exceptions:
1. The building services department may issue a permit upon such conditions and limitations as appropriate for the construction of a well installed for
the purpose of groundwater monitoring and/or gauging and/or environmental investigation (investigative well).
2. The city manager may issue a special exception permit for the construction of other types of wells if the city manager determines in the city
manager's sole discretion that connection to the public water supply is not economically feasible. The city manager is under no obligation to issue a
special exception permit and the authority to grant a special exception permit includes the authority to place conditions on the installation, use,
operation, and the abandonment of wells, as well as the authority to establish fees for the administration, oversight, and monitoring as the city

M. Implementation Element: This element details the necessary and agreed upon action steps, responsibility, schedule and cost to implement the goals,
objectives and recommendations of the comprehensive plan. The community planning process should serve to assist the city council, city
administration and community leaders in prioritizing implementation. (2007 Code § 36-2)
15-1-3: COMMUNITY PLANNING DEFINED:
"Community planning" is the process by which the community decides what kind of future it wants by establishing a shared vision of the future and then
establishes the policies, goals and management tools (i.e., specific plans, assignments and regulations) to help reach that desired future. The emphasis is
on a process and direction more than on a plan or document. The community planning process is comprehensive in scope, future oriented, highly
participatory and emphasizes consensus decision making. (2007 Code § 36-3)

Chapter 4
NONCONFORMITIES
16-4-0: INTENT:
It is the intent of this title to recognize the legitimate interests of owners of lawful nonconformities by allowing such lawful nonconformities to continue,
subject to the provisions contained herein. At the same time, it is recognized that lawful nonconformities may substantially and adversely affect the orderly
development, maintenance, use and value of other property in the same zoning district, property that is itself subject to the regulations and terms of this
title. In order to secure eventual compliance with the city's comprehensive plan and with the standards of this title, it is therefore necessary to carefully
regulate lawful nonconformities and to prohibit the reestablishment of such nonconformities that have been discontinued. (Ord. 52-09, 10-19-2009)
16-4-1: NONCONFORMITIES GENERALLY:
A. Within the zoning districts established by this title or its subsequent amendment, there exist uses, lots, and structures, which were lawful before this title
was adopted or amended, but which would now be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this title or its subsequent amendment. Such
nonconformities shall hereafter be considered lawful nonconformities.
B. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this title shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which
actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the adoption or amendment of this title and upon which actual building construction has been carried on
diligently.
C. "Actual building construction" is hereby defined to include the placement of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent
manner. (Ord. 52-09, 10-19-2009)
16-4-2: NONCONFORMITY CREATED BY CHANGE IN LAW OR BOUNDARY:
Whenever a use, lot, or structure becomes nonconforming due to a change in this title or the zoning district boundaries, such use, lot, or structure may be
continued in conformance with this chapter. (Ord. 52-09, 10-19-2009)
16-4-3: EFFECT ON NONCONFORMITIES ILLEGAL UNDER PRIOR LAW:
Nothing in this title shall be interpreted as authorization for, or approval of, the continuance of a use, lot, or structure which was in violation of zoning
regulations in effect immediately prior to the effective date hereof or was otherwise illegal. (Ord. 52-09, 10-19-2009)
16-4-4: NONCONFORMING USES:
A. Any lawful nonconforming use of a lot or structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful and provided there is no enlargement,
increase or extension of the use which would result in a greater area of the zoning lot being occupied than was occupied at the time of the adoption of
this title, and that no additional structures or additions to structures existing at the time of the adoption of this title shall be constructed on the same
zoning lot. Further, no such use shall be increased in intensity or moved or relocated in whole or in part to any other portion of the zoning lot on which it
was located at the time of the adoption of this title.
B. A lawful nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of the structure in which it is located, provided said structure or parts thereof were
manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of the adoption of this title.
C. If any lawful nonconforming use of a lot or structure ceases for any reason for a period of more than one year, any subsequent use of such lot or
structure shall conform to the requirements of this title.
D. Whenever a lawful nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, such nonconforming use shall not thereafter be resumed.
E. When a building or structure housing a nonconforming use is damaged by fire, explosion, act of God, or the public enemy to an extent of more than
seventy five percent (75%) of its fair market value, such building or structure shall not be restored unless the use of the same shall thereafter conform
to the uses permitted in the district in which it is located, except that lawful nonconforming residential uses may be resumed. (Ord. 52-09, 10-19-2009)
16-4-5: NONCONFORMING LOTS:
A. Any lot having insufficient area, width or depth for the zoning district in which it is located, lacking frontage on an improved public street or an improved
private street of a planned district, or any combination thereof, shall be considered a lawful nonconforming lot only if it was conforming, lawfully platted,
and filed in the office of the Dubuque County recorder prior to the adoption of this title or if a deed or other instrument in the owner's chain of title
creating or containing a legal description consistent with the current dimensions of such lot was lawfully recorded and filed in the office of the Dubuque
County recorder prior to the adoption of this title.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=803 523/716
B. On any single, lawful nonconforming lot located within a zoning district which permits single-family detached residential dwellings, one such dwelling
may be constructed by right, provided that setbacks (yards), height, lot coverage, and off street parking requirements of the zoning district within which
the parcel is located are complied with, and all appropriate permits are obtained prior to any construction activity. (Ord. 52-09, 10-19-2009)
16-4-6: NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES:
A. Structures that were lawfully constructed prior to the adoption of this title, but which could not be constructed under the terms of this title by reason of
restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, setbacks (yards), location on the lot or other requirements concerning structures, shall hereafter be
considered lawful nonconforming structures. They may continue to exist so long as they remain otherwise lawful, provided that no reconstruction,
enlargement or alteration of said structures shall occur that will increase their nonconformity except as provided herein. However, any lawful
nonconforming structure or portion thereof may be altered to reduce its nonconformity.
B. Alterations conducted by order of the city to comply with building or life safety code provisions shall be permitted.
C. When a lawful nonconforming structure is damaged by fire, explosion, act of God, or the public enemy to an extent of more than seventy five percent
(75%) of its fair market value, such structure shall not be restored except in conformance with the requirements of the district in which it is located.
However, lawful nonconforming structures used solely for residential uses may be reconstructed to their location, size, and external dimensions that
existed at the time of damage. Residential lawful nonconformities may be expanded provided they comply with the schedule of R-2A alternate twofamily
residential district regulations. (Ord. 52-09, 10-19-2009)
16-4-7: NONCONFORMING CHARACTERISTICS OF USE:
Whenever, due to the adoption or amendment of this title, off street parking, paving of parking area, landscaping, screening, and similar site improvements
do not conform to the requirements of this title, the deficiencies shall be considered lawful nonconforming characteristics of such use. Said deficiencies
shall be brought into conformance whenever the use, lot, or structure with which they are associated is expanded by twenty five percent (25%) or more of
building area existing at the time of adoption of this title. (Ord. 52-09, 10-19-2009)

16-5-22: ID INSTITUTIONAL:
A. The city council finds that several factors distinguish institutions from other land use activities. The most significant feature of institutions is their
tendency to function as substantially separate communities within the city. They maintain a large and definable resident population within a more or
less discrete geographical area. Typically, a broad range of essential living services and facilities are provided by the institutions internally for both its
resident and transitory populations. A second common feature of institutions is a primary educational, medical, religious, or charitable purpose. This
distinguishes them from commercial nursing homes, hotels, boarding houses, and similar uses.
B. The ID institutional district is intended to address the particular problems and characteristics of Dubuque's many institutional facilities. It is the intent of
this title that this district shall only be applied to facilities possessing the characteristics of an institutional use set forth in this section 16-5-22.
C. It is further the intent of this title that, because of the very substantial impact institutional uses may have upon the surrounding community, no expansion
of an existing ID district will be permitted except in accordance with the provisions of this section 16-5-22, which requires a conceptual development
plan to be filed and approved prior to institutional reclassification or substantial on premises expansions. (Ord. 52-09, 10-19-2009)

requests shall include information ordinarily submitted with applications as well as any additional information deemed necessary by the board.
C. Appeals: Where it is alleged there is any error in any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative official in the
enforcement of this title, the aggrieved party may appeal such action. The notice of appeal shall be filed with the board and with the official from whom
the appeal is taken and shall set forth the specific reason for the appeal. The official from whom the appeal is taken shall transmit to the board all the
papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
D. Variances: The board may authorize, upon request in specific cases, such variances from the terms of this title that will not be contrary to the public
interest, where owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of the provisions of this title will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances granted
must meet the following applicable standards:
1. No variances shall be granted for any development within the floodway overlay district which would result in any increase in the 100-year level.
Consideration of the effects of any development on flood levels shall be based upon the assumption that an equal degree of development would be
allowed for similarly situated lands.
2. Variances shall only be granted upon: a) a showing of good and sufficient cause, b) a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant, and c) a determination that the granting of the variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, or cause fraud on or victimization of the public.
3. A variance shall only be granted upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
4. In cases where the variance involves a lower level of flood protection for structures than what is ordinarily required by this title, the applicant shall be
notified in writing over the signature of the administrator that: a) the issuance of a variance will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance,
and b) such construction increases risks to life and property.
5. All variances granted shall have the concurrence or approval of the IDNR.
E. Board Decisions: In passing upon requests for conditional uses and variances, the board shall consider all relevant factors specified in other sections of
this title and:
1. The danger to life and property due to increased flood heights or velocities caused by encroachments.
2. The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands or downstream to the injury of others.
3. The proposed water supply and sanitation systems and the ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary conditions.
4. The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
5. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community.
6. The requirements of the facility for a floodplain location.
7. The availability of alternative locations not subject to flooding for the proposed use.
8. The compatibility of the proposed use with existing development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future.
9. The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area.
10. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles.
11. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwater expected at the site.
12. Such other factors which are relevant to the purpose of this title.
F. Conditions Attached To Conditional Uses Or Variances: Upon consideration of the factors listed above, the board may attach such conditions to the
granting of conditional uses and variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose of this title. Such conditions may include, but not necessarily
be limited to:
1. Modification of waste disposal and water supply facilities;
2. Limitation on periods of use and operation;
3. Imposition of operational controls, sureties and deed restrictions;

16-6-6: OTN OLD TOWN NEIGHBORHOOD DISTRICT OVERLAY:
It is recognized that the older areas of Dubuque primarily in the downtown and surrounding neighborhoods require site design standards that respect the
historic context of their development. (Ord. 52-09, 10-19-2009)
16-6-6-1: PURPOSE:
A. The OTN is characterized by older building stock and a mix of densely developed commercial and residential structures built on small lots served by
alleys. The OTN includes Dubuque's historic downtown core, the Central Avenue and Rhomberg Avenue business corridors, older neighborhood
commercial nodes often located on corner lots and a mix of single- and multi-family housing located on separate lots or as upper story apartments.
B. The purpose and intent of the OTN is to conserve the character and integrity of historic building stock in areas of the city where strict application of site
design standards for new commercial and multi-family residential development are difficult to apply due to the dense development patterns of these
older areas. Often, application of such "suburban style" standards may lead to demolition of existing structures or may limit redevelopment of
commercial and multi-family structures or properties in the OTN. (Ord. 52-09, 10-19-2009)
16-6-6-2: OTN BOUNDARY:
The OTN includes the city's locally designated historic districts, conservation districts, and conservation planning areas as defined in chapter 10 of this
title, and those areas included in the city's phased historic/architectural survey/evaluation. (Ord. 52-09, 10-19-2009)
16-6-6-3: OTN DESIGN GUIDELINES:
OTN design guidelines enable property owners to renovate, redevelop or expand their businesses or buildings within a framework compatible to their
neighborhood character and surrounding environs. (Ord. 52-09, 10-19-2009)
16-6-6-4: APPLICABILITY:
This section 16-6-6 shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of the city shown on the official zoning map as being within the OTN old town
neighborhood district overlay. (Ord. 52-09, 10-19-2009)

2. To recommend to the city council, from time to time, as conditions require, amendments, supplements, changes or modifications to the zoning
ordinance but only after a public hearing.
3. To make such surveys, studies, maps, plans or plats of the whole or any portion of the city and of any land outside thereof, which in the opinion of

B. The city council shall have the authority to establish or revise the priorities of the commission. (Ord. 52-09, 10-19-2009)
16-9-3: ORGANIZATION, MEETINGS:
A. The zoning advisory commission shall choose annually, at its first regular meeting of the fiscal year, one of its members to act as chairperson, and
another of its members to act as vice chairperson, to perform all of the duties of the chairperson during the chairperson's absence or disability. The
commission shall adopt such rules and regulations governing its operation and procedure as may be deemed necessary.
B. Meetings of the zoning advisory commission shall be held the first Wednesday of the month or at the call of the chairperson and at such other times as
the commission may determine.
C. Members of the zoning advisory commission shall attend at least two-thirds (2/3) of all regularly scheduled meetings within any twelve (12) month

except as herein provided. (Ord. 52-09, 10-19-2009)
16-9-5: ZONING RECLASSIFICATION:
A. The city council finds that the reclassification of property is a sensitive and important legislative function which, in the interest of maintaining uniform
zoning policies and the integrity of the comprehensive plan, should only be exercised sparingly and under proper conditions. For this reason, and
because the original zoning district boundaries under this title are presumed to be correct and appropriate, it shall hereafter be the policy of the city to
reclassify property only where a clear showing has been made that the original classification was a mistake or that circumstances and conditions
affecting the property in question have so materially changed so as to demand reclassification in the public interest.
B. The reclassification procedures outlined herein should not be confused with, or used in place of, the amendment process or the variance process. Thus,
the council intends that reclassification of property should not be entertained where: 1) an alleged hardship peculiar to the property is claimed, which is
more properly the subject of a variance request; or 2) it is alleged that the provisions themselves as applied to similar properties are unreasonable,
which is more properly the subject of a text amendment proposal. In all cases, the burden shall be upon the person(s) seeking reclassification to
demonstrate that the requested reclassification is more appropriate than the present classification, in light of the characteristics of the property and the
public welfare.
C. Furthermore, it is contemplated under this title that the long range planning advisory commission is, in the first instance, the body responsible for the
formulation and continuing review of the comprehensive plan, as expressed herein, and this commission shall be charged with the duty of periodically
reviewing the policies and provisions of this title in light of its purposes and changing conditions, and proposing on its own initiative such district
reclassifications or code amendments as may be deemed appropriate to secure the public welfare. (Ord. 52-09, 10-19-2009)

of the property which is located within two hundred feet (200') of the exterior boundaries of the property being considered for reclassification, such

D. Review Of Demolition Permits: Upon receiving an application for a demolition permit for any building subject to this section, the building official must
immediately notify the planning services department of such application. If the application is for any building with one or more dwelling units, the
building official must also immediately notify the housing and community development department. The applicant must file the information required in
this section with the historic preservation commission at the office of the planning services department by the application deadline established by the
commission. If the application is for any building with one or more dwelling units, the planning services department must provide the filed information to
the housing and community development department.
1. At its next regular meeting, the commission will approve or deny the application, or table the application for additional information for a specified
period not to exceed ninety (90) days from the date of application with the commission. Failure of the commission to take action on the application
within the ninety (90) day period, unless the applicant requests and the commission grants an extension of such time, constitutes commission
approval thereof.
2. The commission will review all information submitted by the applicant and, if the application is for any building with one or more dwelling units, all
information submitted by the housing and community development department, and make a determination as to the following:
a. Whether the building proposed for demolition has historic or architectural significance to the community; and
b. Whether denial of the proposed demolition permit would prevent the property owner from earning a reasonable economic return on the property.
3. If the commission finds that denial of the application would prevent the property owner from earning a reasonable economic return on the property,
or that the building does not have any historical or architectural significance to the community, the commission will approve the application.
4. If the commission finds that denial of the application would not prevent the property owner from earning a reasonable economic return on the
property, and that the building has historical or architectural significance to the community, the commission will deny the permit application.
5. If the applicant is the state of Iowa or a political subdivision of the state, the city council will also make a determination as to whether the denial of the
application would prevent the state or the political subdivision from accomplishing its governmental functions as follows:
a. If, after weighing the interests and attempting to accommodate all conflicting governmental interests, the city council finds that denial of the
application would prevent the state or the political subdivision from accomplishing its governmental functions, the city council will approve the
application.
b. If, after weighing the interests and attempting to accommodate all conflicting governmental interests, the city council finds that denial of the
application would not prevent the state or the political subdivision from accomplishing its governmental functions, the city council may deny the
application.
6. If the city council denies the application, it will state its findings in writing and shall transmit a copy of such findings to the applicant.
E. Standards For Demolition Review:
1. The report, "Heritage Of Dubuque", dated March 1974, and filed on record on January 27, 1975, is a comprehensive study for the historical
preservation and conservation of the city and one of the guides to be considered at such time as a demolition permit is applied for under this section.
The city of Dubuque's historic property inventory and any subsequent official architectural/historical surveys/evaluations and nominations to the
national register of historic places prepared for any buildings located within the conservation districts described in subsection A of this section are
also guidelines at such time.
2. In determining whether a building has historic or architectural significance, the commission considers an application for a demolition permit in
accordance with the standards for review set forth in the secretary of the interior's "standards for identification and evaluation", and any subsequent
revisions of these standards and guidelines by the secretary of the interior. The commission also considers a determination from the state historical
preservation office as to the potential eligibility for listing of the building proposed for demolition on the national register of historic places.
F. Economic Guidelines And Review Criteria:
1. In determining whether to approve or deny the application, the commission may consider the information set forth in this subsection. The
commission may also investigate strategies which would allow the property owner to earn a reasonable economic return on the property, may solicit
expert testimony, and may require that the applicant make submissions concerning any or all of the following information:
a. A bid from a qualified contractor showing the cost of the proposed demolition.
b. A report from a licensed engineer, architect or contractor with experience in rehabilitation as to the structural integrity of the structure(s) that the
applicant proposes to demolish.
c. The appraised value of the property by a licensed appraiser for the following conditions:
(1) In the property's current condition;
(2) After completion of the proposed demolition;
(3) After rehabilitation of the existing property for continued use by providing sales for the previous six (6) months for at least three (3) comparable
properties. If there are not sales for the previous six (6) months at comparable properties, sales for the previous year at comparable properties
may be used; and
(4) If the property is an income producing property, such valuation must include the rent scheduled and anticipated income after such
rehabilitation, and the same for at least three (3) comparable properties to substantiate the information provided for the property in question.
d. An estimate from an architect, developer, contractor, or appraiser experienced in rehabilitation as to the cost to rehabilitate the building to the point
of which a reasonable use or a reasonable profit can be realized from the property, including, but not limited to, bringing a building up to code so it
can be occupied, not necessarily its "highest and best use", preferred use, or a restoration project.
e. The amount paid for the property, the date of purchase, and the person from whom the property was purchased, a description of the relationship, if
any, if any between the owner of record, the applicant and the person from whom the property was purchased or is being purchased, and the
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=803 626/716
terms of the purchase or proposed purchase, including financing.
f. If the property is income producing, copies of the 1040 schedule E or other appropriate forms and/or schedules filed with the IRS for the previous
two (2) years. Such forms must include operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation deduction and annual cash flow before and after debt
service, if any. Such forms must be signed by the current property owner to certify their authenticity. If such forms/statements are not available,
income statements from a certified public accountant or licensed public accountant on letterhead and signed may be substituted.
g. The name of all mortgagees and the balance of all mortgages or other financing secured by the property and annual debt service, if any, for the
previous two (2) years. Debt service is the amount of principal and interest payments paid annually on the property.
h. All appraisals obtained within the previous two (2) years by the owner or applicant in connection with the purchase, financing and ownership of the
property.
i. Any listing of the property for sale or rent, the price asked and offers received for sale or rent, if any, within the previous five (5) years.
j. The assessed value of the property for the previous two (2) assessment years.
k. The amount of real estate taxes assessed for the previous two (2) assessment years and whether or not they have been paid.
l. The form of ownership or operation of the property, whether sole proprietorship, for profit or not for profit corporation, limited partnership, joint
venture or other.
m. Any other information considered necessary by the commission to determine whether the property yields or may yield a reasonable economic
return to the property owner(s). A "reasonable economic return" is defined as the cost to rehabilitate the building to the point at which a reasonable
use or a reasonable profit can be realized from the property. This may mean bringing a building up to code to the point at which it can be occupied,
not necessarily to its "highest and best use", preferred use or a restoration project.
n. Proof of the applicant's efforts to obtain financing, tax incentives, preservation grants and other incentives to allow the applicant to earn a
reasonable economic return from the property.
o. Documents detailing the applicant's efforts in ongoing maintenance and repair. This may include, but is not limited to, tax statements and/or copies
of invoices.
2. If the application is for any building with one or more dwelling units, the housing and community development department may also make
submissions concerning any or all of the above information, including strategies which would allow the property owner to earn a reasonable
economic return on the property. The commission will consider such information.
G. Guidelines And Review Criteria For Applications By State Or Political Subdivision Of State:
1. In determining whether to approve or deny the application, the commission may consider the information set forth in this subsection and any other
information the commission considers relevant to balancing any conflicting governmental interests.
2. The commission may require that the applicant make submissions concerning the following information for the proposed site and suitable alternative
location(s), including, but not limited to:
a. Fair market value of property.
b. Estimate of the cost of the proposed demolition, including hazardous material removal and remediation.
c. Fair market value of any property owned by the governmental body that could be sold if that site is not chosen for the project.
d. Property tax impact of removing private property from the tax rolls at the proposed location and all alternative locations.
e. Any other factors that contribute to making one location more suitable than others for the proposed use.
f. Any other information appropriate to evaluating how all conflicting governmental interests may be accommodated.
g. The need for the use in question, the effect on neighboring property, and the environmental impact of the proposed use.
H. Action: If the commission fails to take action to approve, deny or withhold action on the application within the ninety (90) day period, or such extension
as requested by the applicant, the building official will issue the permit forthwith. (Ord. 26-14, 3-17-2014; amd. Ord. 40-15, 6-1-2015)
16-10-6: ALTERATION OF LANDMARKS, HISTORIC PROPERTIES AND SITES:
A. No regulated permit or site plan approval for the alteration of landmarks, individually designated historic properties, landmark sites or structures in
historic districts may be issued prior to review and action by the commission unless a determination of no material effect has been made in accordance
with this chapter. (Ord. 52-09, 10-19-2009; amd. Ord. 40-15, 6-1-2015)
B. Nothing in this chapter may be construed to prevent ordinary maintenance or repair of any landmark, landmark site or structure or site within a historic
district where such maintenance or repair does not involve a material change of appearance which necessitates issuance of a regulated permit or site
plan approval.
C. An application for a regulated permit or site plan approval must be made to the appropriate city official. The application must state or the appropriate
city official will determine whether the proposed work or activity is to be done on a landmark, landmark site, individually designated historic property or
on a structure within a historic district.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=803 627/716
D. If the application demonstrates no material effect as recognized by this chapter, then the city planner may issue a determination of no material effect,
which authorizes the proposed work or activity to proceed. If a permit application does not demonstrate compliance with the standards for a
determination of no material effect, then an application must be made for commission review of the proposed work or activity. The application for
commission review will be filed in the planning services department.
E. Unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by the applicant and the commission, the commission will, within sixty (60) days after submittal of a complete
application, review the proposed work or activity to determine whether it complies with the standards specified in this chapter. In the event the
commission does not approve or deny an application within sixty (60) days after submittal of a complete application, such application is deemed
approved by the commission, unless the applicant has consented to an extension of the sixty (60) day period. The commission will issue a certificate of
appropriateness if, after conducting a review of the application, it finds: (Ord. 27-14, 3-17-2014; amd. Ord. 40-15, 6-1-2015)
1. That the property owner or the property owner's representative has established that the proposed work or activity complies with the standards
specified in this chapter and conforms to the purpose and intent of this chapter; and
2. That creating, changing, destroying or affecting the exterior architectural features of the structure, improvement or site upon which the work is to be
done will not have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic, historic or architectural significance and value of either the property itself or of the
neighboring improvements in a district.
3. In reviewing the proposed work or activity, the commission may confer with the applicant or the applicant's authorized representative. The
commission may require submission of such additional drawings, sketches, photographs or other exhibits, as it deems reasonably necessary for
consideration of the application. (Ord. 52-09, 10-19-2009; amd. Ord. 40-15, 6-1-2015)
F. The issuance of a certificate of appropriateness enables the applicant to obtain a regulated permit or site plan approval and to proceed with the
proposed work or activity.
G. If the commission denies the proposed work or activity, it must state its reasons and transmit to the applicant a written record of its denial. The
commission may propose revisions to the applicant's proposal, which, if adopted by the applicant, may cause the commission to reconsider its denial.
The applicant may modify the proposed project and resubmit a modified proposal at any time.
H. The commission will also issue a certificate of appropriateness, if, after conducting a review of preservation alternatives, it finds: (Ord. 27-14, 3-17-
2014; amd. Ord. 40-15, 6-1-2015)
1. That the property owner or the property owner's representative has established that the preservation alternatives for the proposed work or activity
conform to the purpose and intent of this chapter; and

3. Issuance Or Postponement Of Certificate: If the commission, after review of the evidence submitted, finds that denial of the proposed work would
prevent the property owner from earning any reasonable economic return from the property, the commission will:
a. Immediately issue a certificate of economic nonviability; or
b. At its discretion, postpone, for a period not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days, the issuance of a certificate of economic nonviability. During
this time, the commission will investigate strategies for the property owner to earn a reasonable economic return from the property. No regulated
permit will be issued during this time unless a certificate of appropriateness has been secured. If, at the end of the one hundred eighty (180) day
period, the commission, after a public meeting, finds that the property owner still cannot earn any reasonable economic return from the property, it
will issue a certificate of economic nonviability.
4. Denial Of Certificate: If the commission finds, after initial review or after the one hundred eighty (180) day period of postponement, that the property
owner has earned or is able to earn a reasonable economic return from the property, then the commission will deny the application for a certificate of
economic nonviability.
K. The failure of the commission to approve or deny an application for a certificate of appropriateness within sixty (60) days from the date of the filing of the
application for a certificate of appropriateness, unless an extension is agreed upon mutually by the applicant and the commission, constitutes approval,
unless within such sixty (60) days the commission has made a determination of economic nonviability and has suspended its decision regarding a
certificate of economic nonviability pursuant to subsection J3b of this section.
L. The certificate of appropriateness expires and becomes null and void unless the regulated permits are secured within sixty (60) days from the date of its
issuance.

and be completed within such time as the building official determines is reasonable under the circumstances, but not longer than two (2) years after its
issuance. The building official may grant, in writing, one or more extensions of time, for periods not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days each. The
extensions must be requested in writing and justifiable cause for the extension must be demonstrated. (Ord. 27-14, 3-17-2014; amd. Ord. 40-15, 6-1-

economic nonviability was issued is not commenced within one year of its issuance. (Ord. 27-14, 3-17-2014; amd. Ord. 40-15, 6-1-2015)
16-10-7: STANDARDS FOR DESIGN REVIEW:
A. The commission considers each design review on the merits of the individual case, with due deliberation given to each proposed change(s) and its
sympathetic relationship to the specific historic setting, architectural or historic significance, extent of previous alteration, use of original materials and
quality of design of the existing structure or site. Commission approval of a particular type of alteration or activity does not establish a binding
precedent for future commission action, but may constitute an additional factor to be considered in subsequent design reviews involving the same type
of alteration or activity.
B. The "secretary of interior's standards and guidelines for archaeology and historic preservation", the "secretary of interior's standards and guidelines for
the treatment of historic properties", codified as 36 CFR 68, as amended, and the "secretary of the interior's standards for rehabilitation and guidelines
for rehabilitating historic buildings", provide the guidelines by which the commission reviews an application for a certificate of appropriateness or
certificate of economic nonviability, and any subsequent revisions of these standards and guidelines by the secretary of the interior will be adopted by
the commission.

the exterior architectural features of the building or structure, nor shall the proposed work adversely affect the character or special historical,
architectural or aesthetic value of the property and its setting. The proposed work also must conform to such further standards as may be embodied in
the ordinance. (Ord. 44-16, 9-19-2016)

extension of such time, constitutes commission approval thereof. The recommendation of the commission will be transmitted to the city clerk. The
city clerk will promptly transmit the recommendation and the application to the city council for its consideration. In determining whether to recommend
approval or denial of the request, the commission will consider whether the proposed conservation district, or the expansion or alteration of the

nominations to the national register of historic places prepared for any buildings located within the conservation districts described in subsection A of
this section also shall be considered as guidelines at such time.
2. In determining whether a building has historic or architectural significance, the commission shall consider an application for a demolition permit in
accordance with the standards for review set forth in the secretary of the interior's "standards for identification and evaluation", and any subsequent
revisions of these standards and guidelines by the secretary of the interior. The commission shall also consider a determination from the state
historical preservation office as to the potential eligibility for listing of the building proposed for demolition on the national register of historic places.

The city clerk shall promptly transmit the recommendation and the application to the city council for its consideration. In determining whether to
recommend approval or denial of the request, the commission shall consider whether the proposed conservation district, or the expansion or

Conservation subdivision. Development is clustered to optimize open space, preserve natural features, protect environmentally sensitive
areas, and minimize infrastructure demands.
40
Cottage design subdivision. Development reflects traditional neighborhood design, with smaller lots, reduced setbacks, narrower rights of way,
smaller building footprints, alleys and/or clustering.
30
Solar subdivision. Development includes 70 percent "solar lots" that have a minimum north-south dimension of 75 feet and a front line
orientation that is within 30 degrees of the true east-west axis.
30
Complete street design throughout the subdivision. 15
Permeable street pavement throughout the subdivision. 15
The development incorporates walking/bike trails. These trails should be connected to the development and trails outside the development to
the greatest extent possible.
15
Green building code compliance for 100 percent of dwelling units throughout the subdivision. 10
Rain gardens required by covenant for at least 80 percent of lots throughout the subdivision. 10
Green building code compliance for 50 percent of dwelling units throughout the subdivision. 5
Native and regionally appropriate trees and vegetation are preserved or planted which limits turf grass, limits water demand, improves
infiltration or filtration, and enhances the natural environment. Such vegetation is phased so denuded areas are quickly vegetated. Turf grass
should not exceed 30 percent of the landscaped area.
5
No curb and gutter on city streets with appropriate bioswales and sidewalks. The development incorporates detention basins for property on
site stormwater management. Retention basins can be used as an open water amenity feature for on site stormwater management.
5
Parkway/street trees are planted at approximately 35 foot intervals to reduce wind speeds, help stabilize the soil, and improve air quality. 5
Specify the planting of trees on private property to increase site shading and reduce energy needs for houses. Place trees that lose their
leaves in the fall on the south and west sides of the house to provide shade to lower cooling costs. Evergreen trees planted on the north and
west sides protect against winter winds, which can help reduce heating costs.
5
The development implements innovative infiltration or filtration techniques such as rain gardens, bioswales, French drains, etc. 5
Use of any pavement that reduces the heat island effect throughout the subdivision, such as light colored concrete. 5
Other best management practices, as per city planner or city engineer. 5

space. The city may accept the common open space provided:
a. The common open space is accessible to the residents of the city.
b. The city agrees to and has access to maintain the common open space.
10. Individual Ownership: An individual may hold fee title to the land while a nonprofit or other qualified organization holds a conservation easement
use for the common open space. (Ord. 52-09, 10-19-2009)
16-11-11-2: CONSERVATION SUBDIVISION DEVELOPMENT BONUS:
In consideration for setting aside areas determined as environmentally sensitive, public park land, and common open space, a conservation subdivision
shall qualify for a development bonus.
A. Development Yield Analysis: The subdivider shall submit a table showing the maximum number of dwelling units that would be permitted by the
underlying zoning designation, consistent with the minimum lot size, lot widths, setbacks and other provisions of this title and compare it to the number
of dwelling units proposed. Land that is undeveloped because of other laws and ordinances that prohibit development in certain areas (e.g.,
floodplains, wetlands, steep slopes, and drainageways) shall be excluded from the development yield analysis.
B. Development Bonus: The development bonus shall equal the overall development density as determined by the development yield analysis, plus twenty
percent (20%).
C. Smaller Lot Development: To accommodate a qualified development bonus, the subdivider may submit a plat for smaller lot development. Despite the
lot size, yard, and bulk regulations of this title, and any other applicable requirements of the city, the zoning advisory commission and city council may
approve a development bonus for conservation subdivisions with lot area and dimensions less than required by this title, and those lots shall be
buildable, provided that:
1. The purpose of creating the conservation subdivision with smaller than normal lots is to encourage and promote flexibility, economy, and
environmental soundness in layout and design of residential developments only.
2. It is the intent of this section to allow lots that are smaller than normally allowed by this title where all or most of the lots in the conservation
subdivision are of a similar size. It is not the intent of this section to allow the creation of small remnant lots in subdivisions where most lots meet the
requirements stated herein.
3. No lot may be created that is so narrow, has such little area, or that is so irregularly shaped that it would be impractical, as determined by the zoning
advisory commission at the time of the subdivision review, to construct a principal structure on it that:
a. Could be used for purposes that are permissible in that zoning district; and
b. Would satisfy all applicable lot coverage and setback requirements for the zoning district in which the development is located. (Ord. 52-09, 10-19-
2009)
16-11-12: SOLAR SUBDIVISION:
A. Definition: A "solar subdivision" is a development that includes at least seventy percent (70%) "solar lots", which have a minimum north-south
dimension of seventy five feet (75') and a front line orientation that is within thirty degrees (30°) of the true east-west axis.
B. Solar Access: To facilitate solar access, streets in a solar subdivision shall be oriented in an east-west direction to the maximum extent possible or to
within twenty degrees (20°) of such orientation. This requirement shall not apply to preliminary plats approved prior to the effective date hereof,
provided the final plat of the preliminary plat is submitted within six (6) months, or to final plats submitted within six (6) months of the preliminary plat
approval or to portions of the subdivision where the applicant demonstrates that:
1. There are other means of assuring solar access to lots in question, including, but not limited to, cluster development on large parcels or through the
use of building setback or solar access easements.
2. Topographic conditions on or surrounding the land being subdivided make such orientation unreasonable.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=803 640/716
3. The shape and size of the property being subdivided make such orientation unreasonable.
4. Adopted stormwater management plans or policies indicate a different street orientation.
5. Existing or approved future development contiguous to the subject property precludes adequate solar access to the portion in question.
6. Existing street patterns contiguous to the subject property make such orientation unreasonable.
7. Specific adverse environmental impacts would occur on the site if such orientation were achieved.
8. Desirable street circulation patterns require some streets to be in a more north-south direction.
9. The final platting of only a portion of an approved preliminary plat precludes changes in remaining portions of the preliminary plat which are
necessary to provide adequate solar access to the portion in question. (Ord. 52-09, 10-19-2009)

street. The right of way width shall vary with street classification according to the city standards.
3. Dedication of half street right of way is discouraged but may be approved by the commission and city council to serve the public interest. Lots
abutting on such right of way shall be nonbuildable until the remainder of the street is dedicated to the public.
C. Street Classification:
1. Streets shall be classified by the city engineer as arterial, collector, local or alley. The street hierarchy shall be defined by the city engineer based on

K. Complete Streets Policy:
1. General: The city's comprehensive plan supports the development of a comprehensive bike/hike trail system to provide multimodal transportation for
the city. Streets that are designed for only cars limit transportation choices by making walking, bicycling and taking public transportation inconvenient,
unattractive and potentially dangerous. The city currently implements curb ramp, sidewalk, signage and trail projects that support the implementation
of complete street design. The city's complete streets policy will take into account the potential for additional cost associated with the construction of
complete streets and recognizes that not every new public street will be suitable for implementing all aspects of complete street design. Planning
staff will review application of complete street design as part of the major subdivision review process.
2. Complete Street Design Goals:
a. Design and construct new streets in anticipation of increased demand for bicycling, walking and transit facilities.
b. Design and construct new streets that allow for future improvements to accommodate complete street design attributes, such as provision of extra
right of way to accommodate an off street bike trail in the future.
c. New public streets that implement all or some components of complete street design shall utilize standards found in the following design
guidelines:
(1) AASHTO (American Association Of State Highway And Transportation Officials).
(2) SUDAS (statewide urban design and specifications program).
(3) Federal highway administration.
(4) ITE (Institute Of Transportation Engineers).
3. Complete Street Applications:
a. Most collector and arterial streets are constructed/reconstructed by the city of Dubuque and hence application of complete street design criteria
will be handled through the city's internal design and approval process.
b. Local residential streets in most new residential subdivisions will incorporate some complete street design criteria, such as sidewalks on both
sides of the street, curb ramps at intersection corners, etc.
c. Collector streets within new subdivision, in addition to above, may restrict driveway access to side streets to facilitate on street bike trails, could
include wide sidewalks and parkways to facilitate walking. (Ord. 1-12, 1-17-2012)
16-11-16: SIDEWALKS:
A. Sidewalks shall be required on all public street frontages and constructed of concrete or permeable pavement in accordance with the city and ADA
standards.
B. Sidewalks shall be placed five feet (5') behind the curb parallel to the street, unless an exception has been permitted by the city engineer to preserve
topographical or natural features or to provide visual interest, or unless the subdivider shows that an alternative pedestrian system provides safe and
convenient circulation.
C. In planned developments, sidewalks may be located away from the road system to link dwelling units with other dwelling units, the street and on site
activity centers such as parking areas and recreational areas. They may also be required parallel to the street for safety and other reasons.
D. Sidewalk installation shall be the responsibility of the owner of property abutting the public right-of-way. This responsibility shall extend to all
successors, heirs and assignees. Sidewalk installation shall be required when the development of a lot has been completed. All vacant lots shall have
sidewalks installed upon development of eighty percent (80%) of the lots shown on the approved final plat. (Ord. 52-09, 10-19-2009)

chapter, as may be reasonable and within the general purpose and intent of the site plan review and approval provisions of this chapter if the literal
enforcement of one or more provisions of this chapter is impracticable or will exact an undue hardship because of peculiar conditions pertaining to the
land in question. The affirmative vote of at least four (4) commissioners shall be necessary to grant a waiver. The waiver may be granted subject to
such conditions as the commission may establish to ensure the general purpose and intent of the provisions of this chapter are followed. At the
commission meeting, the applicant and all other interested parties shall be presented a reasonable opportunity to present their views. Decisions of the
zoning advisory commission may be appealed to the zoning board of adjustment in the same manner as appeals from a decision of an administrative
officer. (Ord. 52-09, 10-19-2009)
E. Moratorium For Site Plans In The Southwest Arterial Corridor: The city planner may not issue conditional or final approval for any site plan filed for
property in the southwest arterial corridor that lies within the corporate limits of the city of Dubuque, as delineated on drawings on file in the city clerk's
office, from the effective date hereof to July 1, 2016, except where a vested right to the issuance of such approval accrued prior to the effective date
hereof. (Ord. 47-15, 8-3-2015)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city council may approve a proposed site plan upon a determination that the proposed site plan will not negatively
impact the acquisition of right of way along the preferred alignment of the southwest arterial corridor. The city council shall also consider any
recommendation from the southwest arterial technical committee regarding potential negative impacts, if any, that would result from approval of the
proposed site plan and subsequent development of the parcels. (Ord. 7-11, 1-18-2011)

Stormwater management systems shall be designed in accordance with the requirements of title 14, chapter 12 of this code, as amended. The site,
including parking lots, shall be developed using two (2) or more of the following low impact development tools or other best management practices
approved by the city engineer:
A. Reduced Lot Grading: Ground slope reduction outside the immediate perimeter of a building (where foundation drainage is not a concern) to promote
stormwater infiltration or filtration.
B. Check Dams: Where narrow areas and/or excessive grades force the construction of less than ideal steep swales, rock check dams can be added to
slow flows, minimize erosion, and improve infiltration or filtration.
C. French Drains And Soak Away Pits: Rock filled trenches that promote rapid infiltration or filtration.
D. Green Roofs: Vegetated roofs that reduce runoff, improve energy efficiency, and create a green amenity.
E. Microbasins: Small depressions to create longer flow paths or localized depressions to encourage longer standing water periods and infiltration or
filtration.
F. Permeable Pavements: Open graded, permeable asphalt pavement; open cell unit pavers; and porous concrete _ typically used in parking lots and low
traffic areas _ to provide storage space and another infiltration or filtration route for stormwater.
G. Rainwater Harvesting Systems: Cisterns and rain barrels that harvest water from roof drains and downspouts for landscape watering and nonpotable
uses.
H. Sidewalks And Drives Sloped Toward Open Space: A tool to provide water for site vegetation, which slows surface water flow, improving infiltration.
This technique eliminates the need for curbs, gutters, and catch basins, and the open space slows the transport of untreated water and associated
pollutants while reducing construction costs.
I. Bioswales: Vegetated swales with amended soil backfill and underdrains to improve infiltration or filtration.
J. Native Plantings: Use of native plants to reduce the need for irrigation and reduce runoff. Native plants also slow runoff and improve infiltration or
filtration with their deep, fibrous root systems.
K. Open Water Features: To reduce runoff through evapotranspiration, improve habitats, and create attractive community amenities.
L. Rain Gardens: Landscape depressions filled with amended, permeable soil and native, deep rooted, moisture tolerant plants to promote infiltration or
filtration.
M. Swales: Serpentine, vegetated drainageways that convey water slowly and improve infiltration or filtration.
N. Trees And Other Plantings: Landscaping to intercept rainfall, reduce erosion, improve infiltration or filtration, slow runoff, and reduce peak flows.
O. Tree Filters: Systems that divert a portion of parking lot stormwater from gutters into tree planters, where water infiltrates amended soils and surrounds
plant roots.
P. Vegetative Buffers: Bands of native plantings that intercept runoff from developed areas before it reaches detention basins or natural watercourses (for
pretreatment).

which have over one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet of building area, the applicant shall submit building elevations for review by the city. Any
structure existing at the time of adoption of this title which is expanded for retail commercial use to over one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet of
building area and which expansion constitutes an increase of twenty five percent (25%) or more to the building area shall be subject to these design
standards.
In addition to the site design standards set forth herein, big box retail uses shall comply with the following standards:
A. Definitions Of Facades: For purposes of this section, the facades of a building shall be defined as follows:
FACADE: The portion of any exterior elevation on the building extending from grade to the top of the parapet, wall or eaves and extending the entire
length of the building.
FRONT FACADE: The front or principal face of a building, containing the main entrance; any building face, which can be touched by a line drawn
perpendicular to street (public or private).
REAR FACADE: The face of a building extending along the rear of the lot or site, containing employee and service entrances, loading docks, etc.
SIDE FACADE: The face of a building extending from the front facade to the rear facade of the building.
B. Facade Design: The building facades shall be designed in a way that will reduce the massive scale and minimize a uniform and impersonal appearance
of the building, and that will provide visual interest consistent with the community's identity, character, and scale.
1. Facades of one hundred feet (100') or longer shall be broken up with projections or recessions not less than five feet (5') in depth, and in sufficient
number, to reduce the unbroken massing into lengths of forty feet (40') or less along all sides of the building. Projections from the facade can be
used as an alternate approach.
2. The front facade shall include windows, arcades, awnings, projecting canopies, covered walkways, porticoes, or other acceptable features along at
least sixty percent (60%) of the front facade length and over at least twenty five percent (25%) of the front facade area.
3. Except for entrances to the building, any part of the front facade higher than eleven feet (11') shall give the visual exterior appearance of having
more than one floor for each additional eleven feet (11') in height, i.e., a twenty two foot (22') high building shall give the appearance of a two-story
building.
4. Arcades and other weather protection features shall be of sufficient depth and height to provide a light filled and open space along the front facade.
Architectural treatment, similar to that provided to the front facade, shall be provided to the side facades to mitigate any negative view from any
location off site and any public area (e.g., parking lots, walkways, etc.) on site.
5. A landscape buffer of evergreens approved by the city council shall be required along the property line to screen service areas and rear facades
from the adjacent property.
C. Detail Features: The building shall include architectural features that contribute to visual interest at the pedestrian scale and reduce the massive
aesthetic effect by breaking up the building wall, front, and side, with color, texture change, wall offsets, reveals, or projecting ribs.
D. Roofs: The roof design shall provide variations in rooflines, add interest to, and reduce the massive scale of, large buildings. Roofs shall include two (2)
or more roof planes. Parapet walls shall be architecturally treated to avoid a plain, monotonous look.
E. Maximum Parking:
1. The maximum number of off street parking spaces allowed shall be equal to one hundred twenty five percent (125%) of the required minimum
number of spaces.
2. Parking spaces in excess of the maximum number permitted may be allowed, provided:
a. Each parking space provided in excess of the maximum number allowed shall be paved with a permeable paving material approved by the city; or
b. For each parking space provided in excess of the maximum number allowed, three hundred (300) square feet of additional on site green space
shall be provided and maintained with landscaping; or
c. For each parking space provided in excess of the maximum number allowed, three hundred (300) square feet of green roof shall be provided and
maintained. A "green roof" is herein defined as a roof of a building that is covered with vegetation and soil, or a growing medium, planted over a
waterproofing membrane. It may also include additional layers such as a root barrier and drainage and irrigation systems. Unhealthy or dead
vegetation shall be removed within seven (7) days and replaced with suitable new plant materials at the earliest practical time, but not longer than
nine (9) months, based on the appropriate season.
F. Materials And Color: The building shall have exterior building materials and colors that are aesthetically pleasing and compatible with materials and

6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=803 678/716
A. Every permit issued by the building official under the provisions of this title shall expire by limitation and become null and void if the structure or work

permit fee.
B. Any permittee holding an unexpired permit may apply for an extension of the time within which he may commence work under that permit when he is
unable to commence work within the time required by this section for good and satisfactory reasons. The building official may extend the time for action
by the permittee for a period not exceeding one hundred eighty (180) days upon written request by the permittee showing that circumstances beyond

16-15-7: SIGN CALCULATIONS:
A. On Premises Signs:
1. Single Face: The area of a single face sign shall be measured by calculating the area of each cabinet, module or panel which makes up the sign
face and summing the combined areas to determine the total area. No integral structural element or support, including structural embellishments
such as pole covers, framing or architectural design elements, shall be included in the measurement of sign area; provided, that there is no sign
copy, symbol or other advertising message upon such structural element or support. Such structural element or embellishment shall not exceed the
total square footage allowed for the sign area. Should any sign copy, symbol or other advertising message be located on such structural element or
support, the area enclosed by straight lines drawn closest to the copy extremities encompassing the individual letters, words or symbols shall be
included in the total sign area calculation. The area of a sign composed only of separate letters, words or symbols, without background, shall be the
area enclosed by straight lines drawn closest to the copy extremities encompassing the individual letters, words or symbols.
2. Double Faced: Same as single face except only one face shall be counted for sign area determination.
3. Multiple Faced: Same as single face except that only one face shall be counted for area determination and each face shall be reduced in area by
twenty percent (20%), for each face over two (2).
B. Off Premises Signs:
1. Sign Area: The area of off premises signs shall be measured in the same manner as on premises signs, except that for off premises signs having
"add ons" to the principal sign panel, the sign area of each "add on" shall be calculated separately and added to the principal sign panel. In no case
shall the total sign area of the principal sign panel when added to the sign area of the "add ons" exceed the maximum sign area provided within the
district in which it is located.
2. Sign Number: The number of signs shall be the number of permitted signs displayed on a premises.
3. Single Face: Each structure displaying unified informational content shall be counted as one sign.
4. Double Faced: A double faced sign meeting the same requirements of a single face sign and supported on a single structure shall be counted as
one sign.
5. Multiple Faced: Multiple faced signs, including V-shaped signs, meeting the same requirements of a single face sign and supported on a single
structure shall be counted as one sign.
6. Signs On Multiple Frontage Lots: Zoning lots which have separate frontages on more than one street, including through lots and corner lots, shall not
display signs along any one street frontage in excess of the maximum area and maximum number permitted for that street frontage. Each frontage is
to be considered separately.
7. Painted Wall Signs: Nonstructural signs painted on buildings shall be regulated in size, location, height and number as wall mounted signs.

16-15-14: NONCONFORMING SIGNS:
Any sign which becomes a nonconforming sign on the effective date hereof or which becomes a nonconforming sign at any future date shall be regulated
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=803 711/716
according to the rules set forth in section 16-4-6 of this title, provided that no alteration, improvement or other change, except changes to the sign panel
that do not result in changes to the sign cabinet, may be made to such nonconforming sign that will increase its level of nonconformity. In the event that
such nonconforming sign, or panels or portions thereof shall be removed, for a period exceeding six (6) months, or if the use to which the nonconforming
sign pertains is changed, any replacement sign shall be made to conform to the maximum area, number, allowable structure type, protection, height,
lighting and motion requirements for signs permitted in the zoning district. A nonconforming sign may be altered to reduce its level of nonconformity. (Ord.
52-09, 10-19-2009)
16-15-15: MAINTENANCE:
All signs and sign support structures, together with all of their supports, braces, guys and anchors, shall be kept in repair and in a proper state of
preservation. The display surface of all signs shall be kept neatly painted or posted at all times. (Ord. 52-09, 10-19-2009)
16-15-16: DISCONTINUED OR ABANDONED SIGNS:
Signs which are not properly maintained as determined by the building official or which advertise a use which has been abandoned or discontinued shall
be removed by the property owner within ninety (90) days after abandonment of the principal use or may thereafter be removed by the building official with
such removal expense charged to the property owner. Signs that meet the definition of "painted ghost wall sign" shall not be considered discontinued or
abandoned. (Ord. 52-09, 10-19-2009)
16-15-17: MESSAGE SUBSTITUTION:
A noncommercial message of any type may be substituted for any permitted commercial message or permitted noncommercial message, provided, that
the sign structure is legal without consideration of the sign copy. Such substitution of message may be made without any additional approval or permitting.
This provision prevails over any more specific provision to the contrary within this chapter. The purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent
favoring of commercial speech over noncommercial speech, or favoring of any particular noncommercial message over any other noncommercial
message. This provision does not create a right to increase the total amount of signage on a parcel, nor does it affect the requirement that a sign structure
or mounting device be properly permitted. (Ord. 52-09, 10-19-2009)
16-15-18: PROJECTING SIGNS:
A. Permit Required: No person, firm or corporation shall place and/or maintain any projecting sign over the public right of way without first obtaining a
permit therefor, complying with all applicable local, state and federal regulations, providing acceptable proof of liability insurance and paying the permit
fee, all as provided in this title.
B. Application For Permit: An application for a permit for a projecting sign shall be filed with the building official on a form provided by the building official
not less than seven (7) days prior to the date the projecting sign is to be installed.
C. Permit Fee: The applicant shall pay the permit fee to the city for each projecting sign at the time of the filing of an application for each projecting sign.
D. Hold Harmless: The permit holder shall enter into a hold harmless agreement with the city for any projecting sign prior to issuance of the permit, which
shall require that the permit holder pay on behalf of the city all sums which the city shall be obligated to pay by reason of any liability imposed upon the
city for damages of any kind resulting from the placement or maintenance of a sign, whether sustained by any person or persons, caused by accident
or otherwise, and shall defend at its own expense and on behalf of the city any claim against the city arising out of the placement or maintenance of
said sign.
E. Insurance: Prior to the issuance of a permit for a projecting sign, the applicant shall furnish proof of insurance to the building official as follows:
1. Coverage shall include such comprehensive public liability and property damage insurance written by an insurer licensed to do business in the state
of Iowa as shall protect the city during the life of the projecting sign from claims or damages, personal injury, including accidental death, as well as
claims for property damages, which may arise from the existence of the sign in such a manner as to impose liability on the city, and the amounts of
such insurance shall be as required by the city manager.
2. Such insurance shall name the city as an additional insured.
3. Each owner and/or occupant of the premises required to furnish proof of insurance shall also maintain on file with the building official a certificate
evidencing that the insurer will give the building official thirty (30) days' written notice prior to termination or cancellation of the required insurance.
4. Upon notice of cancellation or termination of insurance, or expiration of proof of insurance, the building official shall notify, by certified mail, the owner
and/or occupant of the premises for which proof of insurance is required that the projecting sign or signs are in violation of this chapter and shall be
removed by the date stated in the notice.
F. Exclusion: The permit holder shall agree in writing prior to the issuance of a permit to the following:
1. The permit holder, by acceptance of a permit, agrees that the permit granted does not constitute approval of the design, construction, repair or
maintenance of any projecting sign.
2. The permit holder, by acceptance of a permit, waives all claims or defenses against the city in the event of claim asserted for death, personal injuries
and/or property damage against the permit holder arising out of or in any way connected with the existence, design, construction, repair or
maintenance of projecting sign or signs for which a permit is issued.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=803 712/716
G. Revocation:
1. A permit granted under this chapter shall be revocable upon ten (10) days' written notice to the permit holder at the convenience of the city. A permit

16-15-20: DESIGN, GENERALLY:
A. General: Signs and sign structures shall be designed and constructed to resist wind as specified in this section. All bracing systems shall be designed
and constructed to transfer lateral forces to the foundations. For signs on buildings the dead and lateral loads shall be transmitted through the structural
frame of the building to the ground in such a manner as not to overstress any of the elements thereof.
B. Overturning: The overturning momentum produced from lateral forces shall in no case exceed two-thirds (2/3) of the dead load resisting moment. Uplift
due to overturning shall be adequately resisted by proper anchorage to the ground or to the structural frame of the building. The weight of earth
superimposed over footings may be used in determining the dead load resisting moment. Such earth shall be carefully placed and thoroughly
compacted.
C. Wind Loads: Signs and sign structures shall be designed and constructed to resist wind forces as specified in the building code.
D. Vertical Load: Vertical design loads, except roof live loads, shall be assumed to be acting simultaneously with the wind or seismic loads.
E. Allowable Stresses: The design of wood, concrete, steel or aluminum members shall conform to the requirements of the building code. Loads, both
vertical and horizontal, exerted on the soil shall not produce stresses exceeding those specified in the building code.
