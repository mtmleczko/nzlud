Section 10. Demolition Delay
Purpose
This By-law is adopted to protect and preserve buildings and structures within Holliston which reflect
or constitute distinctive features of the architectural, cultural, economic, political or social history of
the Town. The intent of the By-law is not to pennanently prevent demolition but rather to provide an
opportunity to develop preservation solutions for prope1iies threatened with demolition.
To achieve these purposes, the Holliston Historical Commission is empowered to advise the
Holliston Building Inspector with respect to the issuance of pennits for demolition, and the issuance
of demolition pennits for significant buildings and structures is regulated as provided in this By-law.
Definitions:
"Building or Structures"- Any combination of building materials giving support or forming a
permanent shelter for persons, animals, or property.
"Business Day''- A day which is not a legal municipal holiday, Saturday or Sunday.
"Commission"- The Holliston Historical Commission.
"Demolition"- The act of substantially or totally pulling down, destroying, removing, or razing a
building or structure, or commencing the work of total or substantial destruction with the intent of
completing the same.
Town General By-laws 20
Town of Holliston
"Historically Significant Building or Structure"- Any building or structure, or portion thereof, within
the Town which is in whole or in pari seventy-five (75) or more years old or is of unknown age and
may be deemed to be significant if the Historical Commission, at a public meeting, finds the building
or structure is significant to the architectural, cultural, political, economic or social history of the
Town.
Procedure
The Building Inspector shall forward a copy of each demolition permit application for a building or
structure to the Commission within five (5) business days of the filing of such application.
Within thirty (30) days from its receipt of a demolition pennit application, the Commission shall
determine whether the building or structure is historically significant. The applicant for the pennit
shall be entitled to make a presentation to the Cormnission if he or she so chooses. If the
Commission determines that the building or structure is not historically significant the Commission
shall so notify the Building Inspector in writing and the Building Inspector may issue a demolition
permit.
If the Cormnission determines that the building or structure is historically significant, the
Commission shall notify the Building Inspector in writing that a demolition review must be made
prior to the issuance of any demolition permit. If the C01mnission fails to notify the Building
Inspector of its detennination within thirty (30) days of its receipt of the application, then the building
or structure shall be deemed not historically significant and the Building Inspector may issue a
demolition pennit.
Demolition Plan Review
Not more than sixty (60) days after the Commission's determination that a building or structure is
historically significant, the applicant for the permit shall submit to the Commission ten (10) copies of
a demolition plan which shall include the following infonnation:
(i) A map showing the location of the building or structure to be demolished on its
property and with reference to neighboring properties;
(ii) Photographs of all street fa9ade elevations
(iii) A description of the building or structure, or part thereof, to be demolished;
(iv) The reason for the proposed demolition and data supporting said reason, including
where applicable, data sufficient to establish any econ01nic justification for
demolition;
(v) A brief description of the proposed reuse of the prope1iy on which the building or
structure to be demolished is located.
Upon receipt of the plan referenced above, the Commission shall fix a reasonable time for a public
hearing on the application and shall give public notice thereof by publishing notice of the time, place
and purpose of the hearing in a local newspaper at least fourteen (14) days before said hearing and
also, within seven (7) days of said hearing, mail a copy of said notice to the applicant and abutters.
The expense of the hearing notice and the mailing to abutters shall be borne by the applicant.
After said public hearing, and within sixty (60) days from receipt of the demolition plan, the
Commission shall file a written report with the Building Inspector on the demolition plan which shall
include the following:
(i) A description of the age, architectural style, historical associations and importance of the
Town General By-laws 21
Town of Holliston
building or structure to be demolished;
(ii) A determination as to whether or not the building or structure should be preferably preserved.
If the building or structure is not determined to be preferably preserved or if the Commission fails to
file its report with the Building Inspector within the time period set forth above, then the Building
Inspector may issue a demolition pennit.
If the Conunission detennines that the building or structure is preferably preserved, it may impose a
demolition delay of six ( 6) months from the date of such dete1mination. Written notice of its
determination and the period of delay imposed shall be mailed promptly to the applicant and/or
property owner, and a copy thereof shall be furnished to the Building Inspector who shall not issue a
demolition permit during the pe1iod specified therein. However, such permit may be issued prior to
the end of such period if the Historical Commission notifies the Building Inspector that the applicant
and/or property owner (i) has made a bona fide, reasonable and unsuccessful effort to locate a
purchaser for the building or structure who has agreed to preserve, rehabilitate, restore or relocate
same, or (ii) has agreed to alternatives to demolition or has agreed to accept a demolition pennit on
specified conditions approved by the Commission.
Responsibilities of the Owner
Once a building or structure has been determined to be a preferably preserved building, the owner
shall be responsible for properly securing the building, if vacant, to the satisfaction of the Building
Inspector. Should the owner fail to secure the building, a subsequent destruction of the building at
any time during the six (6) months demolition delay period, which destruction could have been
prevented by the required secu1ity measures, shall be considered a violation of this By-law.
The Commission shall also notify the Massachusetts Historical Commission, Town Administrator,
Community Preservation Committee and any other interested parties in an effort to obtain assistance
in preservation funding or in finding an adaptive use of the building which will result in its
preservation. The Cmmnission shall invite the owner of record of the building or structure to
participate in an investigation of alternatives to demolition including but not limited to incorporation
of the building into future development of the site, adaptive re-use of the building or structure,
seeking a new owner willing to purchase and preserve, restore or rehabilitate the building or part
thereof, or moving the building.
Emergency Demolition
If the condition of a building or structure poses a seiious and imminent threat to the public health or
safety due to its dete1iorated condition, the owner of such building may request the issuance of an
emergency demolition permit from the Building Inspector. As soon as practicable after the receipt of
such a request, the Building Inspector shall inspect the property with a member of the Commission or
designee. After the inspection of the building or structure, the Building Inspector shall detennine
whether the condition of the building or structure represents a serious and imminent threat to public
health or safety and whether there is any reasonable alternative to immediate demolition of the
building or structure which would protect the public health or safety. If the Building Inspector finds
that the condition of the building or structure poses a serious and imminent threat to public health and
safety, and that there is no reasonable alternative to the immediate demolition thereof, he may issue
an emergency demolition permit to the owner of the building or structure. Whenever the Building
Inspector issues an emergency demolition pennit under this provision he shall prepare a written
repmi describing the condition of the building or structure and the basis for his decision to issue an
Town General By-laws 22
Town of Holliston
emergency demolition permit with the Commission. Nothing in this section shall be inconsistent
with the procedures for the demolition and/or securing of buildings and structures established by
Chapter 14 3, sections 6-10, of the Massachusetts General Laws. In the event that a Board of Survey
is convened under the provisions of section 8 of said Chapter 143 with regard to any building or
structure identified in section 8 of said Chapter 143 with regard to any building or structure identified
as an Historically Significant Building in this By-law, the Building Inspector shall request the
Chairman of the Commission or his designee to accompany the Board of Survey during its
inspection. A copy of the written report prepared as a result of such inspection shall be filed with the
Commission.
Enforcement and Remedies

proceedings, in law or in equity, as they may deem necessary and appropriate to obtain compliance
with the requirements of the By-law or to prevent a tlueatened violation thereof.

are subject to the permit application, or the land and water uses which will result therefrom, are likely
to have a significant individual or cumulative effect on the resource area values protected by this
bylaw. The Commission shall take into account the extent to which the applicant has avoided,
minimized, and mitigated any such effect. The Commission also shall take into account any loss,
degradation, isolation, and replacement or replication of such protected resource areas elsewhere in
the community and the watershed, resulting from past activities, whether pennitted, unpennitted or
exempt, and foreseeable future activities. Due consideration shall be given to any demonstrated
hardship on the applicant by reason of denial, as presented at the public heating.
The Commission shall issue a permit approving the activities which are subject to the permit
application, or the land and water uses which will result therefrom, after it determines that said
activities, or uses which will result therefrom, will not have a significant individual or cumulative
effect on the resource area values protected by this bylaw and comply with the procedures, design
specifications, performance standards, and other requirements in regulations of the Co1mnission. If it
issues a pennit, the Commission shall impose conditions which the Cmmnission deems necessary or
desirable to protect said resource area values, and all activities shall be conducted in accordance with
those conditions. Where no conditions are adequate to protect said resource area values, the
Commission is empowered to deny a pennit for failure to meet the requirements of this bylaw. It may
also deny a permit: for failure to submit necessary information and plans requested by the
Co1mnission; for failure to comply with the procedures, design specifications, perfonnance standards,
and other requirements in regulations of the C01mnission; or for failure to avoid, minimize or
mitigate unacceptable significant or cumulative effects upon the resource area values protected by
this bylaw. The Commission may issue a Determination of Applicability that no further permit
application need be filed with the Commission for a proposed activity within jurisdiction of this
bylaw as long as the activity complies with conditions that the Commission imposes in said
determination.
Town General By-laws 36
Town of Holliston
The Commission within 21 days of the close of the public hearing shall issue or deny a pennit for the
activities requested.
The Commission may waive specifically identified and requested procedures, design specifications,
perfonnance standards, or other requirements set forth in its regulations, provided that: the
Commission finds in writing after said public hearing that there are no reasonable conditions or
alternatives that would allow the proposed activity to proceed in compliance with said regulations;
that avoidance, minimization and mitigation have been employed to the maximum extent feasible;
and that the waiver is necessary to accommodate an overriding public interest or to avoid a decision
that so restricts the use of the prope1ty as to constitute an unconstitutional taking without
compensation.
In reviewing activities within the buffer zone, the Commission shall presume such areas are
important to the protection of other resource areas because activities undertaken in close proximity
have a high likelihood of adverse impact, either immediately, as a consequence of constmction, or
over time, as a consequence of daily operation or existence of the activities. This presumption is
rebuttable and may be overcome by credible evidence from a competent source that such buffer zones
are not impo1tant to protection of other resource areas. These adverse impacts from construction and
use can include, without limitation, erosion, siltation, loss of groundwater recharge, poor water
quality, and loss or degradation of wildlife and wildlife habitat. The Commission may establish, in its
regulations, design specifications, performance standards, and other measures and safeguards,
including setbacks, no-disturb areas, no-build areas, and other work limits for protection of buffer
zones, including without limitation, area strips of continuous, undisturbed vegetative cover. Such
design specifications, perfonnance standards, and other measures and safeguards shall apply unless
the applicant convinces the Commission that the buffer zone area or part of it may be disturbed
without harm to the values protected by the bylaw.
In reviewing activities within the riverfront area, the Commission shall presume the riverfront area is
important to all the resource area values unless demonstrated otherwise, and no permit issued
hereunder shall pennit any activities unless the applicant, in addition to meeting the otherwise
applicable requirements of this bylaw, has proved by a preponderance of the credible evidence that
(1) there is no practicable alternative to the proposed project with less adverse effects, and that (2)
such activities, including proposed mitigation measures, will have no significant adverse impact on
the areas or values protected by this bylaw. The Commission shall regard as practicable an alternative
which is reasonably available and capable of being done after taking into consideration the proposed
property use, overall project purpose (e.g., residential, institutional, commercial, or industrial),
logistics, existing technology, costs of the alternatives, and overall project costs.
To prevent resource area loss, the Commission shall require applicants to avoid alteration wherever
feasible; to minimize alteration; and, where alteration is unavoidable and has been minimized, to
provide full mitigation. The Cmmnission may authorize or require replication of wetlands as a foim
of mitigation but, because of the high likelihood of failure of replication, only with specific plans,
professional design, proper safeguards, adequate security, and professional monitoring and reporting
to assure success.
The Commission may require a wildlife habitat study of the project area, to be paid for by the
applicant, whenever it deems appropriate, regardless of the type of resource area or the amount or
type of alteration proposed. The decision to require a wildlife habitat study shall be based upon the
Commission's estimation of the importance of the habitat area considering (but not limited to) such
Town General By-laws 37
Town of Holliston
factors as proximity to other areas suitable for wildlife, importance of wildlife "corridors" in the area,
or actual or possible presence of rare plant or animal species in the area. The work shall be performed
by an individual who meets or exceeds the minimum qualifications set out in the wildlife habitat
section of the Wetlands Protection Act regulations (310 CMR 10.60) and, when required by the
Commission, has direct professional experience with the wildlife species or wildlife habitat at issue.
The Commission shall presume that all areas meeting the definition of "vernal pools" under IX of
this bylaw, including the adjacent buffer zone area, perfonn essential habitat functions. This
presumption may be overcome only by the presentation of credible evidence which, in the judgment
of the Commission, demonstrates that the basin or depression does not provide essential vernal pool
habitat functions. Any fonnal evaluation should be perfonned by an individual who meets or exceeds
the minimum qualifications under the wildlife habitat section of the Wetlands Protection Act
regulations (310 CMR 10.60) and, when required by the Commission, has direct professional
experience with the wildlife species or wildlife habitat at issue.
A permit, Order of Conditions, ("OOC"), Determination of Applicability ("DOA"), or Order of
Resource Area Delineation ("ORAD") shall expire three years from the date of issuance.
Notwithstanding the above, the Commission in its discretion may issue a pennit expiring five years
from the date of issuance for recurring or continuous maintenance work, provided that annual
notification of time and location of work is given to the Commission. Any pennit may be renewed for
one or more additional one-year periods, provided that a request for a renewal is received in writing
by the Commission thirty (30) days prior to expiration. Notwithstanding the above, a pennit may
identify requirements which shall be enforceable for a stated number of years, indefinitely, or until
pennanent protection is in place, and shall apply to all present and future owners of the land.
For good cause the Commission may revoke any permit, OOC, DOA, or ORAD or any other order,
determination or other decision issued under this bylaw after notice to the holder, the public, abutters,
and town boards, pursuant to V and VI, and after a public hearing.
Amendments to pennits, OOCs, DOAs, or ORADs shall be handled in the manner set out in the
Wetlands Protection Act regulations and policies thereunder.
The Commission may combine the decision issued under this bylaw with the OOC, DOA, ORAD, or
Certificate of Compliance ("COC'') issued under the Wetlands Protection Act and regulations.
No work proposed in any application shall be undertaken until the permit, or ORAD issued by the
Commission with respect to such work has been recorded in the registry of deeds or, if the land
affected is registered land, in the registry section of the land court for the district wherein the land
lies, and until the holder of the pennit certifies in writing to the Commission that the document has
been recorded. If the applicant fails to perform such recording, the Commission may record the
documents itself and require the Applicant to furnish the recording fee therefore, either at the time of
recording or as a condition precedent to the issuance of a COC.
Section 9. Regulations

by an area not less than five feet in width maintained with landscaping except where crossed
by driveways.
Town of Holliston Zoning By-Laws
33
V-C OFF-STREET PARKING CONTINUED
b. Configuration - Dimensions of spaces and aisles shall adequately provide for clearance and
movement. The Planning Board shall adopt and from time to time amend standards for
such dimensions, reflecting current vehicle sizes. At least 10% of the interior of any
parking lot having 40 or more spaces shall be maintained with landscaping, including trees,
in plots of at least four feet in width. Trees and soil plots shall be so located so as to
provide visual relief and sunlight and wind interruption within the parking area, and
designed to assure safe patterns of internal circulation. In the Village Center Commercial
District, the landscaping dimensional requirements may be relaxed at the discretion of the
Building Inspector or the Planning Board.
c. Surface - Off-street parking areas, loading areas, and access drives, if involving six or more
parking spaces, shall be surfaced with bituminous or other paving material unless the
Planning Board, if the provisions of Section VII(2)(b) apply, or Building Inspector
approves an alternative surface which, because of only seasonal or periodic use, will
adequately prevent dust, erosion, water accumulation and unsightly conditions.
d. Lighting - Illumination shall use cut-off luminaires mounted no higher than fifteen feet,
arranged and directed so as to create no glare off-site and to add not more than one footcandle
to illumination levels at any point off-site.
e. Backing - Parking areas having three or more spaces shall be so designed that no vehicle will
be required to back on a public way in order to enter or exit from a parking space.

premises unless each opening centerline is separated from the centerline of all other
driveways serving 20 or more parking spaces, whether on or off the premises, by 150 feet
(measured at the street line). No such opening shall exceed twenty-four (24) feet in width at
the street line unless necessity of greater width is demonstrated by the applicant, and the
opening is designed consistently with Planning Board standards adopted pursuant hereto.
Openings shall be located so as to minimize loss of on-street parking spaces, and shall be
graded and drainage facilities provided where necessary to prevent stormwater from running
across any sidewalk or ponding. No driveway sideline shall be located within twenty (20)
feet of the street line of an intersecting way. All driveways serving five (5) or more parking
spaces shall be constructed with a minimum edge radius of five (5) feet on both sides. All
driveways serving forty (40) or more parking spaces must have not less than 250 feet
visibility in each travel lane entering a state-numbered or maintained highway, and not less
than 150 feet visibility on other streets.
g. Parking Lot Plantings - All plantings shall be of a species characterized by suitability and
hardiness for location in a parking lot. To the extent practical, existing trees shall be
retained and used to satisfy the provisions of this section. Trees and plantings that die
within one year shall be replaced by the owner.

1) Areas to remain as naturally existing woods, fields, meadows, and wetlands shall
be maintained and may be improved in accordance with approval by the Planning
Board.
2) Common open space shall be planned as large, contiguous units wherever
possible. Strips of narrow parcels of common open space are undesirable but may
be permitted when necessary for access or as vegetated buffers along the site's
perimeter.
3) Common open space may be in more than one parcel provided that the size,
shape and location of such parcels are suitable for the designated uses.

V-H OPEN SPACE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT CONTINUED
4) Common open space may be used for passive recreation, conservation, forestry,
agriculture, and natural buffers, subject to approval by the Planning Board.
5) In so far as possible, open space areas shall connect to open space areas on
adjacent properties, regardless of ownership.
6) If detention and/or retention ponds are necessary for the construction of the
improvements shown on the subdivision plan, such detention and/or retention ponds
may be located within the common open space shown on such plan. Such surface
systems shall not qualify towards the minimum open space required.
7) Open space proposed to be restricted for agricultural use shall be permanently
restricted by deed and may include greenhouses, barns or stables and similar
structures for housing poultry or livestock specifically permitted by the Planning
Board for inclusion within said open land, but not residences, garages or other
buildings.
B. There shall be a buffer at the perimeter of the site consisting of trees, shrubs, vegetation
and topographic features sufficient to separate and/or screen the development from
abutting properties. This buffer shall be no less than 1.5 times the required setback or
greater if the property abuts land within Industrial or Commercial zoning districts. Buffer
areas shall remain in their current natural state. If in the opinion of the Planning Board the
current natural state is insufficient to adequately separate and/or screen the site from
abutting properties, additional trees, shrubs and/or plantings shall be required.
Upon a finding by the Planning Board that a buffer of lesser width would be sufficient to
screen and/or separate the development from adjacent property, the buffer may be reduced.
The Board may require no-cut easements, conservation restrictions, or the like where the
buffer requirement has been reduced. These easements and restrictions shall be on private
property and shall not be included in common open space calculations.
8. Common Open Space Ownership and Management
A. Common open space in any ORSD shall be conveyed to:
1) The Town, and may be accepted by it for park or open space use, subject to acceptance
by the Town as required by Massachusetts General Laws; or
2) A nonprofit corporation, the principal purpose of which is the conservation of open
space; or
3) Homeowners corporation or trust.
In any case where such land is not conveyed to the Town, a conservation restriction
prepared in accordance with the provisions of Section 31 and 33, inclusive, of MGL
Chapter 184 enforceable by the Town shall be recorded providing that such land shall be
kept in an open or natural state and shall not be built upon for residential use or developed
for accessory uses such as parking or roadway. Said conservation restriction shall include
appropriate provisions to ensure public access.

policies and objectives for the development of affordable housing in compliance with Hollistons
Affordable Housing Plan, the Holliston Zoning Bylaw, G.L. c. 40B sec. 20-23 and ongoing
programs within the Town to promote a reasonable percentage of housing that is affordable to low
and moderate income buyers. It is intended that the affordable housing units that result from this
Bylaw will be considered as Local Initiative Program (LIP) dwelling units in compliance with the
requirements for the same as specified by the Department of Housing and Community
Development and that said units shall count toward the Towns requirements under G. L. c. 40B
sec. 20-23.
2. Definitions
a. Affordable Housing Unit. A dwelling unit that qualifies as a local initiative unit under the
Commonwealths Local Initiative Program (760 CMR 45.00) and meets the requirements
of a subsidized housing unit for purposes of listing in the subsidized housing inventory
under G. L. c. 40B Sec. 20-23.
b. Qualified affordable housing unit purchaser. An individual or family with a household
income that does not exceed 80% of the Holliston area median income, with adjustments
for household size, as reported by the most recent information from the United Department

Housing and Community Development (DHCD).
3. Applicability
a. Division of Land. This Bylaw shall apply to the division and/or subdivision of land held in
single ownership as of the effective date of this Bylaw, or anytime thereafter, into eight (8)

shall require a special permit from the Planning Board under the provisions for a Cluster
Development (Section V-H) of the Zoning Bylaw unless otherwise exempted below. A
Special Permit shall be required for land divisions pursuant to G. L. c. 40A sec. 9 as well
as for conventional or grid divisions pursuant to G. L.c. 41 sec. 81-L and sec. 81-U,
including those divisions of land that do not require subdivision approval (G.L c.41, s.81-
P).
The Planning Board shall determine whether the proposed project location is suitable for a
Cluster Development under the terms and provisions of this Section and Section V-H. If
the Planning Board determines that the proposed location is suitable for a Cluster
Development, any further subdivision of the land into eight (8) or more lots shall be
accomplished only through the provisions of Section V-H and this Section (V-Q). If the
Planning Board determines, after discussion and analysis, that the location is best suited for

the applicant. The applicant may then proceed to design a conventional subdivision plan
under the provisions of the Subdivision Control Law and the Holliston Subdivision Rules
and Regulations and the provisions of Section V-H shall not apply. In cases where the
Planning Board determines that the project location is not suitable for a Cluster
Development, and where the proposed division of land is for eight (8) or more lots or the
development of eight (8) or more dwelling units on a single lot, the Planning Boards
special permit powers shall be limited to enforcing the provisions of Section V-Q of the
Zoning Bylaw. In either case, however, a Special Permit from the Planning Board shall be

allowed pursuant to the underlying zoning requirements and as calculated pursuant to Section V-H
(g) of the Bylaw but that in no instance shall more than one (1) bonus unit be granted per
additional unit of affordable housing provided by the applicant. Where the Planning Board allows

appraisals of the land in question, as well as data that may be relevant to the determination
of equivalent value.

V-Q INCLUSIONARY HOUSING CONTINUED
11. Preservation of Affordability; Restrictions on Resale - Each affordable unit created in
accordance with this Bylaw shall have the following limitations governing its resale. The purpose
of these limitations is to preserve the long-term affordability of the unit and to ensure its continued
availability to qualified purchasers in the future. The resale controls shall be established through a
deed rider or an affordable housing restriction as defined by G.L. c.184, Section 31, recorded at
the Middlesex County Registry of Deeds, and shall be in force in perpetuity, or for as long a
period as is lawful. The affordable housing use restriction shall meet the requirements of the Local
Initiative Program.
Limitations:
a. Resale price  Sales beyond the initial sale to a qualified affordable income purchaser shall
include the initial discount rate between the sale price and the units appraised value at the
time of resale. This percentage shall be recorded as part of the restriction on the property.
For example, if a unit appraised for $300,000 is sold for $225,000 because of this Bylaw, it
has sold for seventy-five percent (75%) of its appraised value. If, several years later, the
appraised value of the unit at the time of proposed resale is $325,000, the unit may be sold
for no more than $243,750, or seventy -five percent (75%) of the appraised value of
$325,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the resale price of an affordable unit shall in no
event exceed that amount which will require a household earning eighty percent (80%) of
the most recent area median income number, as published by the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development and adjusted for the household size that corresponds
with the number of bedrooms in the affordable unit, to spend a maximum of thirty percent
(30%) of the households annual income on housing costs. Housing costs shall include
principal, interest, property tax, insurance payments and association or condominium fees.
b. Right of first refusal to purchase  The purchaser of an affordable housing unit developed
as a result of this Bylaw shall agree to execute a deed rider prepared by the Town,
granting, among other things, the Towns right of first refusal for a period not less than the
maximum period allowable under guidelines set by the Department of Housing and
Community Development for Local Initiative Units as defined by the Local Initiative
Program, to purchase the property or assignment thereof, in the event that, despite diligent
efforts to sell the property, a subsequent qualified purchaser cannot be located.
c. The Planning Board shall require, as a condition for special permit approval under this
Bylaw that the deeds to the affordable housing units contain a restriction against renting or
leasing of said unit(s) during the period for which the housing unit(s) contains a restriction
on affordability.

V-Q INCLUSIONARY HOUSING CONTINUED
d. The Planning Board shall require, as a condition for special permit approval under this
Bylaw, that the applicant comply with the mandatory set asides of Section 6 of this Bylaw
and accompanying restrictions on affordability, including the execution of a deed rider or
an affordable housing restriction as set forth in Section 11 of this Bylaw. The Building
Commissioner shall not issue an occupancy permit for any affordable unit until the
dwelling units deed rider or affordable housing restriction is recorded at the Middlesex
County Registry of Deeds.
12. Fees in Lieu of Affordable Housing Units - As an alternative to Section 6(a)(i) through (a)(iii),
an applicant may contribute a cash payment to the Holliston Affordable Housing Trust Fund, if
and when said Fund is established pursuant to G.L. c. 44 s.55C, to be used for the development of
affordable housing by the Town or its designees, in lieu of constructing and offering affordable
units within the locus of the proposed development or off-site.
a. Calculation of fees-in-lieu of units. The applicant for development subject to this Bylaw
may pay a fee in lieu of the construction of affordable units. For each affordable unit not
constructed or provided through one or a combination of the methods specified in Section
6 (a)(i) through (a)(iii), the fee shall be an amount equal to the difference between the
median sale price for new single-family homes built in Holliston during the preceding
three (3) fiscal years, as determined and reported by the Board of Assessors, and the
purchase price of a home that is affordable to a qualified purchaser.
(i) For developments other than single family detached structures (e.g. duplexes or multifamily
condominiums), the Planning Board may substitute the median sale price for these
dwelling unit types built in Holliston during the preceding three (3) fiscal years for the
median sale price of new single-family homes.
(ii) The methodology used to determine an affordable purchase price shall comply with
Local Initiative Program guidelines in effect at the time of application for a Special Permit.
(iii) The assumptions used to determine an affordable purchase price, including but not
limited to minimum down payment, mortgage interest rate, term, closing and other costs
shall be consistent with first-time homebuyer mortgage products available from
commercial lending institutions located in or serving Holliston at the time of application
for a special permit, all in accordance with the Inclusionary Housing Submission
Requirements and Procedures Manual adopted by the Planning Board and filed with the
Town Clerk.
(iv) Upon adoption of this Bylaw by Town Meeting, the Planning Board shall prepare and
adopt an Inclusionary Housing Submission Requirements and Procedures Manual after
holding a public hearing on the same.
b. Schedule of fees in lieu of payments. Fees in lieu of payments shall be paid according to
the schedule set forth in Section 7(c), above.

supplied with appropriate plot plans and engineering data to determine compliance. Wind energy
systems shall be allowed to exceed the height limitations of principal structures by up to three times if
a fall zone equivalent to the tower height is provided on-site. They shall be prohibited in the Village

SECTION VIII  TEMPORARY MORATORIUM ON
RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA RETAILERS (Amended October 2018 
STM, Art. 20. Added October 2017  STM, Art. 15.)
VIII-A PURPOSE.
By vote at the State election on November 8, 2016, the voters of the Commonwealth approved a law
entitled the Regulation and Taxation of Marijuana Act, codified in G.L. c. 94G, Regulation of the Use
and Distribution of Marijuana Not Medically Prescribed, as amended by Chapter 351 of the Acts of
2016 and Chapter 55 of the Acts of 2017 (the Act), regulating the control, production and
distribution of marijuana under a system of licenses and regulations. In May 2017, the Town voted
affirmatively, through a local ballot measure, to prohibit Marijuana Retailers in the Town of Holliston.
Thereafter, HB 3818 was enacted, which modified the process to prohibit Marijuana Retailers. The
Town has reviewed its original ballot vote to prohibit Marijuana Retailers and has, as a conservative
measure, drafted a by-law regarding the same. To ensure its enforceability, this bylaw must be ratified
by a second ballot vote which cannot occur until the Annual Town Election occurring in the Spring of
2019. This bylaw, and a companion bylaw allowing other types of Marijuana Establishments,
including Cultivators, Product Manufacturers, and Testing Facilities, is being presented to Town
Meeting concurrently with this moratorium. Consequently, the Town intends to adopt a temporary
moratorium on the use of land and structures in the Town for Marijuana Retailers to permit the Town
to ratify its prohibitive law through a local ballot measure as required by Chapter 94G.
VIII-B DEFINITIONS
1. All terms shall have the meanings set forth in the Act.
VIII-C TEMPORARY MORATORIUM
For the reasons set forth above, and notwithstanding any other provision of the Zoning Bylaw to the
contrary, the Town hereby adopts a temporary moratorium on the use of land or structures for
Marijuana Retailers as defined by the Act, which shall not include Medical Marijuana Treatment
Centers, Marijuana Cultivators, Marijuana Product Manufacturers, or Marijuana Testing Facilities. No
building permit, special permit, variance, site plan or other permit may be issued under this zoning bylaw
for the purpose of establishing a Marijuana Retailer. The moratorium shall remain in effect
through June 15, 2019. During the moratorium period, the Town shall prepare a ballot question for
approval of the voters at the Annual Town election in May, 2019.
NOTE: EFFECTIVE DATE HAS EXPIRED!

of completing the same.
Historically Significant Building or Structure- Any building or structure, or portion thereof,
within the Town which is in whole or in part seventy-five (75) or more years old or is of
unknown age and may be deemed to be significant if the Historical Commission, at a public
meeting, finds the building
or structure is significant to the architectural, cultural, political, economic or social history of the
Town.
Procedure
The Building Inspector shall forward a copy of each demolition permit application for a building
or structure to the Commission within five (5) business days of the filing of such application.
Within thirty (30) days from its receipt of a demolition permit application, the Commission shall
determine whether the building or structure is historically significant. The applicant for the
permit shall be entitled to make a presentation to the Commission if he or she so chooses. If the
Commission determines that the building or structure is not historically significant the
Commission shall so notify the Building Inspector in writing and the Building Inspector may
issue a demolition permit.
If the Commission determines that the building or structure is historically significant, the
Commission shall notify the Building Inspector in writing that a demolition review must be made
prior to the issuance of any demolition permit. If the Commission fails to notify the Building
Inspector of its determination within thirty (30) days of its receipt of the application, then the
building or structure shall be deemed not historically significant and the Building Inspector may
issue a demolition permit.
Demolition Plan Review
Not more than sixty (60) days after the Commissions determination that a building or structure
is historically significant, the applicant for the permit shall submit to the Commission ten (10)
copies of a demolition plan which shall include the following information:
(i) A map showing the location of the building or structure to be demolished on its
property and with reference to neighboring properties;
(ii) Photographs of all street faade elevations
(iii) A description of the building or structure, or part thereof, to be demolished;
(iv) The reason for the proposed demolition and data supporting said reason, including
where applicable, data sufficient to establish any economic justification for
demolition;
(v) A brief description of the proposed reuse of the property on which the building or
structure to be demolished is located.
Upon receipt of the plan referenced above, the Commission shall fix a reasonable time for a
public hearing on the application and shall give public notice thereof by publishing notice of the
time, place and purpose of the hearing in a local newspaper at least fourteen (14) days before
said hearing and also, within seven (7) days of said hearing, mail a copy of said notice to the
applicant and abutters. The expense of the hearing notice and the mailing to abutters shall be
borne by the applicant.
After said public hearing, and within sixty (60) days from receipt of the demolition plan, the
Commission shall file a written report with the Building Inspector on the demolition plan which
shall include the following:
(i) A description of the age, architectural style, historical associations and importance of the
building or structure to be demolished;
(ii) A determination as to whether or not the building or structure should be preferably
preserved.
If the building or structure is not determined to be preferably preserved or if the Commission
fails to file its report with the Building Inspector within the time period set forth above, then the
Building Inspector may issue a demolition permit.
If the Commission determines that the building or structure is preferably preserved, it may
impose a demolition delay of six (6) months from the date of such determination. Written notice
of its determination and the period of delay imposed shall be mailed promptly to the applicant
and/or property owner, and a copy thereof shall be furnished to the Building Inspector who shall
not issue a demolition permit during the period specified therein. However, such permit may be
issued prior to the end of such period if the Historical Commission notifies the Building
Inspector that the applicant and/or property owner (i) has made a bona fide, reasonable and
unsuccessful effort to locate a purchaser for the building or structure who has agreed to preserve,
rehabilitate, restore or relocate same, or (ii) has agreed to alternatives to demolition or has agreed
to accept a demolition permit on specified conditions approved by the Commission.
Responsibilities of the Owner
Once a building or structure has been determined to be a preferably preserved building, the
owner shall be responsible for properly securing the building, if vacant, to the satisfaction of the
Building Inspector. Should the owner fail to secure the building, a subsequent destruction of the
building at any time during the six (6) months demolition delay period, which destruction could
have been prevented by the required security measures, shall be considered a violation of this
By-law.
The Commission shall also notify the Massachusetts Historical Commission, Town
Administrator, Community Preservation Committee and any other interested parties in an effort
to obtain assistance in preservation funding or in finding an adaptive use of the building which
will result in its preservation. The Commission shall invite the owner of record of the building
or structure to participate in an investigation of alternatives to demolition including but not
limited to incorporation of the building into future development of the site, adaptive re-use of the
building or structure, seeking a new owner willing to purchase and preserve, restore or
rehabilitate the building or part thereof, or moving the building.
Emergency Demolition
If the condition of a building or structure poses a serious and imminent threat to the public health
or safety due to its deteriorated condition, the owner of such building may request the issuance of
an emergency demolition permit from the Building Inspector. As soon as practicable after the
receipt of such a request, the Building Inspector shall inspect the property with a member of the
Commission or designee. After the inspection of the building or structure, the Building Inspector
shall determine whether the condition of the building or structure represents a serious and
imminent threat to public health or safety and whether there is any reasonable alternative to
immediate demolition of the building or structure which would protect the public health or
safety. If the Building Inspector finds that the condition of the building or structure poses a
serious and imminent threat to public health and safety, and that there is no reasonable
alternative to the immediate demolition thereof, he may issue an emergency demolition permit to
the owner of the building or structure. Whenever the Building Inspector issues an emergency
demolition permit under this provision he shall prepare a written report describing the condition
of the building or structure and the basis for his decision to issue an emergency demolition
permit with the Commission. Nothing in this section shall be inconsistent with the procedures
for the demolition and/or securing of buildings and structures established by Chapter 143,
sections 6-10, of the Massachusetts General Laws. In the event that a Board of Survey
is convened under the provisions of section 8 of said Chapter 143 with regard to any building or
structure identified in section 8 of said Chapter 143 with regard to any building or structure
identified as an Historically Significant Building in this By-law, the Building Inspector shall
request the Chairman of the Commission or his designee to accompany the Board of Survey
during its inspection. A copy of the written report prepared as a result of such inspection shall be
filed with the Commission.
Enforcement and Remedies
The Commission and/or Building Inspector are each specifically authorized to institute all
actions and proceedings, in law or in equity, as they may deem necessary and appropriate to
obtain compliance with the requirements of the By-law or to prevent a threatened violation
thereof.
No building permit shall be issued with respect to any premises upon which a building or
structure seventy-five (75) years or more old or of undetermined age has been voluntarily
demolished otherwise than pursuant to a demolition permit granted after compliance with the
provisions of this By-law for a period of two (2) years after the date of the completion of such
demolition. As used herein premises refers to the parcel of land upon which the demolished
building or structure was located and all adjoining parcels of land under which the demolished
building or structure was located and all adjoining parcels of land under common ownership or
control.
Any demolition permit issued pursuant to the provisions of this By-law will expire as provided in
the State Building Code.
Severability
In case any section, paragraph, or part of this bylaw is for any reason declared invalid or
unconstitutional by any court of competent jurisdiction, every other section, paragraph and part
shall continue in full force and effect; or take any action relative thereto. (replaced previous
Sec. 11 in its entirety)
