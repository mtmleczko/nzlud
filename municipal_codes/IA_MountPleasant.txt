PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete codification of the ordinances of the City of Mount Pleasant, Iowa, of a general and permanent nature and is the first such codification since 1969. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such ordinances not included herein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
    The source of each section is included in the history note which appears in parentheses at the end thereof. References in history notes to the city's 1969 Code as supplemented through Ordinance number 426, adopted July 18, 1973. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Table appearing in the back of the volume, the reader can locate all laws and ordinances included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been appropriately catchlined to facilitate usage. Appropriate footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which also refer to relevant state laws have been included. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the fourteenth section of Chapter 36 is 36-14. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and, at the same time, new sections, or even whole chapters, can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 5-4 and 5-5 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 5-4.1, 5-4.2, 5-4.3, respectively. New chapters may be included by the addition of a decimal after the chapter number, e.g., if the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13 it will be designated as Chapter 12.1. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of each chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this looseleaf system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Codes with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part thereof, as provided in Section 6 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Index 
    The general index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of George R. Langford, President, and Roger D. Merriam, of the editorial staff, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Mr. Rande A. McAllister, former City Attorney, and Mr. Thomas S. Reavely, City Attorney, and all other city officials for their cooperation and interest during the preparation of this Code. 
    This Code is presented for the use and benefit of the citizens of Mount Pleasant, Iowa.

ARTICLE III. - SOCIAL HOST 

Sec. 3-50. - Purpose; findings. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public interest, welfare, health, and safety within the City of Mount Pleasant by prohibiting the services to and consumption of alcoholic beverages by persons under the age of twenty-one (21) at premises located in the city. The city council finds that the occurrence of social gatherings at premises where alcoholic beverages are served to or consumed by persons under the age of twenty-one (21) is harmful to such persons themselves and a threat to public welfare, health, and safety. The city council further finds that persons under the age of twenty-one (21) often obtain alcoholic beverages at such gatherings and that persons who are in control of such premises know or have reason to know of such service and/or consumption and will be more likely to ensure that alcoholic beverages are neither served or consumed by persons under the age of twenty-one (21) at these gatherings. Based on these findings, the city council has deemed it necessary to enact the following regulations in the City of Mount Pleasant.

The fund shall be known as the "sewer revenue bond and interest debt service fund." The required amount to be deposited in the debt service fund in any month shall be an amount equal to one-sixth ( 1/6 ) of the installment of interest coming due on the next interest payment date on the then outstanding bonds and parity bonds, plus one-twelfth ( 1/12 ) of the installment of principal coming due on such bonds on the next succeeding principal payment date until the full amount of such installment is on hand. If, for any reason, the amount on hand in the debt service fund exceeds the required amount, the excess shall forthwith be withdrawn and paid into the replacement fund. Money in the debt service fund shall be used solely for the purpose of paying principal of and interest on the bonds and parity bonds as the same shall become due and payable. 
(3)  Subordinate obligations. Money in the replacement fund may next be used to pay principal of and interest on (including reasonable reserves therefor) any other obligations which, by their terms, shall be payable from the revenues of the system but subordinate to the bonds and parity bonds, and which have been issued for the purposes of extensions and improvements to the system or to retire the bonds or parity bonds in advance of maturity, or to pay for extraordinary repairs or replacements to the system. 
(4)  Replacement fund. All money thereafter remaining in the replacement fund at the close of each month may be deposited in any of the funds created by this subsection to pay for extraordinary repairs or replacements to the system, or may be used to pay or redeem the bonds or parity bonds, any of them, or for any lawful purpose. 
Money in the replacement fund may next be used to pay principal and interest on (including reasonable reserves therefor) any other obligations which, by their terms, shall be payable from the revenues of the system but subordinate to the bonds and parity bonds, and which have been issued for the purpose of extensions and improvements to the system. 
(c)  Fiscal year-end balances in the operation and maintenance account, the replacement account, and the debt retirement account shall be carried over to the same accounts in the subsequent fiscal year, and shall be used for no other purposes than those designated for these accounts. Monies which have been transferred from other sources to meet temporary shortages in the operation, maintenance and replacement fund shall be returned to their respective accounts upon appropriate adjustment of the user charge rates for operation, maintenance and replacement. The user charge rate(s) shall be adjusted such that the transferred monies will be returned to their respective accounts within the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the monies were borrowed.

(a)  Each user shall pay for the services provided by the city based on his use of the treatment works. Water meter readings will be the normal basis for computing usage. 
(b)  For industrial, commercial and residential contributors, use charges will be based on water used during the current month. If a commercial, industrial or residential contributor has a consumptive use of water or in some other manner uses water which is not returned to the wastewater collection system, the user charge for that contributor may be based upon wastewater meters or separate water meters installed and maintained at the contributor's expense and in a manner acceptable to the city. 
(c)  The minimum charge per month shall be in the amount established in section 25-11(a). In addition, each contributor shall pay a user charge rate for operation and maintenance, including replacement, in the amount established in section 25-11(a), the same to be calculated per one thousand (1,000) gallons of water (or wastewater) as determined in the preceding subsection. 
(d)  For those contributors who contribute wastewater, the strength of which is greater than normal domestic sewage, a surcharge in addition to the normal user charge will be collected. The surcharge for operation and maintenance, including replacement is as follows: 
(1)  Charge per pound BOD as established in section 25-11(a)(2)a. 
(2)  Charge per pound SS as established in section 25-11(a)(2)b. 
(3)  Charge per pound of ammonia nitrogen as established in section 25-11(a)(2)c. 
(e)  Any user which discharges any toxic pollutants which cause an increase in the cost of managing the effluent of the sludge from the city's treatment works, or any user which discharges any substance which singly or by interaction with other substances caused identifiable increases in the cost of operation, maintenance or replacement of the treatment works, shall pay for such increased costs. The charge to each such user shall be as determined by the responsible plant operating personnel and approved by the city council.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Secs. 22-140-22-149. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 2. - DURING WINTER MONTHS 

Sec. 22-150. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this division is to establish this city's policy and level of service in respect to clearance of snow or ice and maintenance of its street and road system during the winter months, as provided in HF 2487, Section 10(2), Acts of the 63rd General Assembly, Second Session, and pursuant to the provisions of Section 309.67, Code of Iowa. This policy and level of service are to be implemented within the amount of money budgeted for this service, and as contained in this city's secondary road budget as submitted to and approved by the Iowa Department of Transportation and adopted by the city council. 
(Ord. No. 647, § 1, 4-3-85) 
Sec. 22-151. - Level of service. 
(a)  Clearance of snow or ice and maintenance of the street and road system during the winter months is primarily for the benefit of the local residents of this city. Each storm has individual characteristics and must be dealt with accordingly. The portion of the roadway improved for travel will have upon it snow and ice in a compacted condition. These conditions may be continuous, or they may be more concentrated on hills, in valleys, curves, and/or intersections. The city's existing snow removal equipment will be utilized for this purpose. All clearance of snow and ice, sanding, salting, and other maintenance respecting winter conditions shall be accomplished within the amount of money budgeted for this service. The entire width of that portion of the road improved for travel may not be cleared of snow, ice, compacted snow and ice, or frost. Snow cleared from that part of the roadway improved for travel shall be placed on or in the adjacent shoulder, ditch, or right-of-way. Snow can be expected to accumulate adjacent to the traveled portion to the extent that a motorist's sight distance to both the left and right may be greatly reduced or impaired. The snow removed from intersections will be piled in its corners in piles of unequal height. The line of sight, sight distance, or visibility of motorists approaching these intersections may be greatly reduced or impaired. The city shall not be responsible for snow pushed or otherwise placed on the roadway or shoulder by others. 
(b)  Motorists shall drive their vehicles during these conditions with additional caution and watchfulness, especially in respect to the surface of the roadway and reduced or impaired visibility, and are advised to reduce their speed at least ten (10) miles per hour below that legally permitted or advised under normal conditions. In respect to roadways that have only one (1) lane open, further extreme watchfulness and caution should be exercised by the motorist, and their speed should not exceed ten (10) miles per hour. 
(c)  During these conditions, no additional warning or regulatory signs will be placed that warn of impaired sight distances, visibility at intersections, road blockages, one-lane conditions, or that the road surface is slick or slippery, or what the advised speed should be. 
(Ord. No. 647, § 2, 4-3-85) 
Sec. 22-152. - Sequence of service. 
(a)  Director of public works. In the implementation of snow and ice removal and other maintenance of the city's street and road system during the winter months, the director of public works or his designee shall select the actual sequence of roads to be cleared as provided for in this section of this division, and shall determine when drifting, wind velocity, and additional snow or snowstorms require that the snow removal equipment be removed from the roadway, or that additional clearance of paved routes be accomplished prior to the clearance of gravel and dirt roads. The director of public works or his designee's professional judgment shall prevail unless it is clearly erroneous. 
(b)  Paved routes. 
(1)  The initial effort will be to get all routes open to one-lane traffic as soon as possible. 
(2)  After one-lane travel is possible, subsequent snow removal will be carried on during normal working hours. 
(3)  The truck-mounted snow plows and spreaders will not normally be in operation between the hours of 4:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. The trucks may be called off the road if snow and/or blowing snow reduces visibility to hazardous working conditions, in the professional judgement of the director of public works or his designee. 
(4)  When required, due to drifting snow, motor graders may be used to keep the paved roads open and the opening of gravel roads may be delayed. 
(5)  It is not the policy of the city to provide a "dry" pavement condition. 
(6)  After roads have been plowed as provided in this section, intersections, hills, and curves may have placed on them salt, sand or other abrasives. These intersections, hills and curves will not be resanded, resalted, or have other abrasives replaced on them between snowstorms. This sequence of service shall be performed only between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. each day, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays observed by city employees. 
(c)  Unpaved roads. 
(1)  The initial effort will be to get all routes opened to one-lane traffic as soon as possible after a storm has passed. 
(2)  After one-lane travel is possible, subsequent snow removal will be carried on during normal working hours. 
(3)  Motor graders and/or truck plows will not normally be in operation between the hours of 4:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. Gravel roads may not be plowed if the wind is causing continual drifting. 
(d)  Private drives and private parking lots. The city will not clear snow from private drives or private parking lots. Normal snow removal operations may result in snow being deposited in private drives or along private parking lots. Snow from sidewalks, private drives or private parking lots shall not be placed on or left remaining on sidewalks, roadways, or shoulders, with the exception that snow accumulating on sidewalks in the following areas may be deposited into the street: 
(1)  Monroe St. between Jackson St. and Adams St. 
(2)  Washington St. between Jackson St. and Adams St. 
(3)  Jefferson St. between Washington St. and Madison St. 
(4)  Main St. between Washington St. and Madison St. 
    There is no time limit after a snowstorm in which any of the above sequence of clearance on paved or unpaved roads shall take place 
(Ord. No. 647, § 3, 4-3-85; Ord. No. 1008, § 1, 2-25-98; Ord. No. 1069, § 1, 1-12-2000; Ord. No. 1078, § 1, 7-26-2000) 
Sec. 22-153. - Limitation of service. 
    The policy and level of service provided for in this division shall not include the performance of the following services: 
(1)  Sanding, salting, or placing of other abrasives upon the roadway that are slick, slippery, and dangerous due to the formation of frost. 
(2)  Sanding, salting, or placing other abrasives upon paved roadway due to freezing precipitation that occurs outside the city's usual working hours. 
(3)  Placing of additional warning or regulatory signs warning of impaired sight distances, visibility at intersections, road blockages, one-lane conditions, or that the road surface is slick or slippery, or what the advised speed should be. 
(Ord. No. 647, § 4, 4-3-85) 
Sec. 22-154. - Emergency conditions. 
(a)  The sequence of service may be suspended during "emergency" conditions. An "emergency" condition shall be considered as one where loss of life is probable, where a serious injury has occurred, or where extensive loss of property is imminent. The condition should be verified through the police department. The city shall respond to all "emergency" conditions either during or after a snowstorm. 
(b)  The provisions of this division shall be further suspended in the event the governor, by proclamation, implements the state disaster plan, or the mayor of the city, by proclamation, implements the city disaster plan. If such occurs, the city personnel and equipment shall be immediately subject to the direction of the governor or the mayor of the city.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 999, §§ 1-24, adopted November 13, 1997, did not specifically amend this Code; hence, its inclusion as §§ 22-171-22-184 was at the editor's discretion. 
Cross reference- Franchises, App. A. 

Sec. 22-171. - Purpose and rule of interpretation. 
    The city council finds it is necessary for the city to establish uniform rules and controls to ensure public safety and provide efficient delivery of services by the city and others wishing to utilize streets and other public property for the delivery of utility or other services, in order to protect public and private investment, ensure orderly use of public administration of the public streets and other public property and secure the rights of the city of a return on its investment in public property. This article is to be interpreted in light of these findings for the benefit of the public and users of the streets and other public property. 
(Ord. No. 999, § 1, 11-13-97) 
Sec. 22-172. - Franchise, license or lease required. 
    No person or other entity shall use the public right-of-way or other public property without first obtaining a franchise, license or lease from the city. A franchise shall be required for carriers who desire to construct, install, operate, maintain or otherwise locate facilities in, under, over or across any public way of the city, and also provide services to persons or areas in the city. A license or lease shall be required for carriers who desire to construct, install, operate, maintain or otherwise locate facilities in, under, over or across any public way of the city for the sole purpose of providing service to persons and areas outside the city. 
(Ord. No. 999, § 2, 11-13-97)

(5)  The location, if any, for interconnection with the facilities of other carriers; 
(6)  The specific trees, structures, improvements, facilities and obstructions, if any, that the applicant proposes to temporarily or permanently remove or relocate; 
(7)  If applicant is proposing to install overhead facilities, evidence that surplus space is available for locating its telecommunications facilities on existing utility poles along the proposed route; 
(8)  If applicant is proposing an underground installation in existing ducts or conduits within the public ways, information in sufficient detail to identify the excess capacity currently available in such ducts or conduits before installation of applicant's telecommunications facilities, and the excess capacity, if any, that will exist in such ducts or conduits after installation of applicant's telecommunications facilities; 
(9)  If applicant is proposing an underground installation within new ducts or conduits to be constructed within the public ways, the location proposed for the new ducts or conduits, and the excess capacity that will exist in such ducts or conduits after installation of applicant's telecommunications facilities. 
(10)  A preliminary construction schedule and completion date; 
(11)  A preliminary traffic control plan in accordance with the IDOT Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices; 
(12)  Any additional information the city may require. 
    All licenses or license or leases required by this section shall be granted by the city council after public hearing as required by Section 364.7. 
    Within one hundred twenty (120) days after receiving a complete application under this section, the city shall issue a written determination granting or denying the application in whole or in part, applying the following standards. If the application is denied, the written determination shall include the reasons for denial. 
(1)  The financial and technical ability of the applicant. 
(2)  The legal ability of the applicant. 
(3)  The capacity of the public ways to accommodate the applicant's proposed facilities. 
(4)  The capacity of the public ways to accommodate additional utility and telecommunications facilities if the license is granted. 
(5)  The damage or disruption, if any, of public or private facilities, improvements, service, travel or landscaping if the license is granted. 
(6)  The public interest in minimizing the cost and disruption of construction within the public ways. 
(7)  The service that applicant will provide to the community and region. 
(8)  The affect, if any, on public health, safety and welfare if the license is granted. 
(9)  The availability of alternate routes and/or locations for the proposed facilities. 
(10)  Such other factors as may demonstrate that the grant to use the public ways will not serve the community interest. 
(Ord. No. 999, § 4, 11-13-97) 
Sec. 22-175. - Fees required. 
    No franchise, license or lease for the use of public right-of-way or other public property shall be granted without requiring the grantee thereof to pay a reasonable and competitively neutral fee for the use of public right-of-way or other public property. 
    The fees will be as follows: All new franchises shall be assessed a franchise fee of up to five (5) percent of the gross receipts of customers within the city limits. Such franchise fees shall be fixed in such a manner that fees are competitively neutral for similar services or industries. A license or lease fee will be assessed on all new license or leases for space in the right-of-way. This license or lease fee is a one-time fee for the term of the license or lease. Payment is expected when the license or lease is signed, however a payment schedule may be entered into between the city and the licensee or leasee. Any payment schedule must require full payment of the fee by the end of the third year of the license or lease. The fee shall be based on a percentage of the estimated value of that portion of the public right-of-way or other public property to be utilized, and is established as follows: The assessed value of the adjacent property shall be determined, such value shall be divided by the number of square feet of the lot to obtain the cost per foot. The city shall assess a license fee in the amount of twenty-five (25) percent of the price per foot. 
    The formulas heretofore described, may be revised by the city authorities, and such revisions shall be applicable to all carriers upon renewal of the franchise, license or lease. 
    In addition to the license or lease fee, an annual right-of-way management fee will be assessed on July 1 of each year that the license or lease is in force. The fee shall reflect the actual management cost the city incurs while managing the right-of-way. The fee is established as follows: five hundred dollars ($500.00) per year. Such fee may be adjusted annually to reflect the increased costs to the city associated with city inspections, city record keeping, city mapping requirements, city insurance requirements, and other related requirements. 
    In addition to the license or lease fee and annual management fee, any person or other entity shall pay a fee every time their facility requires excavation in the right-of-way. This fee will cover costs for street degradation and replacement, inspection, and obstruction and routing of pedestrian and vehicle traffic. The fee schedule is established as follows: seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) per street cut. All or part of this fee may be waived if work is done in conjunction with city construction. Such fee may be adjusted annually to reflect the increased costs associated with excavation in the right-of-way. 
(Ord. No. 999, § 5, 11-13-97) 
Sec. 22-176. - Renewal applications and determinations. 
    If the license or lease is renewed, a new license or lease fee will be assessed. A grantee that desires to renew its license under this article shall, not more than one hundred eighty (180) days nor less than ninety (90) days before expiration of the current license, file an application with the city for renewal of its license which shall include the following information: 
(1)  The information required pursuant to sec. 22-174 of this article. 
(2)  Any information required pursuant to the license agreement between the city and the grantee. 
    Within ninety (90) days after receiving a complete application, the city shall issue a written determination granting or denying the renewal application in whole or in part, applying the following standards. If the renewal application is denied, the written determination shall include the reasons for non-renewal. 
(1)  The financial and technical ability of the applicant. 
(2)  The legal ability of the applicant. 
(3)  The continuing capacity of the public ways to accommodate the applicant's existing facilities. 
(4)  The applicant's compliance with the requirements of this article and the license agreement. 
(5)  Such other factors as may demonstrate that the continued grant to use the public ways will not serve the community interest. 
    No license shall be renewed until any ongoing violations or defaults in the licensee's performance of the license agreement, or of the requirements of this article, have been cured, or a plan detailing the corrective action to be taken by the grantee has been approved by the city. 
(Ord. No. 999, § 6, 11-13-97) 
Sec. 22-177. - Amendment of grant. 
    A new license or lease application and grant shall be required of any carrier that desires to extend or locate its facilities in public ways of the city, which are not included in a license previously granted herein. If ordered by the city to locate or relocate its facilities in public ways not included in a previously granted license, the city shall grant a license amendment, without further application.

Sec. 22-178. - Limit on term. 
    No franchise, license or lease for use of the public right-of-way or other public property shall be granted for a term exceeding ten (10) years.

Sec. 22-179. - Place of facilities. 
    The facilities, fixtures and equipment of the distribution, transmission or sale of any utility services, or services provided under license or lease or easement, shall be placed and maintained so as not to unnecessarily or unreasonably interfere with the travel on the streets, highways, avenues, alleys, bridges and public places in the city, nor shall such facilities, fixtures and equipment interfere with the proper use of the same, including, but not limited to, ordinary drainage, or the function of the sewers, underground pipe or other property of the city. In the event that facilities, fixtures and equipment of any person or other entity located within a public right-of-way must be relocated because of paving, road construction or road reconstruction, sewer construction or sewer reconstruction, or the construction or reconstruction of public drainage systems or similar public works or the construction or reconstruction of the facilities of any city-owned utility, such relocation, at the written request, of the city, shall be completed by the owner of such facilities at the owner's cost. The city shall upon request of any person or other entity holding a franchise, license or lease, review any plans for the construction of facilities, fixtures and equipment within the public right-of-way and advise the person or other entity of any conflict such construction may have with planned or anticipated public improvements, but failure of the city to so advise such person or other entity will not relieve the owner of such facilities of its obligations under this article. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city public works director may require placement of equipment or facilities belonging to any holder of a franchise, license or lease be limited to locations designated by the city public works director to be necessary to protect the integrity of use of present and future users of the public right-of-way or other public property. 
(Ord. No. 999, § 9, 11-13-97) 
Sec. 22-180. - Removal of unauthorized facilities. 
    Within thirty (30) days following written notice from the city, any grantee, telecommunications carrier, or other person that owns, controls or maintains any unauthorized telecommunications system, facility or related appurtenances within the public ways of the city shall, at its own expense, remove such facilities or appurtenances from the public ways of the city. A telecommunications system or facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in the following circumstances: 
(1)  Upon expiration or termination of the grantee's telecommunications license or franchise. 
(2)  Upon abandonment of a facility within the public ways of the city. 
(3)  If the system or facility was constructed or installed without the prior grant of a telecommunications license or franchise. 
(4)  If the system or facility was constructed or installed without the prior issuance of a required construction permit. 
(5)  If the system or facility was constructed or installed at a location not permitted by the grantee's telecommunications license or franchise. 
(Ord. No. 999, § 10, 11-13-97) 
Sec. 22-181. - Indemnification and bond. 
    The holder of any franchise, license or lease shall indemnify and hold the city harmless at all times during the term of the franchise, license or lease from and against all claims for injury or damage to any person or property, including payments under worker's compensation laws, court costs and attorney fees, which are caused by the construction, erection, operation or maintenance of its facilities, fixtures or equipment, or the negligence of its contractors or its employees. In case of any suit or action at law being commenced against the city, upon any claim for damage arising out of any excavation made or left in, under or upon such street, sidewalk, alley or public place by the holder of a franchise, license or lease, its agents, contractors or employees, upon being notified in writing by the city of such action or proceeding, the holder of the franchise, license or lease shall appear and make proper defense thereto at the expense of the holder of the franchise, license or lease; and if any judgment or decree shall in any such case be rendered against the city therein, the holder of said franchise, license or lease shall submit a certified policy. 
    Immediately upon issuance of the franchise, license or lease, the holder of the franchise, license or lease shall purchase general liability insurance. The amount of insurance shall be a minimum of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) with a maximum deductible of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). The holder of the franchise, license or lease shall file with the city administrator, a certificate of insurance which clearly discloses on its face coverage in conformity with these requirements. Upon request of the city, the holder of the franchise, license or lease shall submit a certified copy of the policy. The policy shall contain the following endorsement: "It is understood and agreed that this policy may not be canceled nor the intention not to renew be stated until ninety (90) days after receipt by the city, by registered mail, of a written notice of such intent to cancel." Within sixty (60) days after receipt by the city of said notice, and in no event later than thirty (30) days prior to said cancellation, the holder shall obtain and furnish to the city a replacement insurance policy meeting the city's requirements. 
(Ord. No. 999, § 11, 11-13-97) 
Sec. 22-182. - Regulation by the city. 
    The city reserves the right to make reasonable general regulations for the use of streets and other public property which unless otherwise specifically provided shall apply to any holder of a franchise, license or lease. 
(Ord. No. 999, § 12, 11-13-97) 
Sec. 22-183. - Construction and excavation by holders of franchises or license or leases. 
    A written permit will be obtained from the city public works director whenever it becomes necessary for the holder of any franchise, license or lease to excavate in streets or public grounds of the city. Such permits shall state a particular part or point of the street where the excavation is to be made and the length of time in which such permit shall authorize the work to be done. An exception to a requirement for a permit shall be made in cases of emergency involving public safety, in which case a permit will be obtained at the earliest opportunity after the work has started. 
    In making excavations in the streets, the holder of any franchise, license or lease shall proceed with such work as to cause the least possible inconvenience to the public. The holder of any franchise, placements, as may be determined from time to time by the city public works directors, all excavations and obstructions by proper placement of shoring, surface plates, barricades, warning lights and such other or additional devices circumstances may warrant. If in the opinion of the city public works director such excavation or obstruction is not properly and safely protected, the public works director shall notify such holder of a franchise, license or lease who shall immediately comply with such reasonable instructions. 
    Immediately after use, any trenches for excavations which the holder of a franchise, license or lease has opened shall be filled. However, no trench or excavation in the streets shall be filled or covered without giving the city the right to inspect the same. All backfilling in streets will be according to city specifications. Temporary street surfacing will be placed in such excavations as soon as the same has been backfilled. Pavements, sidewalks, curbs and gutters or other portions of streets and public places opened, disturbed or damaged shall be promptly restored and replaced with like materials at the expense of the holder of a franchise, license or lease and left in as good condition as before the opening, disturbance or damage occurred. In the event like replacement materials are not available, the holder of the franchise, license or lease shall notify the city public works director who must approve the use of any alternate materials. In the event that the holder of a franchise, license or lease fails to comply with the provision of this section, after having been given reasonable notice, the city may do such works as may be needed to properly repair such pavements, sidewalks, curbs and gutters or other portions of streets and public places and the cost thereof shall be repaid to the city by the holder of the franchise, license or lease. In cases where a cut or disturbance is made in a section of street paving or sidewalks, but causes greater disturbance than to just the area cut, rather than replace only the area cut, the holder of a franchise, license or lease shall replace that area as may be ordered by the city public works director, which in no event shall exceed the panel or panels disturbed. 
(Ord. No. 999, § 13, 11-13-97) 
Sec. 22-184. - City construction and paving. 
    Whenever the city shall pave or repave any street or shall change the grade line of any street or public place or shall construct or reconstruct any conduit, water main service or water connection, sewer or other city-owned public works or city-owned utility, it shall be the duty of the holder of any franchise, license or lease, when so ordered by the city, to relocate its service lines and other property in the streets or other public places at its own expense so as to conform to the established grade or line of such street or public place and so as not to interfere with the public improvements so constructed or reconstructed. In the case of other public improvements, including but not limited to urban renewal projects, the city may require the holder of a franchise, license or lease to relocate its poles, service lines and appurtenances in the streets at the owner's expense. 
    The city may at its discretion assign personnel for inspection of excavation and related work being performed by the holder of a franchise, license or lease. Should the holder of the franchise, license or lease fail or refuse to do and perform the things provided in this section, the city may, after reasonable notice, perform the work and charge the expense thereof to the holder of the franchise, license or lease and the holder of the franchise, license or lease shall promptly pay said charges. 
(Ord. No. 999, § 14, 11-13-97) 
Sec. 22-185. - Design notice to city. 
    The holder of a franchise, license or lease shall promptly, upon request, furnish the city public works director a detailed map or maps of its distribution system both within the city limits and the area within two (2) miles surrounding the city unless that area is within another city. The holder of the franchise, license or lease shall thereafter update the map or maps at least annually or upon request, showing all subsequent additions or deletions to the distribution system. Prior to any excavation by the city or its agents, a representative must contact the holder of any franchise, license or lease regarding current information on the location of underground lines or facilities in the area concerned. The obligation to contact the holder of a franchise, license or lease under this section shall be satisfied if contact is made with a corporation organized pursuant to Code of Iowa Chapter 480 (1997) or an entity with a similar function utilized by both the city and the company, currently the Iowa One Call System. 
(Ord. No. 999, § 15, 11-13-97) 
Sec. 22-186. - Above-ground cables, wires, conduits and poles. 
    All cables, wires and conduits shall be placed underground except where above-ground connection to buildings or other locations above ground is reasonably necessary. Such above-ground connection shall be by means of poles located, as far as reasonably practical, within alleys. No such poles shall be installed or erected until the public works department have approved the proposed location, construction and pole heights. 
(Ord. No. 999, § 16, 11-13-97) 
Sec. 22-187. - Assignment. 
    No sale or assignment of any franchise, license or lease of the use of the public right-of-way or other public property shall be effective until it is approved by the city council and until the holder thereof has filed in the office of the city clerk written notice of the proposed sale, transfer, disposition assignment, such notice to clearly summarize the proposed procedure and the terms and conditions thereof. Such approval by the city shall not be unreasonably withheld. The proposed vendee, assignee or lessee shall similarly file an instrument, duly executed, reciting such proposal, accepting the terms of the franchise, license or lease and agreeing to perform all of the conditions thereof. 
(Ord. No. 999, § 17, 11-13-97) 
Sec. 22-188. - Forfeiture. 
    The violation of any material portion of a franchise, license or lease by the holder thereof or its successors or assigns, or its failure promptly to perform any of the provisions of this article shall be cause for forfeiture of said franchise, license or lease and the termination of all rights thereunder. Such forfeiture shall be accomplished by ordinance or resolution of the city, whichever is applicable, after written notice to the holder by certified mail thereof and a continuation of the violation, failure or default specified on the notice for at least thirty (30) days from the date the notice was served. 
(Ord. No. 999, § 18, 11-13-97) 
Sec. 22-189. - Agreement. 
    No franchise, license or lease granted hereunder shall be effective until the applicant and the city have executed an agreement setting forth the particular terms and provisions under which the use of the public way will be granted. 
(Ord. No. 999, § 19, 11-13-97) 
Sec. 22-190. - Application.

A separate and distinct offense shall be deemed committed each day on which a violation occurs or continues. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit any judicial remedies that the city may have, at law or in equity, for enforcement of this article. 
(Ord. No. 999, § 21, 11-13-97) 
Sec. 22-192. - Severability. 
    If any such section or provision of this article is held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect the validity of any other provisions of this article which can be given effect without the invalid portion or portions and to this end each section and provision of this article is severable. 
(Ord. No. 999, § 22, 11-13-97) 
Sec. 22-193. - Home rule. 
    This article is intended to be and shall be construed as consistent with the reservation of local authority contained in the 25th Amendment to the Iowa Constitution granting cities Home Rule powers.

(Ord. No. 999, § 23, 11-13-97) 
Sec. 22-194. - New technologies. 
    Should, within the term of any franchise, license or lease, developments within the field for which the grant was made offer to the holder thereof the opportunity to effectively, efficiently and economically serve its customers through use of a substance or material other than those for which the grant was originally made, then the holder of the franchise, license or lease may petition the city council which, with such requirements or limitation as it deems necessary to protect public health, safety and welfare, may allow the use of such substances under the terms and conditions of the franchise, license or lease.

(4)  To assure the development of land for the highest possible use with all the necessary protection against deterioration and obsolescence; 
(5)  To provide common grounds of understanding and sound working relationship between the city and the developer. 
(Code 1969, § 18.04.020) 
Sec. 23-4. - Compliance; jurisdiction. 
    No person shall subdivide any tract of land which is located within the city, or in any unincorporated area which is located entirely or in part within two (2) miles of the city, except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. 
    The requirement described in this section, as it concerns unincorporated areas, is made pursuant to Iowa Code Section 409A.9. 
(Code 1969, § 18.08.101; Ord. No. 593, § 2, 12-1-82; Ord. No. 813, § 1, 11-27-91) 
Sec. 23-5. - General provisions for platting, subdivision, etc. 
(a)  Whenever any subdivision of land shall be laid out within the incorporated limits of the city, or within contiguous territory not more than two (2) miles beyond the incorporated boundary of the city, the subdivider thereof or his agent shall submit both a preliminary and a final subdivision plat to the planning and zoning commission and the city council for its approval. The subdivision plats and all procedures relating thereto shall in all respects be in full compliance with this chapter. 
(b)  Until plats and plans for the subdivision are approved: 
(1)  No land shall be subdivided, nor any street laid out, nor any improvements made to the natural land. 
(2)  No lot, tract or parcel of land within any subdivision shall be offered for sale nor shall any sale, contract for sale or option be made or given. 
(3)  No improvements, such as sidewalks, water supply, storm water drainage, sanitary sewerage facilities, gas service, electric service, lighting, grading, paving or surfacing of streets shall hereafter be made by any owner or owners or his or their agent, or by any public service corporation at the request of such owner or owners or his or their agent. 
(c)  All offerings or dedications of land to the city for as streets, highways, alleys, schools, parks, playgrounds, other public uses shall be referred to the planning and zoning commission for review and recommendation, before being accepted by the council. 
(d)  Where a tract of land proposed for subdivision is part of a larger, logical subdivision unit in relation to the city as a whole, the planning and zoning commission or the city council may, before approval, cause to be prepared a plan for the entire area or neighborhood, such plan to be used as an aid in judging the proposed plat. 
(e)  Whenever an area is subdivided into lots of thirty thousand (30,000) square feet or more, and there are indications that such lots will eventually be resubdivided into smaller building lots, consideration shall be given to the street and lot arrangement of the original subdivision, so that additional minor streets can be located which will permit a logical arrangement of smaller lots. 
(f)  In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be the minimum requirements. 
(g)  Every subdivision shall be provided with a storm sewer and drainage system. The system shall be adequate to serve the platted area for a five-year frequency design storm without overtopping street curbs or ponding in yard areas other than retention/detention areas specifically designed for that purpose. In addition, the developer shall provide evidence that a one hundred-year frequency design storm will not flood the lowest floor elevation of proposed construction or the lowest floor elevations of existing downstream development(s). All improvements shall meet the approval of the city public works director in direct consultation with the building and zoning administrator. 
(h)  A complete grading/drainage plan shall be prepared by an engineer/architect licensed in Iowa that shall indicate the grade and size of all storm sewers and drainage ways. Drainage calculations shall also be submitted for review. 
(i)  Drainage easements shall be furnished whenever any stream, surface watercourse, or storm sewer is located in the area being subdivided. 
(j)  The developer shall provide site improvements to assure that surface water drainage will have no greater impact on downstream properties after full development. This shall include provisions for storm water retention/detention facilities such as slotted vane drain(s) or catch basin systems that limit the amount of initial discharge of surface water or equivalents. 
    Where the conditions imposed by any provision of this chapter upon the use of land are either more restrictive or less restrictive than comparable conditions imposed by any other provision of this chapter, or any other law, ordinance, resolution, rule, or regulation of any kind, (county or state) the regulations which are more restrictive or which impose higher standards or requirements shall govern. 
    This chapter is not intended to abrogate any easement, covenant or any other private agreement, provided that where the regulations are more restrictive, or impose higher standards or requirements than such easements, covenants or other private agreements, the requirements of this chapter shall govern.

Sec. 23-6. - Variances. 
    Where the city planning and zoning commission finds that extraordinary hardship may result from strict compliance with this chapter, it may vary the regulations so that substantial justice may be done, and the public interest secured; provided that such variation will not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of the comprehensive plan of the city, or this chapter. Any such variation as sanctioned by the planning and zoning commission, must be submitted to and approved by the council.

Sec. 23-37. - Streets. 
(a)  All streets shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in their relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets. 
(b)  Where such is not shown on the general development plan, the arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either: 
(1)  Provide for the continuation, or appropriate projection of existing principal streets in surrounding areas; or 
(2)  Conform to a plan for the area or neighborhood approved, or adopted by the planning and zoning commission to meet a particular situation, where topographical or other conditions make continuance or conformance to existing streets impracticable. 
(c)  Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. 
(d)  Where a subdivision abuts, or contains an existing or proposed highway or primary thoroughfare, as shown on the general development plan, the city planning and zoning commission may require marginal access streets, and reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reserved area, at least ten (10) feet wide, along the rear property line; deep lots with rear service alleys; or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties, and to afford separation of through and local traffic. 
(e)  Where a subdivision borders on, or contains a railroad or highway, the planning and zoning commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such railroad or highway, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes in appropriate districts, or for commercial or industrial purposes in appropriate districts. Such distances shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations. 
(f)  Reserve strips controlling access to streets or alleys shall be prohibited. 
(g)  All street intersections and confluences should encourage safe traffic flow. 
(h)  Street jogs with centerline offsets at intersections of less than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet shall be avoided.

(Ord. No. 628, § 3, 11-7-84) 
Sec. 23.5-2. - Partial tax exemption for industrial property. 
(a)  [Purpose;] established. The purpose of this section is to establish a partial exemption from property taxation, of the actual value added to industrial real estate by the new construction of industrial real estate, research service facilities, warehouses and distribution centers, as described in Sections 427B.1 through 427B.4 of the Iowa Code (1991). 
(b)  Definitions. The words and terms contained in this subsection have the following meanings ascribed to them for the purpose of this section: 
    Actual value added means the actual value added as of the first year for which the exemption is received. 
    Distribution center means a building or structure used primarily for the storage of goods which are intended for subsequent shipment to retail outlets. The term "distribution center" does not mean a building or structure used primarily to store raw agricultural products, used primarily by a manufacturer to store goods to be used in the manufacturing process, used primarily for the storage of petroleum products, or used for the retail sale of goods. 
    New construction means new buildings and structures and includes new buildings and structures which are constructed as additions to existing buildings and structures. The term "new construction" does not include reconstruction of an existing building or structure which does not constitute complete replacement of an existing building or structure or refitting of an existing building or structure, unless the reconstruction of an existing building or structure is required due to economic obsolescence and the reconstruction is necessary to implement recognized industry standards for the manufacturing and processing of specific products and the reconstruction is required for the owner of the building or structure to continue to competitively manufacture or process those products which determination shall receive prior approval from the city council, as described hereafter in subsection (e), and upon the recommendation of the state department of economic development. 
    Research-service facilities means a building or group of buildings devoted primarily to research and development activities, including, but not limited to, the design and production or manufacture of prototype products for experimental use, and corporate-research services which do not have a primary purpose of providing on-site services to the public. 
    Warehouse means a building or structure used as a public warehouse for the storage of goods pursuant to chapter 554, article 7, of the Iowa Code (1991), except that it does not mean a building or structure used primarily to store raw agricultural products or from which goods are sold at retail. 
(c)  Exemption granted. The actual value added to industrial real estate for the reasons specified in subsection (a) is eligible to receive a partial exemption from taxation for a period of five (5) years, upon proper application by the property owner to the local assessor as described in subsection (f); upon compliance with the requirements of the Iowa Department of Revenue; and upon compliance with the requirements of subsection (e), if applicable. The amount of actual value added which is eligible to be exempt from taxation shall be as follows: 
(1)  For the first year, seventy-five (75) percent. 
(2)  For the second year, sixty (60) percent. 
(3)  For the third year, forty-five (45) percent. 
(4)  For the fourth year, thirty (30) percent. 
(5)  For the fifth year, fifteen (15) percent. 
(d)  Exemption ineligibility. Industrial property otherwise eligible for a tax exemption under this section shall not be granted such an exemption upon the following occurrences: 
(1)  If the property ceases to be classified as industrial real estate or ceases to be used as a warehouse or distribution center, then the partial exemption for the value added shall not be allowed for subsequent assessment years. 
(2)  If, in the case of new construction constituting complete replacement of an existing building or structure, the exemption would result in the assessed value of the industrial real estate being reduced below the assessed value of the industrial real estate before the start of the new construction added. 
(3)  The property for which the exemption is claimed has received any other property tax exemption authorized by law. 
(e)  Reconstruction, approval procedure required prior to filing application for exemption. All reconstruction of industrial property shall be approved by ordinance in the manner provided in this subsection to be eligible for a partial tax exemption. The procedure for receiving such approval shall be as follows:

b.  The nature of the property owner's business including the products manufactured or processed by the business. 
c.  The location of the reconstruction project and its zoning classification. 
d.  A detailed description of the reconstruction involved and its estimated costs. If the reconstruction is being performed in connection with a project also involving other new construction, the description and cost of the total project shall be included. 
e.  The purpose of the reconstruction project, including specific evidence and justification that the reconstruction is required and necessary: 
1.  Due to economic obsolescence; 
2.  To implement recognized industry standards for the manufacturing and processing of specific products; and 
3.  For the owner to continue to competitively manufacture or process those products. 
(2)  Upon receiving the written request, the city council shall set the matter for public hearing. 
(3)  The city council shall hold a public hearing on the requested ordinance following notice thereof according to law. 
(4)  Not less than thirty (30) days after said public hearing, the city council shall enact an ordinance approving the reconstruction as being eligible for partial tax exemption; provided the state development commission has made a recommendation for approval and the reconstruction is found to be required and necessary: 
a.  Due to economic obsolescence; 
b.  To implement recognized industry standards for the manufacturing and processing of specific products; and 
c.  For the owner to continue to competitively manufacture those products. 
(5)  The ordinance adopted shall incorporate the required findings, and the city clerk shall file a certified copy of it in the office of the local assessor. 
(6)  In the event the ordinance is disapproved because the necessary determinations could not be made as required, the property owner may submit a revised reconstruction proposal which shall be submitted in the same manner as the original request. 
(f)  Application for exemption. An application for a partial exemption from taxation shall be filed for each project resulting in actual value added for which an exemption is claimed. The application for exemption shall be filed by the owner of the property with the local assessor by February 1 of the assessment year in which the value added is first assessed for taxation. Applications for exemptions shall be made on forms prescribed by the state department of revenue, and shall contain information pertaining to the nature of the improvement, its costs, and other information deemed necessary by the state department of revenue. 
(g)  Application for partial tax exemption guarantee. A property owner may submit a proposal to the city involving planned new construction of industrial property, including approved reconstruction, and request an ordinance guaranteeing the granting of a partial tax exemption as described in subsection (c), if the new construction is in conformance with the zoning plans for the city. Such a proposal shall be submitted and considered as follows: 
(1)  The property owner shall file the proposal in writing with the city clerk not more than three (3) years before the planned new construction is to be completed. Said proposal shall be filed in quintuplicate and shall contain the following information: 
a.  The business name and address of the property owner seeking the exemption and the name, title, address and phone number of the company officer with whom communications may be made regarding the proposal. 
b.  The nature of the property owner's business, including the products manufactured or processed by the business. 
c.  The location of the planned new construction and its zoning classification. 
d.  A detailed description of the planned new construction and its estimated cost. 
e.  The purpose and goal of the planned new construction, including information concerning proposed employment, community impact and necessity for receiving a prior approval of tax exemption, as well as any other relevant data and explanations. 
f.  The written proposal described herein may be combined with the required written request under subsection (e), provided all information under both provisions is provided. 
(2)  Upon receiving the written proposal, the city council shall set the matter for public hearing. 
(3)  Not less than thirty (30) days after said public hearing, the city council may enact an ordinance granting prior approval of a tax exemption conditioned upon the new construction being completed as proposed and found to be qualified real estate. The granting of a prior approval of this tax exemption shall be discretionary. 
(4)  If an ordinance is adopted hereunder, it shall identify the planned new construction and incorporate any conditions required by the city council. The city council shall file a certified copy of the ordinance in the office of the local assessor. 
(5)  In the event an ordinance approving the proposal is not adopted, the property owner may submit an amended proposal to the city council for consideration following the same procedure as in the making of the original proposal. 
(h)  Repeal of exemption provisions. The provisions of this section may be repealed whenever, in the opinion of the city council, the granting of partial tax exemptions hereunder ceases to be of benefit to the city. In the event this section is repealed, all existing exemptions shall continue until their expiration and partial tax exemptions which have not yet begun but which have received a guarantee of partial tax exemption pursuant to subsection (g) shall take effect and continue throughout their applicable period as provided hereunder.

The access equipment and facilities fee paid by the Grantee to the Grantor shall be payable in the same manner as the franchise fee payment pursuant to Section 5.1 hereof. The Grantor acknowledges that this amount shall not be considered gross revenues subject to the payment of franchise fees pursuant to Section 5.1 hereof. Furthermore, payments of this ongoing support shall not be deemed to be "franchise fees" within the meaning of Section 622 of the Cable Act and such payment shall not be deemed to be "payments-in-kind" or any involuntary payments chargeable against the compensation to be paid to the Grantor by Grantee pursuant to Section 5.1 hereof. The Grantee shall be allowed to collect such fee as a pass through to cable subscribers. The fee shall be revised on an annual basis in accordance with the consumer price index (CPI). 
    Prior to the implementation of the proposed fee, the Franchising Authority shall conduct a written survey mutually acceptable to the Grantor and the Grantee of cable subscribers to verify that a majority of the subscribers support the need for such a fee.

Should a dispute arise over any matter regarding additional services, the dispute may be resolved in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance relating to methods of resolving disputes. Nothing in this section shall preclude the offering of such new service on a temporary or experimental basis. 
4.9  Technical standards. 
A.  Methods of construction, installation, and maintenance of the cable television system shall comply with the most recent National Electrical Code to the extent that such Code is consistent with local law affecting the construction, installation, maintenance of electric supply and communications lines.

At such time as the FCC does not regulate technical standards, Grantee will continue to comply with the FCC standards which were effective prior to such discontinuance of regulation by the FCC. 
4.10  Filing of maps. Upon request of the Grantor, the Grantee shall file with the Grantor strand maps, showing the location of all property and facilities of the Grantee within the City. All such maps shall be considered confidential and proprietary, if marked as such by the Grantee.

Each payment shall be accompanied with a detailed report showing the basis for the computation, specific income categories, and such other relevant facts as may be required by the Grantor necessary to determine the accuracy of the franchise payment as specified in Section 5.1-3 of this ordinance. The acceptance of any payment shall not be construed as an accord that the amount paid is, in fact, the correct amount; nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim the Grantor may have for additional sums payable by the Grantee. All amounts paid shall be subject to audit and recompilation by the Grantor. 
3.  Franchise fee audit. The Grantee will fully cooperate with a franchise fee audit performed by a professional firm that is chosen by the Grantor. The costs associated with the audit will be paid for by the Grantor, provided that the Grantee shall pay for the costs if the audit shows an underpayment of franchise fees in excess of five percent (5%) or more. In addition, the Grantor and Grantee will design a mutually agreeable form to be used by the Grantee that reflects a breakout of the items used to calculate the franchise fees paid to the Grantor. 
4.  Franchise fee increases. The Grantor may request an increase in franchise fees at any time during the term of the franchise, equal to the maximum allowed by federal law.

5.4  Conditions of sale. If a renewal or extension of the Grantee's franchise is denied or the franchise is lawfully terminated, and the Franchising Authority either lawfully acquires ownership of the Cable System or by its actions lawfully effects a transfer of ownership of the Cable System to another person, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at a price determined pursuant to the provisions set forth in Section 627 of the Cable Act. 
5.5  Transfer of franchise. 
1.  Transfer of Franchise. Any franchise granted under this Ordinance shall be a privilege to be held for the benefit of the public. Any franchise so granted cannot, in any event, be sold, transferred, leased, assigned or disposed of, including, but not limited to, by forced or voluntary sale, except to entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with the Grantee, without the prior written consent of the Franchising Authority. Such consent as required by the Franchising Authority, shall be given or denied no later than one hundred twenty (120) days following any request and shall not be unreasonable withheld. Prior consent shall not be required when transferring the franchise between wholly-owned subsidiaries of the same entity.

Further, said financial institution shall also submit a plan for such operation that will ensure continued service and compliance with all franchise requirements during the term the financial institution exercises control over the system. The financial institution shall not exercise control over the Cable System for a period exceeding one (1) year, unless extended by the Franchising Authority at its discretion, but during said period of time it shall have the right to petition the Franchising Authority to transfer the franchise to another Grantee. Except insofar as the enforceability of this subsection may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors rights generally, and further subject to applicable federal, state or local law, if the Franchising Authority finds that such transfer, after considering the legal, financial, character, technical and other public interest qualities of the proposed transferee, is satisfactory, the Franchising Authority shall transfer and assign the right and obligations of such franchise as in the public interest. 
4.  The consent or approval of the Franchising Authority to any transfer by the Grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the Franchising Authority in and to the streets, and any transfer shall by its terms, be expressly subject to the terms and conditions of any franchise. 
5.  In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be approved without the successor in interest becoming a signatory of the Franchise Agreement.

6.1  Testing for compliance. The Grantor shall have the right to compel the Grantee to test, analyze, and report on the performance of the Cable System. The Grantor may also employ technically qualified personnel to perform technical tests of the Cable System during reasonable times and in a manner which does not unreasonably interfere with the normal business operations of the Grantee or the Cable System in order to determine whether or not the Grantee is in compliance with the terms hereof and applicable state or federal laws. Such tests may be undertaken only after giving the Grantee reasonable notice thereof, not to be less than ten business days, and providing a representative of the Grantee has an opportunity to be present during such tests. In the event that such testing demonstrates that the Grantee has substantially failed to comply with a material requirement hereof, the reasonable costs of such tests shall be borne by the Grantee. In the event that such testing demonstrates that the Grantee has substantially complied with such material provisions hereof, the cost of such testing shall be borne by the Franchising Authority.

The Franchising Authority or its certified public accountant upon reasonable notice to the Grantee may review such of its books and records at the Grantee's business office, during normal business hours and on a nondisruptive basis, as is reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with the terms hereof. Such records shall include, but shall not be limited to, any public records required to be kept by the Grantee pursuant to the rules and regulations of the FCC. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the Grantee shall not be required to disclose information which it reasonably deems to be proprietary or confidential in nature under state and federal rules of evidence. The Franchising Authority agrees to treat any information disclosed by the Grantee as confidential and only to disclose it to employees, representatives, and agents thereof that have a need to know, or in order to enforce the provisions hereof. The Grantee shall not be required to provide subscriber information in violation of Section 631 of the Cable Act.

The principal means for accomplishing this flexibility will be the scheduled review sessions provided for in this Ordinance. It is intended that such review sessions will serve as a means of cooperatively working out solutions to problems that develop. Furthermore, such review sessions shall be two-way processes.

Upon such withdrawal, the City Clerk shall notify the company of the amount and date thereof. 
D.  The security fund deposited pursuant to this section shall become the property of the Grantor in the event that this contract is canceled by reason of the default of the Grantee.

Interest earned by the investment of the security fund will accrue to the Grantee. 
E.  The rights reserved to the Grantor with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the Grantor, whether reserved by this franchise or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding, or exercise of a right with respect to such security fund shall affect any other right the Grantor may have.

C.  Franchise fee audit. The Grantee will fully cooperate with a franchise fee audit performed by a professional firm that is chosen by the Grantor.

The cable system shall be designed to allow each Subscriber drop to provide service to three (3) television outlets. 
D.  Exhibit B. The provisions of Exhibit B referenced here and incorporated into this Agreement. 
E.  Penalty. In the event the Grantee fails to complete the upgrade within two (2) years of the effective date of this Franchise Agreement according to the terms of this section, Grantee agrees to pay to the City one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) per day for each day construction is not complete. 
Section 8. Capital equipment grant community programming. The Grantee will provide the City with a one-time capital grant of $10,000 for the purchase of capital equipment or facilities for use in conjunction with the PEG channel on October 1, 1999. The Grantee shall provide an additional one-time $5000 capital equipment grant June 30, 2001 or later provided; 
A.  The City requests said additional grant no less than sixty (60) days prior to June 30,2001 or any subsequent later date; 
B.  The City provides evidence of a minimum of PEG capital funding in the amount of $10,000 from the City's own funds which may include Franchise Fee revenue. Funding shall not include payments-in-kind to meet the matching requirement of this section. 
Section 9. Activated channels. Prior to the completion of the system upgrade, the Grantee shall provide a minimum of thirty-four (34) activated channels on the Cable System. 
Section 10. Service area. Grantee shall offer cable television service to all residents of the City which are located in the corporate limits of the City of Mount Pleasant within 1 year of the effective date of this Franchise. Normal installation costs for any customer shall apply to all residents where the cable drop is 150 feet or less from the Public Right-Of-Way easement closest to the potential customer's residence. The additional cost of delivering service exceeding 150 feet from the closest public right-of-way may be billed to the Subscriber. Business and industrial subscribers shall be subject to the Extensions of Service and Customer Charges for Extensions of Service Requirements set forth in Sections 11 and 12 of this Franchise Agreement. 
Grantee shall, at its expense and within one year of annexation, extend service to newly annexed areas to the City not then served by a Cable System where the average density is at least thirty (30) dwelling units per lineal mile of proposed trunk and feeder cable route. For purposes of this Section of the Agreement, mile measurements shall originate from drop point of the last subscriber closest to the potential new subscriber area. 
Section 11. Required extensions of service. Whenever the Grantee shall receive a request for service from at least 15 residences within 1320 cable-bearing strand feet (one-quarter cable mile) of its trunk or distribution cable, it shall extend its Cable System to such Customers at no cost to said Customers for Cable System extension, other than the usual connection fees for all Customers; provided that such extension is Technically Feasible, and if it will not adversely affect the operation, financial condition, or market development of the Cable System, or as provided for under Section 12 of this Franchise. 
Section 12. Customer charges for extensions of service. No Customer shall be refused service arbitrarily. However, for unusual circumstances, such as a Customer's request to locate the House Drop underground, existence of more than 150 feet of distance from distribution cable to connection of service to Customers, or a density of less than 15 residences and/or businesses per 1320 cable-bearing strand feet of trunk or distribution cable, service may be made available on the basis of a capital contribution in aid of construction, including cost of material, labor, and easements. For the purpose of determining the amount of capital contribution in aid of construction to be borne by the Grantee and Customers in the area in which service may be expanded, the Grantee will contribute an amount equal to the construction necessary to extend the plant and install service, multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of residences and/or businesses per 1320 cable-bearing strand feet of its trunks or distribution cable, and whose denominator equals 15 residences and/or businesses. Customers who request service hereunder will bear the remainder of the construction and other costs on a pro rata basis. The Grantee may require that the payment of the capital contribution in aid of construction borne by such potential Customers be paid in advance. This Section shall not apply to potential residential Subscribers who desire service and are located in the city limits as defined as of the date of adoption of the agreement as set forth in Section 10 of the Agreement. 
[An example of the application of Section 12 of the Agreement would be a situation wherein a business requested service in an unserved area that has a density of 10 residences and/or businesses per 1320 feet and an estimated cost to deliver service of $5,000.00. The Grantee would therefore contribute $5,000 multiplied by 10/15 or $3,333.34 and the business would contribute $1,666.34 under this method. The intent of the section is to increase the Grantee contribution and reduce the business contribution as density increases.] 
Section 13. Authority to trim trees. The Grantee shall have the authority under the supervision and direction of the Grantor to trim trees or other natural growth overhanging any of its Cable System in the street or alley right-of-way so as to prevent branches from coming in contact with the Grantee's wires, cables, or other equipment. 
Section 14. Temporary drops. Temporary underground drops will be buried within forty-five (45) days of installation, weather permitting. In the event Grantee fails to bury drops within forty-five (45) days, the Grantor shall notify the Grantee of violation of this Section in accordance with the Enforcement and Termination of Franchise Section of this Agreement. In the event that the Grantee fails to bury any drops within the forty-five-day period, the Grantee shall provide basic and expanded basic cable service without charge to the affected subscriber from the last date that the drop was to have been buried to the actual date that it is buried. 
All subscriber drops and house drops that are located underground shall comply with National Electric Code (NEC) standards, a minimum of six (6) inches in depth. 
Section 15. Local office. A business and service office, conveniently located within the City, shall be open during normal business hours, and adequately staffed to accept subscriber payments and respond to service requests and complaints. In lieu of a local office, the Grantee may provide an agent of the Grantee to receive subscriber payments that shall be located in the Service Area on a site readily accessible to the general public. The current location at the Mount Pleasant Chamber of Commerce is deemed to be the preferred location. 
Section 16. Insurance coverage and notifications. The Grantee shall maintain insurance in such amounts and kinds of coverages as may be specified by the Grantor in the Franchise Agreement. Such coverages may be reasonably adjusted by the Grantor with ninety-day notification, provided that the Grantor demonstrates the need for increases in coverages. The Grantee shall maintain such insurance with insurance underwriters authorized to do business in the State of Iowa. All policies shall name the Grantor, its employees, servants, agents, and officers as additional insured parties. Each policy shall provide that it may not be canceled nor the amount of coverage altered until thirty (30) days after receipt by the City Clerk of a registered mail notice of such intent to cancel or alter coverage. The Grantee shall provide a certificate of insurance designating the Grantor as an additional insured. 
The Grantee shall maintain and provide to the City Clerk proof of Public Liability Insurance for not less than the following amounts: 
$2,000,000 - Any 1 Occurrence, Bodily Injury or Property Damage 
$2,000,000 - Products/Completed Operations Annual Aggregate Liability

The Grantor specifically reserves the right to grant at any time during the term of this Franchise or renewal thereof, if any, such additional Franchises for a Cable System as it deems appropriate.

Section 19. City's right to purchase system. The City shall be entitled to a right of first refusal of any bona fide offer to purchase the Cable System made to Grantee if the Cable System is being sold separately and such sale is not linked in any way to the sale of any other cable system in a separate franchise area. Bona fide offer as used in this section means a written offer which has been accepted by Grantee subject to the City's rights under this Agreement. The City shall notify Grantee of its interest in purchasing the Cable System within thirty (30) days of the City's receipt from Grantee of a copy of the written bona fide offer. Payment shall be made upon closing in readily available funds within one hundred twenty (120) days of the City's receipt from Grantee of a copy of the written bona fide offer.

Within 30 days of receiving the request for transfer, the Franchising Authority shall in accordance with FCC rules and regulations, notify the Grantee in writing of the information it requires to determine the legal, financial and technical qualifications of the transferee. 
Section 21. Force majeure. The Grantee shall not be held in default under, or in noncompliance with, the provisions of the Franchise, nor suffer any enforcement or penalty relating to noncompliance or default (including termination, cancellation or revocation of the Franchise), where such noncompliance or alleged defaults occurred or were caused by strike, riot, war, earthquake, flood, tidal wave, unusually severe rain or snow storm, hurricane, tornado or other catastrophic act of nature, labor disputes, governmental, administrative or judicial order or regulation or other event that is reasonably beyond the Grantee's ability to anticipate and control. This provision also covers work delays caused by waiting for utility providers to service or monitor their own utility poles on which the Grantee's cable and/or equipment is attached, as well as unavailability of materials and/or qualified labor to perform the work necessary. 
Section 22. Equal protection. In the event the Franchising Authority enters into a Franchise, permit, license, authorization, or other agreement of any kind with any other Person or entity other than the Grantee to enter into the Franchising Authority's Public Ways for the purpose of constructing or operating a Cable System or providing Cable Service to any part of the Service Area, the material provisions thereof shall be reasonably comparable to those contained herein, in order that one operator not be granted an unfair competitive advantage over another, and to provide all parties equal protection under the law.

Sec. 19.04.010. - Statement of intent. 
(a)  Within the various districts established by this ordinance or amendments that may later be adopted, there exist structures and uses of land and structures which were lawful prior to the adoption of this ordinance but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the provisions of this ordinance. It is the intent of this ordinance to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed but not to encourage their survival. Such uses are declared by this ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. 
Sec. 19.04.020. - Nonconforming use of land, use of structures and structures in any residential district. 
(a)  Nonconforming use of land. The lawful use of land upon which no building or structure is erected or constructed which becomes nonconforming under the terms of this ordinance, as adopted or amended, may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance; 
(2)  No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel which was not occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance; 
(3)  If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than six (6) months, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the district regulations for the district in which such land is located. 
(b)  Nonconforming use of structures. If a lawful use of a structure, or of a structure and land in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this ordinance, the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  No existing structure devoted entirely or in part to a use not permitted by this ordinance in the district in which it is located, except when required by law, shall be enlarged, extended, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered unless the use is changed to a use permitted in the district in which such structure is located; 
(2)  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this ordinance. No such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building; 
(3)  If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a structure may be changed to another nonconforming use of a similar nature within the same or a more restricted classification. Whenever a nonconforming use has been changed to a more restricted use or to a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less restrictive use; 
(4)  In the event that a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and land in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for a period of one (1) year, the use of the same shall thereafter conform to the uses permitted in the district in which it is located. Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land; 
(5)  Any structure devoted to a use made nonconforming by this ordinance that is destroyed by any means to an extent of sixty (60) percent or more of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, exclusive of the foundations, shall not be reconstructed and used as before such happening. If the structure is less than sixty (60) percent destroyed above the foundation, it may be reconstructed and used as before; provided that it is done within six (6) months of such happening and is built of like or similar materials. 
(c)  Nonconforming structures. Where a structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance that could not be built under the terms of this ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity; 
(2)  Should such structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of sixty (60) percent or more of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance.

The additional fifteen (15) square feet of sign surface area per business shall not be required to advertise individual businesses specifically. When designing business park entrance signs, consideration should be given to providing dedicated facilities for individual businesses to add and remove permanent and temporary signs, but dedicated facilities for individual businesses shall not be required.

(i)  No more than three (3) business park entrance signs shall be permitted for each business park. Signs shall be permitted to be located a reasonable distance away from the business park, as determined by the Building and Zoning Administrator. When determining what is reasonable, the Building and Zoning Administrator shall consider the intention of business park entrance signs as stated in [Section] 19.09.127, public safety, general welfare, the ability of the sign to efficiently direct the traveling public to the business park without causing confusion, and any negative impacts that the business park sign may have on the area in which it is located. 
(j)  Business park entrance signs located off-premise shall clearly indicate a direction to the business park if the direction is not naturally apparent. 
(k)  Business park entrance signs shall not be located closer together than six hundred (600) feet to one another, measured along the right-of-way. 
(l)  Owners of businesses located in a singular development shall have the right to install signs complying with this section which advertise their business on existing business park entrance signs. 
(m)  For the purpose of enforcing applicable ordinances, business park entrance signs shall be considered to be owned by the owner of the real estate upon which the sign is located, or the owners of businesses advertised on the sign. If no specific business are displayed on the sign, and the sign is installed in the right-of-way, the city shall be permitted, but not required, to remove and/or maintain the sign. Under no circumstances shall the city be liable for matters concerning business park entrance signs, be responsible to mediate disputes between business owners concerning business park entrance signs or be responsible for any damage that occurs as a result of the installation of business park signs. 
(n)  Business park entrance signs shall meet all of the applicable requirements of Chapter 306.C, Code of Iowa and federal regulations.

a.  Any sign that becomes obsolete or is obsolete at the time of adoption of these regulations shall be removed by the owner or agent of the property upon which such sign may be found within thirty (30) days after written notification.

(8)  If a billboard remains blank for a continuous period of one hundred eighty (180) days, that billboard shall be deemed obsolete and shall, within thirty (30) days after such obsolescence, be altered to comply with this chapter or be removed by the sign owner, owner of the property where the sign is located, or other person having control over such sign.

(2)  Landscape Buffer: A landscape buffer shall not be less than twenty-five (25) feet in width, designed and landscaped with earth berm and predominant plantings of evergreen type trees, shrubs and plants so as to assure year around effectiveness; height of berm and density and height of plantings shall be adequate to serve as a solid and impenetrable screen. A vinyl coated chain link fence may exist for security purposes, but is not considered a part of the landscape screening to satisfy the intent of this requirement. 
(3)  Any R-3, R-4, R-5, B and M District contiguous to an AR District, or use where adjoining buffer is required, the use of fence or wall, and landscaping required will be determined on a case-by-case basis upon review of the site plan taking into consideration the proposed use within or adjoining the AR District, unless otherwise specified in the zoning ordinance. 
(c)  Burden of Provision of Buffer. The burden of provision and selection of the buffer shall be as follows: 
(1)  Where two (2) different zoning districts, requiring a buffer between them, have been developed, the above requirement is not retroactive and a buffer is not required. If a buffer is desired, it shall be provided by mutual agreement between property owners. However, in the event that any or all of the improved property is abandoned, destroyed or demolished, for the purpose of renewal or redevelopment, that portion of such property being renewed or redeveloped, shall be considered vacant and subject to the requirements herein. 
(2)  Where one (1) of two (2) different Zoning Districts requiring a buffer between them is developed, the developer of the vacant land shall assume the burden, unless otherwise specified herein.

(d)  Waiver of Buffer Requirements. Where the line between two (2) districts, requiring a buffer, follows a street, right-of-way, railroad, stream, or other similar barrier, the requirement for a buffer may be waived by the City Council, provided such waiver does not permit the exposure of undesirable characteristics of land use to public view. 
Sec. 19.12.100. - Architectural standards. 
(a)  Architectural plans for buildings shall be submitted simultaneously with an application for site plan review. Documentation to be submitted shall include building elevations showing the building's design and exterior materials, a materials board, and any other information as deemed necessary to make a determination. Detailed information relating to any lighting or signage on the structure shall be provided, including backlit material or accent lighting. The architectural design shall be in accordance with the standards as contained in this section. 
(1)  Wall Area Defined. In the application of these requirements, some standards are based upon a percentage of the wall area. The wall area is defined as the total square feet of the exterior elevation of the building in a single plane that is perpendicular to the point-of-view and vertical to the ground. It may contain a gable end or dormer in the same plane of view. It does not contain the elevation area of a pitched roof, but would include the area of a parapet wall. Each elevation must comply with the standards unless otherwise provided for herein or as approved by the City Council. 
(2)  Multiple-Family Dwellings in All Districts. Multiple-family buildings shall be designed in a manner compatible with residential uses in the vicinity. Architectural design for multiple-family buildings shall attempt to lessen the plainness of appearance which can be characteristic of large residential buildings. Multiple-family buildings with plane walls and boxy appearance are not acceptable. Their architectural design shall use a combination of the following design techniques as appropriate. 
a.  Exterior building materials shall employ a variety of textures and colors and window and door details. 
b.  The roof shall be principally of gable, hip style or similar residential roof design. 
c.  The structures perimeter shall be varied when multiple buildings are proposed. 
d.  Multiple buildings shall be sited at angles with one another. 
(3)  Structures Within the B District: Building architectural design shall recognize the importance of material strength and permanency through the selection of building materials, and the principle of structural strength and permanency shall dominate the structural and exterior materials and components. The primary material shall constitute at least seventy-five (75) percent of the wall area, excluding glass. The primary exterior material shall consist of a combination of brick, textured concrete block, or concrete, steel, vinyl, or stone panels provided that they contain some architectural relief and provided they exhibit the structural strength and permanency desired. The standard shall apply to all sides of any building. The remaining exterior material shall be considered as building trim. For the purposes of this section, trim is defined as an ornamental design feature, that when removed does not significantly alter the appearance of the building. It would commonly consist of building elements such as moldings, cornices, parapet, frieze, sills, lintels, stringcourse, quoining, and ledgment. The maximum amount of trim on the wall area, excluding glass, shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent. No wood, masonite, asphaltic exterior wall or roof material, aluminum or steel siding, non-architectural sheet metal, non-textured concrete block, stucco, E.I.F.S. (Exterior Insulation and Finish Systems) or other similar materials shall constitute a portion of any building except as trim. 
(4)  All Uses Within the M District: Architectural design shall employ materials common in the district and vicinity of the building. The exclusive use of sheet metal as an exterior building material is not acceptable for buildings in close proximity to public streets. For buildings within three hundred (300) feet of the public street, the exterior materials of the wall area facing the public street shall be comprised of no less than fifty (50) percent brick, architectural concrete panels, textured concrete block, architectural steel or stone panels. 
(5)  Other Non-Residential Structures: All other non-residential structures shall be designed in a manner compatible with their surroundings. Design shall be in compliance with paragraph (3) above. However, the City Council may prescribe an alternative that would be compatible with existing and proposed structures in the surrounding area. 
(6)  General Provisions: Adequate treatment or screening of negative aspects of buildings (loading docks, loading areas, outside storage areas, garbage dumpsters and HVAC mechanical units) from any public street and adjoining properties shall be required. Preference is given to siting loading docks or loading areas out of view from public streets. 
Sec. 19.12.110. - Expiration of approval. 
(a)  All site plan approvals shall expire and terminate one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of city council approval unless a building permit has been issued for the construction provided for in the site plan. The city council may, upon written request by the developer, extend the time for the issuance of a building permit for sixty (60) days. In the event the building permit for the construction provided for in a site plan expires or is canceled then such site plan approval shall thereupon terminate. 
Sec. 19.12.120. - Signs. 
(a)  Signs shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 19.09.

Any proposed change in the development plan after approval by the council shall be resubmitted and considered in the same manner as the original proposal. For the purposes of this section, the term unimproved property shall mean all property situated within a stage or stages of the final development plan upon which the installation of improvements has not been commenced.

Sec. 19.43.030. - Airport zones. 
(a)  In order to carry out the provisions of this ordinance, there are hereby created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces, and conical surfaces as they apply to the Mount Pleasant Municipal Airport. Such zones are shown on the Mount Pleasant Municipal Airport Zoning map, which is attached to this ordinance and made a part hereof. An area located in more than one (1) of the following zones is considered to be only in the one with the more restrictive height limitation. The various ones are hereby established and defined as follows: 
(1)  Utility runway nonprecision instrument approach zone: The inner edge of this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is five hundred (500) feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of two thousand (2,000) feet at a horizontal distance five thousand (5,000) feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is the continuation of the centerline of the runway. 
(2)  Transitional zones: The transitional zones are the areas beneath the transitional surfaces. 
(3)  Horizontal zone: The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs of five thousand (5,000) feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs. The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones. 
(4)  Conical zone: The conical zone is established as the area that commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward therefrom a horizontal distance of four thousand (4,000) feet. 
Sec. 19.43.040. - Airport zone height limitations. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided in this ordinance, no structure call be erected, altered, or maintained, and no tree shall be allowed to grow in any zone created by this ordinance to a height in excess of the applicable height limit herein established for such zone. Such applicable height limitations are hereby established for each of the zones in question as follows: 
(1)  Utility runway nonprecision instrument approach zone: Slopes twenty (20) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of five thousand (5,000) feet along the extended runway centerline. 
(2)  Transitional zones: Slope seven (7) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and the approach surface, and extending to a height of one hundred fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation which is seven hundred thirty-four (734) feet above mean sea level. In addition to the foregoing, there are established height limits sloping seven (7) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending to where they intersect the conical surface. Where the precision instrument runway approach zone projects beyond the conical zone, there are established height limits sloping seven (7) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface, and extending a horizontal distance of five thousand (5,000) feet measured at ninety (90) degree angles to the extended runway centerline. 
(3)  Horizontal zone: Established at one hundred fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation or at a height of eight hundred eighty-four (884) feet above mean sea level. 
(4)  Conical zone: Slopes twenty (20) feet outward for each foot upward beginning at the periphery of the horizontal zone and at one hundred fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation and extending to a height of three hundred fifty (350) feet above the airport elevation. 
(5)  Excepted height limitations: Nothing in this ordinance shall be construed as prohibiting the construction or maintenance of any structure or growth of any tree to a height up to fifty (50) feet above the surface of the land. 
Sec. 19.43.050. - Use restrictions. 
(a)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, no use may be made of land or water within any zone established by this ordinance in such a manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport, create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport. 
Sec. 19.43.060. - Nonconforming uses. 
(a)  Regulations not retroactive: The regulations prescribed by this ordinance shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date, of this ordinance, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of this ordinance, and is diligently prosecuted. 
(b)  Marking and lighting: Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this section, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of such markers and lights as shall be deemed necessary by the airport zoning administrative officer to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers and lights shall be installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the City of Mount Pleasant, Iowa. 
Sec. 19.43.070. - Permits. 
(a)  Future uses: Except as specifically provided in (1), (2), and (3) hereunder, no material change shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or otherwise established and no tree shall be planted in any zone hereby created unless a permit therefor shall have been applied for and granted. Each application for a permit shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No permit for a use inconsistent with the provisions of this ordinance shall be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with Section 19.43.070(d). 
(1)  In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and conical zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones. 
(2)  In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a horizontal distance of not less than four thousand two hundred (4,200) feet from each end of the runway, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure would extend above the height limit prescribed for such approach zones. 
(3)  In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than seventy-five (75) feet of vertical height above the ground, except when such tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition zones. 
i.  Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this ordinance except as set forth in Section 19.43.040. 
(b)  Existing uses: No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of this ordinance or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted. 
(c)  Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the airport zoning administrative officer determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than eighty (80) percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or destroyed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. 
(d)  Variances: Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this ordinance, may apply to the board of adjustment for a variance from such regulations. The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief granted, will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this ordinance. Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this ordinance may be considered by the board of adjustment unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the airport manager and the airport zoning administrative officer for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the airport manager and the airport zoning administrative officer do not respond to the application within fifteen (15) days after receipt, the board of adjustment may act on its own to grant or deny said application. 
(e)  Obstruction marking and lighting: Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this ordinance and be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate and maintain, at the owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary. If deemed proper by the board of adjustment, this condition may be modified to require the owner to permit the City of Mount Pleasant, Iowa, at its own expense, to install, operate, and maintain the necessary markings and lights. 
Sec. 19.43.080. - Enforcement.
