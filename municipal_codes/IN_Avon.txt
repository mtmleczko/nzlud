merits. Unless such grounds are established, the application may be summarily dismissed for such

however, be required to place in the record all evidence available concerning changes of
conditions or new facts that have developed since the denial of the first application or petition. In

Zoning Administrator. The certificate of occupancy shall state that the proposed use of the
building and/or land conforms to the requirements of this ordinance and that the Zoning
Administrator has inspected the property and attested to that fact.
A. This Section is not intended to prevent a single family homeowner undergoing a single room

AVON ZONING ORDINANCE
Town of Avon, Indiana 4. Town Ordinance 2002-14
alteration of such building or other improvement of the land shall have been completed and the

Zoning Appeals requesting an additional renewal of the Temporary Certificate of Occupancy for

of the Zoning Administrator and shall be available as a public record.
Section 4-3. Variances
The variance procedures are intended to provide a narrowly circumscribed means by which relief may be
granted from the strict applications of this Ordinance that may result in practical difficulties or
unnecessary hardships. Where relief may be more appropriately remedied, if at all, pursuant to other
provisions of this Ordinance, the variance procedure is inappropriate.
1. Authority
The Board of Zoning Appeals may authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the terms of
this Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest and where, owing to special
conditions, a strict application of the provisions of this Ordinance would result in practical
difficulty or unnecessary hardships.

The owner or lessee of a property or other person having a legal or equitable interest in the
subject property may file with the Zoning Administrator an application for variance.

interested parties who must be sent notice.
D. Action by Board of Zoning Appeals

welfare of the community;
(b) the use and value of the area adjacent to the property included in the variance will not
AVON ZONING ORDINANCE
Town of Avon, Indiana 6. Town Ordinance 2002-14
be affected in a substantially adverse manner;
(c) the need for the variance arises from some condition peculiar to the property involved;
(d) the strict application of the terms of the zoning ordinance will constitute an
unnecessary hardship if applied to the property for which the variance is sought; and
(e) the approval does not interfere substantially with the comprehensive plan for the Town
of Avon

welfare of the community;

concerning the use, construction, character, location, landscaping, screening, and other matters
relating to the purposes and objectives of this Ordinance. Such conditions shall be expressly set
forth in the order granting the variance. Violation of any such condition shall be a violation of this
Ordinance and subject to the provisions of Chapter 19, (Enforcement). In addition to prescribing
supplementary conditions, the Board of Zoning Appeals may require the owner of the subject
property to make written commitments concerning the use or development of the property.
7. Effect of Grant of Variance
The grant of a variance shall not authorize the establishment or extension of any use nor the
development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but
shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any permits and
approvals that may be required by this Ordinances and other ordinances of the Town of Avon.
8. Limitations on Variances
A variance shall be deemed to authorize only the particular construction or development for
which it was issued and shall automatically expire and cease to be of any force or effect if such
construction or development is beyond the scope so authorized.
9. Expiration of Grant
No variance shall be valid for a period longer than twelve (12) months unless an improvement
location permit is issued and construction is actually begun and diligently pursued to completion
thereafter. For good cause shown, the Zoning Administrator may extend this time period up to
twelve (12) additional months.

impact upon the immediate area, as well as the Town as a whole, require a greater degree of scrutiny and
review of site characteristics and impacts to determine their suitability in a given location. Therefore, the
determination of a Special Exception as appropriate shall be contingent upon its meeting a set of
development standards.

4. Standards for Special Exceptions
A. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall review the particular facts and circumstances of each
proposed special exception in terms of the following standards and shall find adequate

(c) will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity
or substantially diminish or impair property values within the specific zoning district;
(d) will be served adequately by essential public facilities and services such as highways,
streets, police and fire protection, drainage structures, refuse disposal, water and sewer,
and schools; or that the persons or agencies responsible for the establishment of the
proposed special exception shall be able to provide adequately any such services;
(e) will not create excessive additional requirements at public expense for public facilities
and services, nor be detrimental to the economic welfare of the community or result in
the destruction, loss, or damage of a natural, scenic, or historic feature of major importance;

Special Exception that would have authorized substantially the same for all or part of the
site, unless the Board determines that conditions in the area have substantially changed.

making its decision, may take into consideration, the extent to which the following facts,
favorable to the applicant, have been established by the evidence.

public services, provides adequate control over vehicular traffic, provides for and protects
designated common open space and furthers the amenities of light and air, recreation and

the Comprehensive Plan.
5. Supplementary Conditions and Safeguards

concerning the use, construction, character, location, landscaping, screening, and other matters
relating to the purposes and objectives of this Ordinance. Such conditions shall be expressly set
forth in the order granting the special exception. Violation of any such condition shall be a
violation of this Ordinance and subject to the provisions of Chapter 19, (Enforcement). In
addition to prescribing supplementary conditions, the Board of Zoning Appeals may require the
owner of the subject property to make written commitments concerning the use or development
of the property.
AVON ZONING ORDINANCE
Town of Avon, Indiana 9. Town Ordinance 2002-14
6. No Presumption of Approval
The listing of a special exception within each zoning district shall not constitute an assurance or
presumption that such special exception will be approved. Rather, each proposed special
exception shall be evaluated on an individual basis, in relation to its compliance with the
standards and conditions set forth herein and with the development standards for the district in
which it is to be located.
7. Limitations on Special Exceptions
A special exception permit shall be deemed to authorize only the particular use at the particular

for a period of twelve (12) months.
8. Effect of Approval

Section 4-7. Interpretations
The interpretation authority established herein is intended to recognize that the provisions of this
Ordinance, though detailed and extensive, cannot, as a practical matter, address every specific situation to
which they may have to be applied. Many such situations can be readily addressed by an interpretation of
the specific provisions of this Ordinance in light of the general and specific purposes for which those
provisions have been enacted. Because the interpretation authority established is an administrative rather
than a legislative authority, it is not intended to add to or change the essential content of this Ordinance
but is intended only to allow authoritative application of that content to specific cases.
1. Authority
The Zoning Administrator, subject to the procedures, standards, and limitations of this Section
AVON ZONING ORDINANCE
Town of Avon, Indiana 13. Town Ordinance 2002-14
may, by written order, render interpretations of the provisions of this Ordinance and of any rule or
regulation issued pursuant to it.
2. Parties Entitled to Seek Interpretations
The owner or lessee of a property or other person having a legal or equitable interest in the
subject property may file with the Zoning Administrator an application for interpretation.
Application for interpretations shall not be accepted for solely hypothetical circumstances or
where the interpretation would have no affect other than as an advisory opinion.
3. Procedure for Review and Decision
A. Application
Applications for an interpretation shall be filed in accordance with the requirements of
Chapter 3 (Applications & Hearings).
B. Action on Application
Within ten (10) business days following the receipt of a properly completed application for
interpretation, the Zoning Administrator shall inform the applicant in writing of his
interpretation, stating the specific precedent, reasons, and analysis upon which the
determination is based.
C. Records
A record of all applications for interpretations shall be kept on file in the office of the Zoning
Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall keep an up-to-date listing of his decisions, by
address, regarding the applications for interpretation. Such listing shall be part of the public
record.
D. Appeal
Appeals from interpretations rendered by the Zoning Administrator may be taken to the
Board of Zoning Appeals pursuant to Section 4-5 of this Chapter.
4. Standards for Interpretations
The following standards shall govern the Zoning Administrator, and the Board of Zoning Appeals
on appeals from the Zoning Administrator, in issuing interpretations.
A. Any term defined in Chapter 20 (Definitions) of this Ordinance shall be interpreted as therein
defined;
B. No interpretation shall permit any use in any zoning district unless evidence shall be
presented that demonstrates that the use will comply with the general district regulations
established for that particular zoning district;
C. No interpretation shall permit any use in a particular zoning district unless such use is
determined to be substantially similar to other uses permitted in the particular zoning district;
D. Where a proposed use is most similar to a use permitted only as a special exception, then any
interpretation permitting such use shall be conditioned on the issuance of a special exception
permit for such use pursuant to Section 4-3 of this Chapter; and
E. No interpretation shall permit the establishment of any use that would be inconsistent with
the statement of purpose of the zoning district in question.
5. Effect of Favorable Interpretations
No interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or permitted as a special exception shall
authorize the establishment of such use nor the development, construction, reconstruction,
alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation,
filing, and processing of applications for any permits and approvals that may be required by this
Ordinance and ordinances of the Town.
AVON ZONING ORDINANCE
Town of Avon, Indiana 14. Town Ordinance 2002-14
6. Limitations on Interpretations
Subject to an extension of time granted by the Zoning Administrator, no use interpretation shall
be valid for a period longer than twelve (12) months from the date of issue. A use interpretation
finding a use to be either permitted or a special exception shall apply only to the particular use for
which it was issued.

certain designated zoning districts, the review and approval of a development plan is required

_____________________________________________________________________________
Section 5-1. Purpose
The Planned Unit Development (PUD) zoning district is established to provide for the development of
mixed zoning classifications, densities, and uses under a common classification when presented to the
Plan Commission in a well-prepared, organized and documented plan. This zoning district is intended to
provide for:
1. Greater flexibility in applying the ordinances to mixed zoning classifications;
2. Innovative approaches to meet the demands of the housing, commercial, and business markets;
3. The recognition of the interdependency of the above markets; and
4. The planning and development of mixed zoning classifications to be consistent with the best
interest of the jurisdictional area of the Town and the applicable Town ordinances.
Section 5-2. Authority to Vary Regulations
In connection with approving a Planned Unit Development District, the Plan Commission and the Town
Council shall have the authority to approve a Planned Unit Development District that varies from the
provisions of this Zoning Ordinance or of the Subdivision Control Ordinance provided, however, such
variation:
1. will achieve the purposes for which planned unit developments may be approved pursuant to the
requirements of this Chapter;
2. will not violate the general purposes, goals, and objectives of the Zoning Ordinance and the
Town’s Comprehensive Plan;
3. will not unduly burden adjacent roadways; and
4. will result in a development providing adequate and appropriate levels of open space and other
compensating amenities both within the proposed development and to the Town.
Section 5-3. Ownership & Control
The properties subject to any Planned Unit Development request must either be under single ownership or
control, or must demonstrate consent to inclusion in the PUD request if not under a single ownership or
control.
Properties under multiple ownership or control may be subject to a Planned Unit Development request,
AVON ZONING ORDINANCE
Town of Avon, Indiana 3 Town Ordinance 2010-02
provided:

during the PUD process until the approved PUD ordinance and any commitments are recorded with the
title to the property.

Commission in accordance with the procedures of Chapter 3 of the Avon Zoning Ordinance.
Section 5-4. Minimum Project Area
1. There shall be no minimum project acreage for a Planned Unit Development District.
2. There shall be no minimum open space requirement for a Planned Unit Development District.
A. As the provision of a per-determined percentage of total project open space (as defined by the
Avon Zoning Ordinance) does not necessarily result in the development of an innovative or
unique project, each proposed PUD zoning district shall instead provide: amenities, recreation
areas, open areas, preservation areas, improvements and features at a level consistent with the
intent and character of the proposed PUD zoning district.
Section 5-5. Permitted Uses & PUD Classifications
All land use classifications that are allowed in this Ordinance may be permitted
within a PUD, unless otherwise omitted. All various types of development, i.e., residential, commercial
or industrial shall meet the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance as they apply to those classifications.
1. Planned Unit Development – Residential (PUD-R)
A. Permitted uses may include any use allowed in any Residential zoning district, and all uses
ancillary to residential character.

A. Permitted uses may included those allowed in any Commercial zoning district, any Industrial
Zoning District, and all uses ancillary to Commercial or Industrial character.
3. Planned Unit Development – Mixed (PUD-M)
A. Permitted uses may include any use allowed in any Residential, Commercial, or Industrial

CHAPTER 6. NONCONFORMING LOTS, USES AND STRUCTURES
_____________________________________________________________________________
Section 6-1. Purpose
Section 6-2. General Standards
Section 6-3. Nonconforming Lots
Section 6-4. Nonconforming Uses
Section 6-5. Nonconforming Structures
Section 6-6. Nonconforming Signs
Section 6-7. Nonconforming Lighting
_____________________________________________________________________________
Section 6-1. Purpose
The purpose of this Chapter is to provide for the regulation of legal nonconforming lots, uses, and
structures and to specify those circumstances and conditions under which they may remain until they are
removed. The zoning districts established by this Ordinance are designed to control the future use of land
within the Town by encouraging the development and maintenance of desirable residential, business,
office, and industrial areas, as well as to promote and protect the public health, safety, and general
welfare. The continued existence of nonconforming lots, uses and structures is frequently inconsistent
with the purposes for which such districts were established and thus the gradual elimination of such
nonconforming lots, uses and structures has been determined by the Avon Town Council to be desirable.
Section 6-2. General Standards.
1. Avoidance of Undue Hardship
Nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or
designated use of any building, structure, or development on which construction was lawfully
begun prior to the effective date of this Ordinance and upon which construction has actually
begun and has been diligently pursued. Where demolition or removal of an existing building has
been substantially begun prior to rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be
construction.
2. Restoration of Structures to Safe Conditions
Nothing in this Article shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe
condition of any building or structure, or part thereof, declared to be unsafe by any official
charged with protecting the public safety. Such strengthening or restoration shall not however, be
used to enlarge, expand or extend such nonconforming building or structure, nor be used as
grounds for adding other structures or uses which are prohibited by this Ordinance.
3. Illegal Uses
Illegal uses and structures existing at the time this Ordinance is enacted shall not be validated by
virtue of its enactment.
4. Variances Previously Granted for Uses and Structures
Any use or structure that becomes nonconforming upon the effective date of this Ordinance and
for which a variance was previously granted, shall remain subject to any conditions that were
imposed pursuant to the granting of such variance.
5. Special Exceptions Previously Granted for Uses and Structures
Any use or structure that becomes nonconforming upon the effective date of this Ordinance and
for which a special exception permit was previously granted, shall remain subject to any
conditions that were imposed pursuant to the granting of such special exception permit.
AVON ZONING ORDINANCE
Town of Avon, Indiana 3. Town Ordinance 2002-14
Section 6-3. Nonconforming Lots
1. Single Nonconforming Lots of Record
In any district a permitted use and its customary accessory uses may be erected on any single lot
of record after the effective date of this Ordinance, notwithstanding limitation imposed by the
provisions of this Ordinance. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous
frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lots
fail to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the
district. Said lots however, shall be required to meet all other lot development standards for the
district in which the lot is located.
2. Lots in Combination
If two (2) or more lots or a combination of lots with continuous frontage and in single ownership
are of record at the effective date of this Ordinance, and if all or part of the lots unimproved do
not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be
considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of meeting the minimum requirements of
this Ordinance. No portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes
compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this Ordinance, nor shall any
division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with width or area below the requirements
stated in this Ordinance.
Section 6-4. Nonconforming Uses
1. Authority to Continue
A lawfully existing nonconforming use may be continued, provided such use adheres to the
limitations set forth herein, as well as the requirements of this Chapter and that such use remains
otherwise lawful.
2. Ordinary Repair and Maintenance
Normal maintenance and incidental repair or replacement, and installation or relocation of
nonbearing walls, nonbearing partitions, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, may be performed on any
structure devoted in whole or in part to a legal nonconforming use. However, this paragraph shall
not be interpreted to authorize an unlawful alteration, enlargement, extension, or move of a
structure.
3. Structural Alteration
A structure devoted in whole or in part to a legal nonconforming use shall not be structurally
altered unless the use thereof shall thereafter conform to the use regulations of the zoning district
in which it is located.
4. Enlargement of Structure
A structure devoted in whole or in part to a legal nonconforming use shall not be enlarged or
added to in any manner, including the addition of interior floor area, unless the use of such
structure shall thereafter conform to the use regulations of the district in which it is located.
5. Extension of Use
A legal nonconforming use shall not be extended, expanded, enlarged or increased in its intensity.
However, a nonconforming use located in a structure manifestly designed or intended for such
use may be extended throughout any interior part of such structure. No such extension shall be
permitted to occupy any land outside of such structure.
6. Moving
A structure devoted in whole or in part to a legal nonconforming use shall not be moved in whole
AVON ZONING ORDINANCE
Town of Avon, Indiana 4. Town Ordinance 2002-14
or in part, for any distance whatsoever, to any other location on the same or any other lot, unless
the entire structure and its use shall thereafter be conforming to the regulations of the zoning
district in which it is located.
7. Change in Use
A legal nonconforming use shall not be changed to any use other than a use permitted in the
zoning district in which the use is located. When such a legal nonconforming use has been
changed to a permitted use, it shall not thereafter be changed back to any nonconforming use.
8. Damage or Destruction
A structure devoted in whole or in part to, or accessory to, a legal nonconforming use that is
damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of the cost of
replacement of such structure new shall not be restored unless the use of such structure shall
thereafter conform to the use regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
9. Termination by Discontinuance or Abandonment
A. When a legal nonconforming use is discontinued or abandoned for a period of twelve (12)
months, such use shall not thereafter be reestablished or resumed. Any subsequent use or
occupancy of such land or structure shall comply with the use regulations of the zoning
district in which such land or structure is located.
B. Where a period of discontinuance is caused by government action, strikes, material shortages,
or acts of God, and without any contributing fault of the owner, occupant or agents thereof,
such period shall not be considered in calculating the length of discontinuance for purposes of
this paragraph.
Section 6-5. Nonconforming Structures
1. Authority to Continue
A lawfully existing nonconforming structure may be continued provided such structure adheres to
the limitations set forth herein as well as the requirements of this Chapter and that such structure
remains otherwise lawful.
2. Repair, Maintenance, Alterations, and Enlargement
A legal nonconforming structure may be repaired, maintained, altered, or enlarged provided,
however, that no such repair, maintenance, alteration, or enlargement shall either create any new
nonconformity or increase the degree of the existing nonconformity of all or any part of such
structure. For the purposes of this regulation, the vertical or horizontal extension of a structure
shall be considered to increase the degree of an existing nonconformity related to a required yard
or setback.
3. Moving
A legal nonconforming structure shall not be moved in whole or in part, for any distance
whatsoever, to any other location on the same or any other lot unless the entire structure shall
thereafter conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
4. Damage or Destruction
Except for single family dwellings, any legal nonconforming structure that is damaged or
destroyed to the extent of more than fifty percent (50%) of the cost of replacement of such
structure new shall not be restored unless the structure shall thereafter conform to the regulations
of the zoning district in which it is located. This regulation however, shall not be interpreted to
authorize the creation of a new nonconformity or increase the degree of any nonconformity
existing prior to such damage or destruction.

_____________________________________________________________________________
Section 7-1. Establishment of Districts.
In order to classify, regulate and restrict the location of specified uses, and to regulate and limit the height
and bulk of buildings for those uses, the Town of Avon, Indiana, is hereby divided into the following
districts.
1. Residential Districts
A. E-1 Single Family Estate District
B. R-1 Single Family Residential District
C. R-2 Single Family Residential District
D. R-3 Single Family Residential District
E. R-4 Multiple Family Residential District
F. R-5 Multiple Family Residential District
2. MH-1 Mobile Home Park District
3. Commercial Districts

B. I-2 Light Industrial District
C. I-3 Heavy Industrial District
D. I-4 Industrial Park District
6. Other Districts
A. Planned Unit Development Districts
B. AGO-1 Agricultural Overlay District
Section 7-2. Interpretation of District Sequence
1. General Rule
This Ordinance rejects as outdated and inappropriate, the concept of cumulative zoning districts,
where each district builds off of the uses of the less intense districts. Except as noted below, this
Ordinance is based on the concept that each district should be designed to accomplish a specific
purpose, to encourage a particular type of development, and to protect that development from
being encroached upon by incompatible types of development.
2. Special Rule
AVON ZONING ORDINANCE
Town of Avon, Indiana 3. Town Ordinance 2002-14
Within the foregoing philosophy, however, it is recognized that, when different districts are side
by side, their differing characters may require special treatment to diminish incompatibilities that
might otherwise result. For this limited purpose, this Ordinance recognizes the concept of "more
restrictive" and "less restrictive" districts, and the districts established by this Ordinance shall be
considered "more restrictive" or "less restrictive" in accordance with the following rules:
A. the residential districts shall be deemed to be more restrictive than any nonresidential district;
B. the E-1 Single Family Residential District shall be deemed to be the most restrictive
residential district and the R-5 Multiple Family Residential District shall be deemed to be the
least restrictive Residential District, and the residential districts shall be deemed to become
less restrictive as the district number increases;
C. the MH-1 Mobile Home Park District shall be more restrictive than any nonresidential district
but less restrictive than any residential district;
D. the commercial districts shall be deemed to become less restrictive as the district number
increases except that the C-4 Transitional Office District shall be deemed more restrictive
than the C-2 General Commercial District but less restrictive than the C-1 Neighborhood
Commercial District;
E. the SC Shopping Center Commercial District shall be deemed to be less restrictive than the
other commercial districts but more restrictive than the industrial districts;
F. the Planned Unit Development Districts shall be deemed to stand alone and may be fashioned
to be less or more restrictive than other districts;
G. the industrial districts shall be deemed to become less restrictive as the district number
increases except that the I-4 Industrial Park District shall be deemed more restrictive than the
I-2 Light Industrial District but less restrictive than the I-1 transitional Industrial District; and
H. the I-3 Heavy Industrial District shall be deemed to be less restrictive than any other district.
Section 7-3. Annexed Land
Where land is to be annexed into the Town of Avon, the Town Council may direct the Plan Commission
to make a recommendation on the appropriate zoning district classification for the property that the
Council is considering for annexation. In such circumstances, the Plan Commission shall follow the
process for amendments to the Zoning Map set forth in Chapter 4, Section 4-6 of this Ordinance. Town
Council action on the Plan Commission’s recommendation shall be scheduled in conjunction with the
Town Council’s adoption of the annexation ordinance.
1. Should the Town council annex land without adopting an amendment to the Zoning Map
establishing the appropriate zoning district classification for the property, the property shall retain
the zoning classification assigned to it by Hendricks County, as shown on its Official Zoning
Map. If the Avon Zoning Ordinance does not have the same zoning classification as Hendricks
County, the property will have the zoning district classification of the Avon Zoning Ordinance
that is the closest to the classification assigned to it by Hendricks County. The Zoning
Administrator shall be responsible for identifying the zoning district classification for property
annexed under this paragraph.
Section 7-4. Official Zoning Map
1. Map Incorporated
The location and boundaries of the zoning districts established by this Ordinance shall be shown
on the Official Zoning Map. The Official Zoning Map shall be identified by certification by and
bearing the seal of the Town of Avon under the following words:
“THIS IS TO CERTIFY THAT THIS IS THE OFFICIAL ZONING MAP REFERRED TO IN
CHAPTER 7 OF ORDINANCE #2002-14 OF THE TOWN OF AVON, INDIANA, ADOPTED

water areas, be included in the districts established by this Ordinance. Any area lying within the
Town but not shown on the Official Zoning Map as being included in a district shall be deemed to
be, and is hereby classified as being, within the E-1 Single Family Residential District.
3. Maintenance and Availability of Official Zoning Map
The official copy of the Zoning Map shall be maintained by the Zoning Administrator and shall
be available for public inspection during Town business hours at the Town Hall.
4. Amendments to Map

Secretary of the Plan Commission. No amendments shall be made on the Official Zoning Map
except in conformance with procedures set for in Chapter 4, Section 4-6 (Amendments).
5. Reproduction of Zoning Map
A revised, up-to-date copy of the official Zoning Map, certified as being inclusive of all
amendments and drawn to a convenient scale, shall be published from time to time and made
available for sale.
6. Replacement of the Official Zoning Map
In the event that the Official Zoning Map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to
interpret because of the nature or number of changes and additions, the Town Council may, by
resolution, adopt a new Official Zoning Map that shall supersede the prior Official Zoning Map.
The new Official Zoning Map may correct drafting errors or other errors or omissions in the prior
Official Zoning Map, but no correction shall have the effect of amending the Official Zoning
Map. The new Official Zoning Map shall be identified by the signature of the President of the
Town Council and attested by the Clerk-Treasurer and shall bear the seal of the Town of Avon
under the following words:
“THIS IS TO CERTIFY THAT THIS OFFICIAL ZONING MAP SUPERSEDES AND
REPLACES THE OFFICIAL ZONING MAP ADOPTED ON THE 14th DAY OF NOVEMBER
2002 BY ORDINANCE #2002-14 OF THE TOWN OF AVON, INDIANA, ADOPTED ON
THE __ DAY OF _______ 200_.”
Unless the prior Official Zoning Map has been lost, or has been totally destroyed, the prior map
or any significant parts remaining shall be preserved, together with all available records
pertaining to its adoption or amendment.
Section 7-5. Interpretation of District Boundaries
Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the Official Zoning Map, the
following rules shall apply.
1. Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerline of thoroughfares or highways,
street lines or highway right-of-way lines, or alleys shall be construed to follow such centerlines.

other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such centerlines.
7. Boundaries indicated as approximately following floodplain lines shall be construed to follow
floodplain lines.

shall be so construed. Distances not specifically indicated on the Official Zoning Map shall be
determined by the scale on the Map.

the Official Zoning Map, or in other circumstances not covered by the subparagraphs above, the
Board of Zoning Appeals shall interpret the location of district boundaries.

Section 13-1. Lots
1. Number of Buildings on a Lot
Except in the case of a unified development located in a C-4 Office District, I-4 Industrial Park
District, or SC Shopping Center District, no more than one principal use and no more than one
principal building may be located on a single lot of record or a single zoning lot.
2. Division of Lots
No lot shall hereafter be divided into two or more lots for the
purpose of transfer of ownership, unless the division shall
conform to the applicable regulations of the Subdivision
Control Ordinance and this Ordinance.
3. Corner Lots
On a corner lot, both lot lines abutting on a street shall be
considered front lot lines, and the required front yard setback
on corner lots shall apply to each side of the lot facing a
street. The remaining sides of the lot shall be considered
side lot lines, and the required side yard setback on corner
lots shall apply to each side of the lot not facing a street.
4. Street Frontage and Access
A. Every lot must have frontage on a public street or permitted private access drive and must be
provided with facilities (traffic access points) for ingress and egress to and from such street or
drive. The number of facilities for ingress and egress for lots having one hundred (100) feet
or less of frontage shall not exceed one (1), provided that each multi-family development,
regardless of size, shall have an additional point of ingress and egress for emergency access.
For lots having more than one hundred (100) feet of frontage, the number of facilities for
ingress and egress shall be at the determination of the Plan Commission. Any request for
more than one point of ingress and egress onto any public street shall require the submittal of
a traffic study.
B. Private access drives shall only be permitted where, because of unusual site conditions, full
AVON ZONING ORDINANCE
Town of Avon, Indiana 3. Town Ordinance 2002-14
compliance with the requirement for frontage on a public street would prevent reasonable
access to the area. As used in this section, “unusual site conditions” shall include, but not be
limited to, lots with acreage sufficient for development but with limited road frontage, and
lots which currently do not have frontage on a public street. As used in this section, a lot
shall be considered to not have “reasonable access” if access through a dedicated public street
would result in a physical or financial hardship, thereby making the site prohibitive for
development.
C. Private access drives shall meet the following requirements.
(a) Private access drives shall provide access only to commercial and industrial lots.
(b) Private access drives shall provide access only to abutting lots and shall be allowed
only for such drives that have no public interest for traffic circulation.
(c) Private access drives shall not be created to provide access to more than three lots.
(d) The design and improvement of private access drives shall be to the same standards as
those for public roads providing access to similar development and shall adhere to all
provisions of the Subdivision Control Ordinance of the Town of Avon for public roads.
5. Lot Area Exclusions
Any portion of a lot located within the 100-year floodplain or floodway, within wetlands, lakes,
ponds, areas used for storm water detention, or areas used for floodplain compensatory storage,
may not be counted towards the minimum lot area.
6. Yards, Courts, and other Open Spaces on Lots
A. Open Spaces
The provisions of yards, courts, and other open spaces and minimum lot area legally required
for a building shall be a continuing obligation of the owner of such building or property on
which it is located, as long as the building or property is in existence. Furthermore, no legally
required yards, courts, or other open space, or minimum lot area allocated to any building,
shall by virtue of change of ownership, or for any other reason, be used to satisfy yard, court,
or other open space or minimum lot area requirements for any other building.
B. Location of Required Yards, Courts, and other Open Space
All yards, courts, and other open space allocated to a building or group of buildings shall be
located on the same zoning lots as such building or group of buildings.
C. Yards for Existing Buildings
No yard now or hereafter provided for a building existing on the effective date of this
Ordinance shall subsequently be reduced below, or further reduced if already less than, the
minimum yard requirement of this Ordinance for
equivalent new construction.
7. Vision Clearance Areas
No building, structure or improvement, including
landscaping, shall be erected, placed, planted or
maintained so as to interfere with a vision clearance
area located between the heights of two and one half (2
½) feet and nine (9) feet above the crown of a street,
driveway or alley. A vision clearance area shall be
established for all streets whether public or private, in
one of the following manners:
A. on a corner lot, the clear sight triangular area is
formed by the street right-of-way lines and the

from the intersection of such streets’ right-of-way lines, or in case of a round or cut property
corner, from the intersection of the street right-of-way lines extended; or
B. on a lot adjacent to an at-grade railroad crossing, the clear sight triangular area is formed by
the side lot line sharing a boundary with the railroad right-of-way, the street right-of-way
line, and the diagonal line connecting points measured twenty-five (25) feet from the
intersection of such lines, or
C. on a lot which has a driveway, abuts an alley or which is next to a lot which has a driveway,
the two clear sight triangular areas are formed by the street right-of-way line, both sides of
either the alley right-of-way or of the surface edge of the driveway, and the diagonal line
connecting points measured (10) feet from the intersection of the street right-of-way line and
driveway or alley lines extended.
D. Where no right-of-way line has been determined, a line parallel to the property line, drawn at
a distance of thirty (30) feet from the edge of pavement, shall be used in place of the right-ofway
line in the equations above.

of practical necessity for the applicant. A diligent effort shall require that all owners of
potentially suitable structures within a one-quarter (1/4) mile radius of the proposed Wireless
Communications Tower site be contacted and that one (1) or more of the following reasons
for not selecting such structure apply:
(a) The proposed antennas and related equipment would exceed the structural capacity of
the existing structure and its reinforcement could not be accomplished at a reasonable
cost.
(b) The proposed antennas and related equipment would cause radio frequency interference
with other existing equipment for that existing structure and the interference could not
be prevented at a reasonable cost.
(c) Such existing structures do not have adequate location, space, access or height to
accommodate the proposed equipment or to allow it to perform its intended function.
(d) Addition of the proposed antennas and related equipment would result in

_____________________________________________________________________________
Section 16-1. Purpose
The landscaping and screening requirements specified herein are intended to foster developments that will
protect and preserve the appearance, character, health, safety, and welfare of the community. Specifically,
these regulations are intended to increase the compatibility of adjacent uses, and, in doing so, minimize
the harmful impact of noise, dust and other debris, motor vehicle headlight glare or other artificial light
intrusions, and other objectionable activities or impacts conducted or created by adjoining or nearby uses.
Section 16-2. Enforcement of Landscaping Requirements
Wherever a landscape plan is required by this Ordinance, such plan shall become an integral part of any
development review application. No improvement location permit shall be issued without first obtaining
approval of a required landscape plan; and all plantings shall be installed as a condition on obtaining a
Final Certificate of Occupancy. Temporary Certificates of Occupancy may be issued should weather
conditions or planting seasons hinder the installation of the plant material. Failure to implement an
approved landscape plan shall be deemed a violation of this Ordinance and subject to the procedures of
Chapter 19 (Enforcement).
Section 16-3. Landscape Plan
A landscape plan shall be required for any development or redevelopment that requires development plan
review pursuant to Section 4-8 (Development Plans). The Zoning Administrator may also require a
landscape plan as part of a site plan required for the issuance of an improvement location permit. All
landscape plans shall be prepared in conformance with the requirements of this Chapter.
1. Content of Landscape Plan
All landscape plans submitted for review and approval shall contain or have attached thereto the
following information.
A. The location and dimension of all existing and proposed structures, parking lots and drives,
roadways and rights of way, sidewalks, bicycle paths, ground signs, refuse disposal areas,
bicycle parking areas, fences, freestanding electrical equipment, tot lots and other recreational
AVON ZONING ORDINANCE
Town of Avon, Indiana 3. Town Ordinance 2002-14
facilities, and other freestanding structural features as determined necessary by the Zoning
Administrator.
B. The location, quantity, size and name, both botanical and common, of all proposed planting
materials at time of planting and the location, quantity, size and name, both botanical and
common, of all existing planting materials that are of a protective size according to Section
16-8 as well as all plant materials to be retained.
C. The location of existing buildings, structures and plant materials on adjacent property within
twenty feet of the site.
D. Existing and proposed grading of the site, including proposed berming, indicating contours, at
two (2) foot intervals.
E. Specification of the type and boundaries of all proposed ground cover, including grass.
F. Elevations of all fences proposed for location on site and an indication of material to be used.
G. Elevations, cross sections, and other details as determined necessary by the Zoning
Administrator.
H. A legend, scale and north arrow.
Section 16-4. Selection, Installation and Maintenance of Plant Materials
1. Selection
All planting materials used shall be of good quality, and capable of withstanding the climate
extremes of central Indiana, as well as, an individual site’s microclimate. Size and density of
plant material, both at the time of planting and at maturity, are additional criteria that shall be
considered when selecting plant materials. The use of drought tolerant plant material is preferred.
The use of salt tolerant plant material is required for landscaping near streets and other rights-ofway.
2. Installation
All landscaping materials shall be installed in accordance with the current planting procedures
established by the American Association of Nurserymen. The installation of all plant material
required by this Chapter may be delayed until the next optimal planting season, as determined by
the Zoning Administrator.
3. Maintenance
All landscaping materials shall be maintained in good condition so as to present a healthy and
orderly appearance, and plant material not in this condition shall be replaced when necessary and
shall be kept free of refuse and debris. The owner of the premises shall guarantee all plant
material to live for one year and shall provide the Town with a maintenance bond to that effect in
an amount to be determined by the Zoning Administrator. The owner shall be responsible for the
maintenance, repair, and replacement of all failed landscaping materials. Irrigation systems, if
needed, shall be maintained in good operating condition to promote the health of the plant
materials and the conservation of water. The replacement of all failed landscaping materials shall
be done within six (6) months of a determination by the Zoning Administrator that a plant is dead
or severely damaged or diseased, or within the next planting season, whichever is earlier.
Section 16-5. Design Standards and Guidelines
Landscape plans shall be prepared based on the following design standards and guidelines. Design
standards are numerically measurable and can be definitively evaluated for compliance, however, design
guidelines are not precisely measurable and therefore, compliance shall be evaluated based on
appropriateness.
AVON ZONING ORDINANCE
Town of Avon, Indiana 4. Town Ordinance 2002-14
1. Design Materials
For the purposes of this Chapter, caliper measurements shall be taken four and one-half (4 ½) feet
above grade. All trees shall be planted at a size that enables them to grow to an average minimum
height of six (6) feet for shade and ornamental trees, and seven (7) feet for evergreens, within two
(2) years, under normal conditions.
A. Shade Trees
All shade trees shall have a minimum trunk size of two and one half (2-1/2) inches in caliper,
unless otherwise specified.
B. Ornamental Trees
All ornamental trees shall have a minimum trunk size of one and one half (1-1/2) inches in
caliper, unless otherwise specified. These trees may be single or multiple trunk specimen
plants providing screening and seasonal interest with attractive fruit, flowers and trunks or
branching. Whenever shade trees are required by the ordinance, ornamentals may be
substituted at a rate of two (2) ornamental trees for each shade tree, unless otherwise
specified.
C. Evergreen Trees
All evergreens shall be a minimum of six (6) feet in height at the time of planting. Whenever
shade or ornamental trees are required by this ordinance, evergreens may be substituted at a
rate of one-half (.5) evergreen for each ornamental tree or one (1) evergreen for each shade
tree, unless otherwise specified. Where evergreens are required by this chapter, ornamentals
and shade trees may not be substituted.
D. Shrubs
All shrubs shall have a minimum height of eighteen (18) inches at planting. Shrubs used to
form hedges shall be of a non-deciduous species and shall be spaced not more than three (3)
feet apart so as to form a continuous visual screen. Where shrubs are required, trees may be
substituted at a rate of one shade or evergreen tree per five (5) shrubs or one (1) ornamental
tree per three (3) shrubs. Shrubs may not be substituted for required trees, unless otherwise
specified.
E. Mounds
Mounds shall have a minimum top width of at least two (2) feet, a maximum side slope for
front and back sides of three (3) feet horizontal to one (1) foot vertical (3:1) and not to exceed
eight (8) feet in height. Mounds shall be set back from the right-of-way line of a street and
the property line of adjoining property so that the toe of the slope is not closer than five (5)
feet from the right-of-way line and/or property line. Mounds shall be set back from retention
and detention areas so that the toe of the slope is not closer than fifteen (15) feet from the top
of bank or high water level of the retention or detention area. The design and location of a
mound shall not interfere with the site triangle district of two or more intersecting streets or
roads.
F. Fences and Walls
Fences and walls shall be, when provided as part of a landscaped treatment, consistent in
shape, character, and placement with other fencing used within the development.
G. Ground Cover
Ground cover shall include living landscape materials or low-growing plants installed in such
a manner so as to provide a continuous cover of the ground surface. Ground cover shall not
exceed six (6) inches in height at maturity. Domestic turf grasses should be used in areas
with little or no slope to prevent the runoff of irrigation water.
AVON ZONING ORDINANCE
Town of Avon, Indiana 5. Town Ordinance 2002-14
H. Prohibited Materials
Gravel and asphalt shall not be considered ground cover for the purposes of this Chapter.
Neither shall rocks and bark be considered ground cover, although such materials may be
permitted as decorative accents.
2. Design Guidelines
A. Scale and Nature of Landscaping Material
The scale and nature of landscaping materials shall be appropriate to the size of the
structures. For example, large scaled plants should complement large scaled buildings.
B. Selection of Plant Material
Plant material shall be selected for its form, texture, color, pattern of growth, and suitability
to local conditions.
C. Evergreens
Evergreens should be incorporated into the landscape treatment of a site and shall be required
whenever a screen or buffer is required to ensure the integrity of such a screen or buffer
through all seasons. Screening referred to in this chapter as “year round” shall consist of
primarily evergreen plants so that the screen remains dense in seasons when deciduous plant
materials have lost their leaves. Furthermore, plant material placement should be designed to
reduce the energy consumption needs of a development.
(a) Deciduous trees should be placed on the south and west sides of buildings to provide
shade from the summer sun.
(b) Evergreens and other plant materials should be concentrated on the north and west
sides of buildings to dissipate the effect of winter winds.
D. Softening of Walls and Fences
Plant material should be placed intermittently against long expanses of building walls,
fences, and other barriers to create a softening effect. This additional plant material shall not
be required when decorative fencing, walls or other barriers with variations in design features
are used, provided that the barrier’s architectural design varies as frequently as once every
twenty (20) feet.
E. Planting Beds
Planting beds should be mulched with bark chips, feather rocks, or similar materials. Mulch
shall not be used as a substitute for plant materials.
F. Detention/Retention Basins and Ponds
Detention/retention basins and ponds shall be landscaped. Such landscaping should include
shade and ornamental trees, evergreens, shrubbery, hedges, turf, groundcover and/or other
plant materials. Where a detention/retention basin abuts a sidewalk, such landscaping shall
also include a fence along any adjacent portion of the basin or pond of at least four (4) feet in
height, and not to exceed the fence height permitted in its zoning district. The type of fence
provided shall be consistent with the types of fences permitted in that zoning district (see
Section 13-5).
G. Water Conservation
Landscape design pursuant to the requirements of this Chapter must recognize the need for
water conservation. While sprinkler irrigation systems are required for certain landscape
areas, and may be desirable for other applications, all irrigation systems shall be designed to
minimize the use of water.
AVON ZONING ORDINANCE
Town of Avon, Indiana 6. Town Ordinance 2002-14

Section 16-10. Parking Lot Landscaping (In All Zoning Districts)
1. Applicability
All parking lots designed for ten (10) or more parking spaces shall provide landscaping in
accordance with the provisions of this Article. Parking lots designed for less than ten (10) parking
spaces shall provide landscaping as may be deemed appropriate by the Zoning Administrator.
2. Interior Parking Lot Landscaping
A. Area Required
AVON ZONING ORDINANCE
Town of Avon, Indiana 11. Town Ordinance 2002-14
Not less than five percent (5%) of the interior of a parking lot shall be devoted to
landscaping. Landscaping areas located along the perimeter of a parking lot beyond the curb
or edge of pavement of the lot shall not be included toward satisfying this requirement.
B. Landscaped Areas
The landscaped areas defined in Subsection A, above, shall be improved as follows:
(a) Location. Interior parking lot landscaping areas (planting islands at least six (6) inches
above the surface of the parking lot) shall be dispersed throughout the parking lot in a
design and configuration that aesthetically corresponds to the size and shape of the
parking lot.
(b) Design of Landscape Areas. Landscape areas which are to be counted towards the
requirements of this section shall follow one or more of the following designs:
(1) Landscaped Islands. Interior landscape islands may be used to meet the
requirement of Section 15-4(5), in which case islands shall be provided at the
terminus of each parking row and once at least every fifteen (15) parking
spaces. Landscape islands which are not terminal islands should be evenly
spaced throughout the parking lot to consistently reduce the visual impact of
long rows of parked cars. Islands should be utilized where needed to control
vehicular circulation and define major drives.
(2) Divider Medians. As an
alternative to landscape
islands, interior parking
areas may be consolidated
into landscaped divider
medians. Divider medians
shall form a continuous
landscaped strip installed
between abutting rows of
parking spaces. Divider
medians, when used shall
occur consistently throughout the entire parking lot.
(c) Curbing. All landscape areas shall be separated from vehicular use areas by concrete
curbing. Roll curbs may not be used for this separation.
(d) Size. Interior parking lot landscaping areas shall be a minimum of one hundred and
thirty (130) square feet in area and shall be a minimum of eight (8) feet in width at their
narrowest point, as measured from back of curb to back of curb.
(e) Landscape Material. The plant material used to improve the landscape areas defined
above shall conform to the following:
(1) Type. The primary plant materials used in parking lots shall be shade tree
species in conformance with applicable provisions of Sections 16-5[1][A]
above. Ornamental trees may be substituted for shade trees as provided
below. Shrubbery, hedges, and other plant materials may be used to
supplement the tree plantings, but shall not be the sole contribution to such
landscaping.
(2) Quantity. One (1) shade tree shall be provided for every three hundred (300)
square feet of landscaping area, provided that each landscape island shall
have a minimum of one shade tree. Ornamental trees may be substituted for
shade trees according to the provisions set forth in Section 16-5.1 (A-D).
(3) Groundcover. A minimum of fifty percent (50%) of every interior parking
lot landscaping area shall be planted with an approved groundcover in the
appropriate density to achieve complete cover within two years. Mulch may
Example of a Divider Median
AVON ZONING ORDINANCE
Town of Avon, Indiana 12. Town Ordinance 2002-14
be substituted for other ground cover if it is applied to the landscaping area
and maintained at a thickness of at least two (2) inches.
3. Perimeter Parking Lot Landscaping.
A. Purpose
Perimeter parking lot landscaping is to provide for the enhancement of parking lots by
requiring a uniform scheme of landscaping along public streets and between adjoining
properties. The perimeter landscaping shall require a higher level of landscaping for
residential uses (principally multiple-family uses) than for non-residential uses. Landscape
areas shall in no way interfere with the vision clearance area as described in Section 13-1(7).
B. Landscape Area
Where perimeter landscaping is required, it shall be provided at least five (5) feet in width as
measured from the back of curb, and excluding any parking space overhang area. Perimeter
landscaping shall be required on all sides of the parking lot that are not immediately adjacent
to the building which the parking lot is serving.
C. Required Improvements
The perimeter landscape area shall provide the following landscape improvements in
combination or individually.
(a) Shade Trees. One (1) tree for every fifty (50) lineal feet of length; however, shade
trees may be clustered based on specific site requirements.
(b) Shrubs. Shrubs, measuring a minimum of eighteen (18) inches at planting and not to
exceed four (4) feet at maturity, clustered or spaced linearly to form a continuous dense
hedge. A shrub hedge shall run the full length of the lot when abutting a residential use
and seventy-five percent (75%) of the lot when abutting a non-residential use.
Evergreen shrub hedges shall be required adjacent to residential properties in order to
limit headlight glare in all seasons.
(c) Wall. A masonry wall having a significant design variation evenly spaced at intervals
of not more than twenty (20) lineal feet.
(d) Groundcover. Landscaped areas outside of tree and/or shrub masses shall be planted in
turf or other groundcover.
Section 16-11. Landscape Buffers
1. Applicability
The regulations of this Section shall establish the dimensions and improvement requirements of
landscape buffers as required for transitions between uses.
2. General Restrictions
Landscape buffers shall be reserved for the planting of material and installation of mounds and
fencing as required within this Section. No parking, driveways, sidewalks, accessory buildings or
other impervious surfaces shall be permitted, unless specifically authorized by, as the case may
be, the Plan Commission or the Zoning Administrator. Landscape buffers in commercial and
industrial districts may be located within required yards or required landscape yards as
established in the applicable district regulations. Landscape buffers in residential districts shall be
in addition to the required yard established by the applicable district regulations. Where both
landscape buffers and parking lot landscaping is required, the more restrictive shall apply. For the
purposes of calculating landscaping requirements, each fraction of a tree shall be counted as one
whole tree.
3. Location of Landscape Buffers
AVON ZONING ORDINANCE
Town of Avon, Indiana 13. Town Ordinance 2002-14
Landscape buffers shall be located on the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel, extending to the lot or
parcel boundary line, except when prohibited by certain easements or road rights-of-way. In such
cases the landscape buffer shall extend to such easement or right-of-way. Landscape buffers shall
run the entire length of the lot line along which they are required.
4. Size and Improvement of Landscape Buffers
The size and improvement of landscape buffers for various situations shall be as follows. Where
a continuous solid screen is required, the frequency of the planting shall accomplish the formation
of a solid visual screen within three years of the date of planting.

create a solid visual screen along the entire yard length. Where a fence is proposed, the
Plan Commission may approve a reduction in the height and width of a buffer yard.
(d) Areas not planted with trees or shrubs shall be maintained as turf or other groundcover.
B. Commercial Districts
Where a lot in a Commercial District abuts a residential district or use, a landscape buffer a
minimum of thirty (30) feet in width shall be provided. The arrangement of plantings in the
buffer yard shall be effective in creating a solid, year round screen that screens to a height of
eight (8) feet. The use of mounding in combination with plantings is encouraged to ensure
that the minimum height is reached within three (3) years of planting. Where mounding is not
used, either dense evergreens or a solid opaque fence shall be used to ensure the screening is
continuous at all times of the year. Within the required landscape buffer, the following
improvements individually or in combination shall be provided.
(a) Evergreen trees or shrubs shall be planted on an average of one (1) tree/shrub for every
thirty (30) feet of the yard length; however, trees/shrubs may be clustered only where
site constraints would prohibit the even distribution of the trees/shrubs. Ornamental or
shade trees may be substituted for evergreen trees according to the provisions set forth
in Section 16-5.1 (A-D), only when the result would be sufficient to provide a solid,
year round screen to the height of eight (8) feet.
(b) Mounding, with a minimum top width of at least two (2) feet, a maximum side slope
for front and back sides of three (3) feet horizontal to one (1) foot vertical (3:1). Such

create a solid visual screen along the entire yard length. Where a fence is proposed, the
Plan Commission may approve a reduction in the height and width of a buffer yard.
(d) Areas not planted with trees or shrubs shall be maintained as turf or other groundcover.
C. Industrial Districts
Where a lot in a Industrial District abuts a residential district or use, a landscape buffer forty
(40) feet in width shall be provided. The arrangement of plantings in the buffer yard shall be
effective in creating a solid year-round screen that screens to a height of eight (8) feet. The
use of mounding in combination with plantings is encouraged to ensure that the minimum
height is reached within three (3) years of planting. Where mounding is not used, either
dense evergreens or a solid opaque fence shall be used to ensure the screening is continuous
at all times of the year. Within the required landscape buffer, the following improvements,
individually or in combination, shall be provided.
(a) Evergreen trees or shrubs shall be planted on an average of one (1) tree/shrub for every
thirty (30) feet of the yard length; however, trees/shrubs may be clustered only where

_____________________________________________________________________________
Section 17-1. Findings of Fact
1. The flood hazard areas of the Town of Avon are subject to periodic inundation which results in
loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the
tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
2. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing
increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses
vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed,
or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
Section 17-2. Statement of Purpose
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize
public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or
erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
2. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
3. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers
which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;
4. Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood
damage;
5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or
which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and,
6. Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the Town
of Avon by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.
Section 17-3. Objectives
The objectives of this chapter are:
1. To protect human life and health;
2. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
3. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public;
4. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
AVON ZONING ORDINANCE
Town of Avon, Indiana 3. Town Ordinance 2002-14
5. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric,
telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in floodplains;
6. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone
areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, and;
7. To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
Section 17-4. General Provisions
1. Lands to Which This Chapter Applies
This chapter shall apply to all SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the Town of Avon.
2. Basis for Establishing Regulatory Flood Data
This chapter’s protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best available regulatory flood
data is listed below. Whenever a party disagrees with the best available data, the party submitting
the detailed engineering study needs to replace existing data with better data and submit it to the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and approval.
A. The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for the studied SFHAs of the
Town of Avon shall be as delineated on the 100 year flood profiles in the Flood Insurance
Study of Hendricks County and Incorporated Areas and the corresponding FIRM prepared by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated September 25, 2009.
B. The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for each of the unstudied SFHAs
of Town of Avon delineated as an "A Zone" on the FIRM of Hendricks County and
Incorporated Areas shall be according to the best data available as provided by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources.
3. Establishment of Floodplain Development Permit
A Floodplain Development Permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this
chapter prior to the commencement of any development activities in areas of special flood hazard.
4. Compliance
No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or structurally altered within the
SFHA without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations.
No land or stream within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered without full compliance with the
terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations.
5. Discrepancy between Mapped Floodplain and Actual Ground Elevations
A. In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain (SFHA) on the FIRM
and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on the profiles shall govern.
B. If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood elevation, that site shall be
included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
C. If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above the base flood elevation, that
site shall be considered outside the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be applied.
The property owner should be advised to apply for a LOMA.
6. Interpretation
In the interpretation and application of this chapter all provisions shall be:
A. Considered as minimum requirements;
B. Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
C. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.
AVON ZONING ORDINANCE
Town of Avon, Indiana 4. Town Ordinance 2002-14
7. Warning and Disclaimer of Liability
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific methods
of study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this ordinance does not
create any liability on the part of the Town of Avon, the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources, or the State of Indiana, for any flood damage that results from reliance on this
ordinance or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.
8. Penalties for Violation
Failure to obtain a Floodplain Development Permit in the SFHA or failure to comply with the
requirements of a Floodplain Development Permit or conditions of a variance shall be deemed to
be a violation of this chapter. All violations of this chapter shall be treated in accordance with the
provisions of Chapter 19: Enforcement, and subject to all remedies contained therein.
A. A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the violation continues to exist.
B. The Zoning Administrator shall inform the owner that any such violation is considered a
willful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause coverage by a Standard Flood
Insurance Policy to be suspended.
C. Nothing herein shall prevent the Town of Avon from taking such other lawful action to
prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith, including attorney’s fees,
shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.
9. Increased Cost of Compliance (ICC)
In order for buildings to qualify for a claim payment under ICC coverage as a “repetitive loss
structure”, the National Reform Act of 1994 requires that the building be covered by a contract
for flood insurance and incur flood-related damages on two occasions during a 10-year period
ending on the date of the event for which the second claim is made, in which the cost of repairing
the flood damage, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25 percent of the market value of the
building at the time of each such flood event.
Section 17-5. Administration

with the provisions of this chapter shall meet the requirements of “new construction” as
contained in this chapter; and,
J. Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure that is not in compliance
with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only if said non-conformity is not
further, extended, or replaced.
2. Specific Standards
In all SFHAs, the following provisions are required:
A. In addition to the requirements of Section 17-6(1), all structures to be located in the SFHA
shall be protected from flood damage below the FPG. This building protection requirement
applies to the following situations:
(a) Construction or placement of any new structure having a floor area greater than 400
square feet;
(b) Addition or improvement made to any existing structure:
(1) where the cost of the addition or improvement equals or exceeds 50% of the
value of the existing structure (excluding the value of the land);
(2) with a previous addition or improvement constructed since the community’s
first floodplain ordinance.
(c) Reconstruction or repairs made to a damaged structure where the costs of restoring the
structure to its before damaged condition equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of
the structure (excluding the value of the land) before damage occurred;
(d) Installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle on a site for more than 180 days;

(f) Reconstruction or repairs made to a repetitive loss structure.
B. Residential Construction
New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure (or manufactured
home) shall have the lowest floor; including basement, at or above the FPG (two feet above
the base flood elevation). Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a
structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be
provided in accordance with the standards of Section 17-6(2)(D).
C. Non-Residential Construction
New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or nonresidential
structure (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated to or above the FPG (two feet above the base flood elevation). Structures located in
all “A Zones” may be floodproofed in lieu of being elevated if done in accordance with the

Town of Avon, Indiana 8. Town Ordinance 2002-14
watertight and capable of resisting the effects of the regulatory flood. The structure
design shall take into account flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic
pressures, and impacts from debris or ice. Such certification shall be provided to the
official as set forth in Section 17-5(3)(J).
(b) Floodproofing measures shall be operable without human intervention and without an
outside source of electricity.
D. Elevated Structures
New construction or substantial improvements of elevated structures that include fully
enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the flood protection
grade shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry
and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls.
(a) Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional
engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria:
(1) provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than
one square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area; and
(2) the bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above foundation
interior grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher than the exterior
foundation grade); and
(3) openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or
devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both
directions; and
(4) access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for
parking for vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and
(5) the interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished
into separate rooms; and
(6) portions of the building below the flood protection grade must be constructed
with materials resistant to flood damage.
E. Structures Constructed on Fill
A residential or nonresidential structure may be constructed on a permanent land fill in
accordance with the following:
(a) The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than 1 foot deep before compacting to 95%
of the maximum density obtainable with the Standard Proctor Test method.
(b) The fill should extend at least ten feet beyond the foundation of the structure before
sloping below the FPG.
(c) The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour during flooding by vegetative
cover, riprap, or bulkheading. If vegetative cover is used, the slopes shall be no steeper
than 3 horizontal to 1 vertical.
(d) The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface drainage from or onto neighboring
properties.
(e) The top of the lowest floor including basements shall be at or above the FPG.
F. Standards for Structures Constructed with a Crawlspace
A residential or nonresidential structure may be constructed with a crawlspace located below
the flood protection grade provided that the following conditions are met:
(a) The building must be designed and adequately anchored to resist flotation, collapse,
and lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic
loads, including the effects of buoyancy; and
AVON ZONING ORDINANCE
Town of Avon, Indiana 9. Town Ordinance 2002-14
(b) Any enclosed area below the flood protection grade shall have openings that equalize
hydrostatic pressures by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square
inch for every one square foot of enclosed area. The bottom of the openings shall be
no more than one foot above grade; and
(c) The interior height of the crawlspace measured from the interior grade of the
crawlspace to the top of the foundation wall must not exceed four feet at any point; and
(d) Utility systems within the crawlspace must be elevated above the flood protection
grade.
(e) An adequate drainage system must be installed to remove floodwaters from the interior
area of the crawlspace within a reasonable period of time after a flood event; and
(f) Portions of the building below the flood protection grade must be constructed with
materials resistant to flood damage.
(g) The interior grade of the crawlspace must be at or above the base flood elevation.
G. Standards for Manufactured Homes and Recreational Vehicles
Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles to be installed or substantially improved on a
site for more than 180 days must meet one of the following requirements:
(a) The manufactured home shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the
lowest floor shall be at or above the FPG and securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. This
requirement applies to all manufactured homes to be placed on a site;
(1) outside a manufactured home park or subdivision;
(2) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision;
(3) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or
(4) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a
manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as a result of a flood.
(b) The manufactured home shall be elevated so that the lowest floor of the manufactured
home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elevations that are no
less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. This
requirement applies to all manufactured homes to be placed on a site in an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision that has not been substantially damaged by a
flood.
(c) Recreational vehicles placed on a site shall either:
(1) be on site for less than 180 days; and,
(2) be fully licensed and ready for highway use (defined as being on its wheels
or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type
utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions); or
(3) meet the requirements for “manufactured homes” as stated earlier in this
section.
3. Standards for Subdivision Proposals
A. All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
B. All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
C. All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood
hazards, and;
AVON ZONING ORDINANCE
Town of Avon, Indiana 10. Town Ordinance 2002-14
D. Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed
development (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions), which is greater than
the lesser of fifty lots or five acres.
4. Critical Facility
Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of
the SFHA. Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if no
feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the
lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must
be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters.
Access routes elevated to or above the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent
possible.
5. Standards for Identified Floodways
Located within SFHAs, established in Section 17-4(2), are areas designated as floodways. The
floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris,
potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an identified floodway, the
Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all
pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for
a permit for construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of IC 14-28-1 a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to
the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or obstruction
activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading,
clearing and paving etc. undertaken before the actual start of construction of the structure.
However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to existing (lawful) residences
in a non-boundary river floodway. (IC 14-28-1-26 allows construction of non-substantial
additions/ improvements to residences in a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a
permit for construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please
note that if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior approval
(construction in a floodway permit) for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.)
No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a permit (when applicable) has
been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in
a floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway has been issued by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local Floodplain
Development Permit, provided the provisions contained in Section 17-6 of this chapter have been
met. The Floodplain Development Permit cannot be less restrictive than the permit for
construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a
community’s more restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
No development shall be allowed which acting alone or in combination with existing or future
development, will increase the regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot; and
For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including levees) the Town of Avon shall
submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the
regulatory flood data.
6. Standards for Identified Fringe
If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
Floodplain Development Permit provided the provisions contained in Section 17-6 of this chapter
have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of any new or substantially
improved structure shall be at or above the FPG.
7. Standards for SFHAs Without Established Base Flood Elevation and/or Floodways/Fringes
AVON ZONING ORDINANCE
Town of Avon, Indiana 11. Town Ordinance 2002-14
A. Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe have not
yet been determined, and the drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square
mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application,
along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources for review and comment.
No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until either a permit for
construction in a floodway or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the 100 year
flood elevation and the recommended Flood Protection Grade has been received from the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit for construction in a
floodway or floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development,
a Floodplain Development Permit may be issued provided the conditions of the Floodplain
Development Permit are not less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources and the provisions contained in Section 17-6 of this chapter
have been met.
B. Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe have not
yet been determined and the drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile,
the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis
showing the limits of the floodway, fringe and 100 year flood elevation for the site.
Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development
Permit, provided the provisions contained in Section 17-6 of this chapter have been met.
C. The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the regulatory flood more than 0.14 of
one foot and will not increase flood damages or potential flood damages.
Section 17-7. Variance Procedures
1. Designation of Variance and Appeals Board
The Board of Zoning Appeals as established by Town Council of the Town of Avon shall hear
and decide appeals and requests for variances from requirements of this chapter.
2. Duties of Variance and Appeals Board
The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any
requirement, decision, or determination is made by the Floodplain Administrator in the
enforcement or administration of this chapter.
A. Any determination of the Floodplain Administrator shall be rendered in writing, shall
constitute an Administrative Determination, and may be appealed within thirty (30) days of

water systems, and streets and bridges.
4. Conditions for Variances
A. Variances shall only be issued when there is:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship;
and,
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood
heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing laws or
ordinances.

Section 23-1. Purpose
The purpose of the US Highway 36 Overlay Zoning District is to promote and protect the public health,
safety, comfort, convenience, morals and general welfare by providing consistent and coordinated
standards for properties adjacent to or near the US Highway 36 Corridor in Avon, Indiana. The Avon
Plan Commission and Town Council, in establishing this zone, are relying on IC 36-7-4-600 et seq. and
IC 36-7-4-1400 et seq. The US Highway 36 Overlay Zoning District is intended to serve as a tool for
implementing the comprehensive plan. The corridor's character, viability, quality and functionality are
important to the Town of Avon because it is the community's primary east-west thoroughfare, and also a
major location for commercial uses that contribute to the local economy, and, as such, carries high
numbers of local travelers and visitors. Therefore, a further purpose of the US Highway 36 Overlay
Zoning District is to preserve and enhance the aesthetic qualities of properties both adjacent and visible
from the corridor through:
1. the promotion of coordinated development within the US Highway 36 Overlay Zoning District;
2. the establishment of high standards for development on properties within the overlay zone,
including buildings, signs, landscaping, parking and other site improvements, which permit
innovative site design while encouraging efficient land use;
3. the establishment of development and use standards that will promote the quality, scale, character
and type of development consistent with the corridor's high level of importance to the Town;
4. to diversify the workforce and provide more opportunities for residents of Avon to work in the
Town, specifically high tech, office, and higher education;
5. the establishment of access management standards to reduce the number of curb cuts along US
HWY 36 and improve traffic flow; and
6. to manage growth in undeveloped areas of town so not to increase traffic volume and degrade the
level of service of the corridor.
AVON ZONING ORDINANCE
Town of Avon, Indiana 3. Town Ordinance 2002-14
Section 23-2. Boundaries
The boundaries of the US Highway 36 Overlay Zoning District for the Town of Avon, Indiana, can be
generally described as follows:
Extending north ¼ mile from the northern edge of the US Highway 36 right-of-way and
extending south to the northern boundary of the railroad, for the entire length of the
highway within Avon's corporate limits, but excluding all property that is legally being
used as residential. If the residentially used property changes to a non-residential use, that
property shall become part of the overlay district and shall conform to the regulations of
the US Highway 36 Overlay Zoning District.
Furthermore, the overlay district is divided into three tiers. Each tier may have different zoning
regulations. Tier 1 includes the portion of any lot that is within 260 feet from the edge of US Highway 36
right-of-way or in front of the first east/west access road for the highway, regardless of whether there is
actual access from the highway. Tier 2 would include all other properties within the overlay district that
are not determined to be within Tier 1 or Tier 3. Tier 3 includes all property that is 660 feet or more from
the edge of the right-of-way of US Highway 36 and has tow or more lots between the edge of the right-ofway
and said 660 foot line.
It is the intent of this ordinance to extend this overlay district to include any new properties that are
annexed into Avon that would be within the north and south boundaries of the overlay. If only a portion
of a lot or tract falls within the overlay district, the entire property must be developed using the standards
of the overlay district. Likewise, if any portion of a lot or tract falls within more than one tier, the entire
property must be developed using the standards that apply to lowest number tier.
Section 23-3. Applicability to Existing Development
Existing development, which was developed legally, shall be considered non-conforming, with respect to
the overlay district standards. In the event of a casualty, natural disaster, or other force majuere event that
destroys a structure beyond 50% of its value, a legally existing non-conforming structure may be rebuilt
as it was. If it is to be larger than the non-conforming structure that was destroyed, than the new structure
must comply with these overlay district standards.
Any of the following proposed changes to an existing legally non-conforming structure or site shall
require that the addition or change comply with the overlay district standards:
1. If a proposed addition to a structure equals or exceeds 35% of the total existing building gross
floor area of that structure; or
2. If a proposed change to a parking area would result in an increase of 35% or more parking
spaces, or an increase in parking lot area of 35% or more.
The following improvements shall not be construed as improvements that will prompt the need to comply
with the standards of the overlay:
1. Changes to paint color. Additionally, changes in paint color do not require Plan Commission
approval provided the improvement complies with Section 23-18 (2(D)) of this ordinance; or
2. The addition of landscaping to a legal nonconforming site, that is not in association with
improvements listed in numbers 1 and 2 above. All new landscaping shall comply with the
Town of Avon’s approved species as found in Chapter 16 of the Avon Zoning Ordinance.
Note that the measurement is to be considered a cumulative measurement from the day that this ordinance
is enacted, so that once increases reach the 35% threshold, the overlay district standards shall apply.
Amendments to approved development plans shall be in compliance with Section 4-8 (9) of the zoning
ordinance.
AVON ZONING ORDINANCE
Town of Avon, Indiana 4. Town Ordinance 2002-14
Section 23-4. Green Design
All new development and major redevelopment within the US Highway 36 Overlay Zoning District is
encouraged, but not required to meet the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®)
Green Building Rating System certification requirements.
The Town of Avon believes green design not only makes a positive impact on public health and the
environment, but it also reduces operating costs, enhances building and organizational marketability,
potentially increases occupant productivity, and helps create a sustainable community.
Section 23-5. Uses
When determining whether a use is allowed in the US Highway 36 Overlay Zoning District, first consult
the underlying zoning district. If the use is allowed, then consult the following lists to determine if the
use is prohibited in the overlay, or if the use requires a special exception in the overlay zone. If a use is
legally established at the time the overlay ordinance is enacted, but is no longer permitted according to
this section, it shall be considered legally non-conforming, in compliance with Chapter 6 of the zoning
ordinance.
Tier 1, 2 & 3 Prohibited Uses and Special Exceptions SEE Chapter 27: Permitted Use Table
A special exception is required for retail development over 40,000 sq. ft. of gross floor area for multitenant
buildings and 25,000 sq. ft. for single tenant buildings west of SR 267 because of the traffic
impacts associated with regional retailers of a larger scale and further to promote responsible growth and
development in accordance with the Avon comprehensive plan. In considering special exceptions, the
Board of Zoning Appeals should consider whether the proposed land use would adversely impact traffic
management in the Town and if so what traffic mitigation measures are proposed for the site as well as
the land use vision of the Avon comprehensive plan.
Section 23-6. Accessory Buildings and Uses
All accessory uses and buildings that are permitted in the underlying primary zoning district(s) shall be
permitted, unless they are otherwise prohibited in this overlay zoning district. Any attached or detached
accessory building shall meet all the standards of this overlay district and shall be architecturally
compatible with the Principal Building(s) with which it is associated, unless the plan commission
approves alternative architecture. No accessory buildings are permitted unless there is a principal building
on the lot or tract.
Section 23-7. Properties with Agricultural Zoning
Properties within the overlay district which are zoned as Agricultural Overlay District and which are used
in accordance with the standards of that district shall be considered legally non-conforming upon the
adoption of this district. If the agricultural use changes, the property will no longer be considered as
legally non-conforming. The adoption of this overlay district should not be construed as a change in
zoning.
Section 23-8. Minimum Lot Size
The minimum lot size for new lots within the overlay zoning district shall be one (1) acre, except that for
those properties which have an underlying zoning designation of SC, the minimum lot size shall be six (6)
acres.
Section 23-9. Setbacks
1. Minimum Front -- The minimum front setback for all lots within Tier 1 is 60 feet. Lots within
Tiers 2 and 3 shall comply with the minimum front setback in the underlying primary zoning

Building height shall comply with the standard in the underlying zoning district.
Section 23-11. Utility Lines
All new on-site utility service lines shall be buried beneath the ground. If US Highway 36 is widened in
the future, the Town requests that all overhead utility lines along the highway be buried beneath the
ground.
Section 23-12. Parking & Loading
1. Pedestrian Walkways -- The plan commission shall approve all pedestrian walkways. Pedestrian
walkways should be coordinated with the interior parking lot landscaping. All surface-parking
areas with more than 200 parking spaces shall provide continuous internal pedestrian walkways
to connect the parking area with the primary building entrance(s). For all parking areas with
more than 50 spaces, there shall be at least one internal pedestrian walkway with a minimum
width of 5' that connects the internal pedestrian walkway with the public sidewalk or trail.
Pedestrian walkways shall be distinguished from driving surfaces through the use of durable, lowmaintenance
surface materials such as pavers, bricks, or scored/stamped concrete or asphalt.
Further, pedestrian walkways should be coordinated with landscape areas whenever possible or
their design of the walkways should provide some other form of protection from vehicles.
2. Parking in Front -- Within Tier 1, the maximum amount of parking that shall be allowed in front
of a building shall be 2 rows. Within Tier 2, only the minimum amount of required parking may
be located in front of the building. Any extra parking shall be located on the side or rear of the
building. Within Tier 3 there is no limit on how much of the approved parking may be placed in
front of the building. The plan commission may approve an alternative parking layout.
3. Extra Landscaping Required -- The extra parking area(s) in Tier 1 or Tier 2 that result from an
excess of parking over the maximum amount shall be provided with additional landscaping in
accordance with Section 23-15 (5), Interior Parking Lot Landscaping, below.

regulations and shall be located the closest to the entrance(s). Whenever possible there should be
separation between handicap and pick-up spaces.
5. Pick-up Spaces -- No more than 2 parking spaces may be designated for pick-up and shall be
shown on the plan. Pick-up spaces shall be located no closer to the entrance(s) than handicapped
spaces. Pick-up spaces shall include a sign, not to exceed 2 square feet which shall count as part
of a business's total sign area.
6. Bicycle Parking -- A bicycle parking area may be provided for each building, in an appropriate
and accessible location.
7. Loading -- Loading and unloading areas shall not be oriented to US Highway 36 or any other
public street and shall in all cases be placed behind the building.

All components of a drive-through, including stacking spaces, menu boards, and pick-up windows shall
be located within the side or rear yards of a lot. In no case shall any of these drive-through components
AVON ZONING ORDINANCE
Town of Avon, Indiana 6. Town Ordinance 2002-14
be located within the front yard, or in the case of a corner lot, shall not be located in the front yard that
faces US Highway 36.
Section 23-14. Access to Individual Tracts
The purpose of this Section is to discourage new curb cuts and to reduce the use of existing curb cuts
along U.S. Highway 36. Full access to all tracts from U.S. Highway 36 shall only occur at signalized
intersections, as depicted in Avon's Thoroughfare Plan. When development occurs where a future
business collector is indicated on the Thoroughfare Plan, the developer shall construct their portion of the
business collector (access road). In lieu of access to U.S. Highway 36, tracts shall be accessed via
connection to another arterial street, collector street, local street, or access easement through an adjoining

Section 24-1. Purpose, Intent and Authority
It is the purpose of the Ronald Reagan Corridor Overlay District (herein referred to as the “Overlay
District”) to promote and protect the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare by
providing for the consistent and coordinated treatment of the properties bordering the Ronald Reagan
Parkway in Hendricks County, Indiana. The Plan Commissions, Town Councils, and County
Commissioners, in establishing this district, are relying on IC-36-7-4-600 et. seq. and IC 36-7-4-1400 et.
seq. This overlay district is, intended to serve as a tool for implementing the development policies and
guidelines set forth in the Ronald Reagan Corridor Master Plan. The Ronald Reagan parkway is a limited
access highway and an important economic development corridor to Hendricks County. The Ronald
Reagan corridor is a premier location and employment center whose viability, quality, and character are
important to the community as a whole, adjacent residents, employees, business owners and taxing
districts. Therefore, it is the further purpose of the Ronald Reagan Corridor Overlay District:
1. To preserve the integrity of the road function through access management planning;
2. To maximize the opportunity to create high level development through sound land use planning;
and,
3. To create a premier economic address in Hendricks County through the development of aesthetic
standards that make the corridor appear as a planned twelve-mile campus.

Section 25-1. Purpose
The purpose of this chapter is to promote and protect the public health, safety, comfort, convenience,
morals and general welfare by providing standards for development along the Town’s arterial streets
addressing access management, safety through a multi-modal approach, and protection of the character of
existing developed areas. Signature Streets are identified as streets within the Town of Avon that are of
prime importance to the Town because they are an arterial, a major gateway in and out of the Town,
and/or are of local importance to the community.
Signature Streets are classified as such, further, because the development along these corridors should be
consistent with the importance of the corridor to the Town. Signature Streets demonstrate the character of
the community and tie into the regional transportation network.
Section 25-2. Designation
Signature Streets are identified as Dan Jones Road, SR 267, US HWY 36, Ronald Reagan Parkway, CR
100 N, CR 200 N, CR 200 S and CR 100 S. US HWY 36 and the Ronald Reagan Parkway are addressed
through overlay districts.

Basic Provisions
Article
Article 1: Ordinance Foundation 1-3
01
C. Wastewater and Water Utilities: Under no circumstances shall any reference to "utility" or "utilities" within the
Avon Subdivision Control Ordinance apply to or supersede design and construction standards from (or installation
of) a non-town of Avon water or wastewater utility. Specifically, this exemption separates design and construction,
waiver, dedication of improvement, performance and maintenance surety, and easement standards from
being applicable to a non-town of Avon water or wastewater utility. However, this exemption does not include
Town of Avon design and construction standards for the location, spacing and type of fire hydrants or requirements
for looping of water lines used to supply hydrants. The exemption also does not pertain to the procedural
requirement for coordinating all utilities and surface infrastructure within a subdivision or give rights to exclude
the Town of Avon access to draft utility plans, documents or plans submitted for review to utility providers, identified
or proposed design alternatives, correspondences between parties, or notes on design decisions; nor does it
preclude a representative from the Town of Avon from being notified of and in attendance at meetings between the
developer (and his/her representatives) and the utility provider (and its representatives).
1.06 Severability
If any provision or the application of any provision of this Subdivision Control Ordinance is held unconstitutional
or invalid by the courts, the remainder of this Subdivision Control Ordinance or the application of such provision to
other circumstances shall not be affected.
1.07 Interpretation
The provisions of this Subdivision Control Ordinance are the minimum requirements necessary for the protection of
the health, safety, comfort, morals, convenience, and general welfare of the people at large. The provisions are also
designed to establish and maintain reasonable community standards for the physical environment. If two (2) or more
provisions within this Subdivision Control Ordinance are in conflict or are inconsistent with one another, then the
provision which is most restrictive shall control.
1.08 Ordinance Jurisdictional Area
This Subdivision Control Ordinance applies to all land within the town limits of Avon, Indiana.
1.09 Conflicting Regulatory Documents
When this Subdivision Control Ordinance conflicts with private covenants, private contracts, commitments, permits,
agreements, state laws, federal laws or other regulations that apply to a right of way, lot establishment, common
area, utilities, drainage, easements, structures and the like, the most restrictive provision shall control. However, this
provision shall not be construed to apply to a non-town of Avon wastewater or stormwater utility.
1.10 Actions Pending
This Subdivision Control Ordinance shall not be construed as eliminating or reducing any action now pending under,
or by virtue of, an existing law or previous Subdivision Control Ordinance. Also, this Subdivision Control Ordinance
shall not be construed as discontinuing, reducing, modifying, or altering any penalty accruing or about to accrue.
1.11 Repealer
The Town of Avon Subdivision Control Ordinance of July 18, 1996, Resolution #1996-3 as amended is hereby
repealed and replaced by this Subdivision Control Ordinance.
1.12 Transition Rules
A. Applications: Any application (e.g. Primary Plat, Final Plat, or Plat Amendment) filed with the Plan Commission
that is full and complete prior to the effective date of this Subdivision Control Ordinance shall be regulated by the
terms and conditions of the Subdivision Control Ordinance that was in place at the time of filing.
B. Final Plat: Any final which was approved prior to the effective date of this Subdivision Control Ordinance
may complete all aspects of that subdivision as was approved. However, any public improvements that are not
completed after seven (7) years shall be required to meet the standards for such under this Subdivision Control
Ordinance.
C. Primary Plat: Any primary plat which was approved prior to the effective date of this Subdivision Control
Ordinance may pursue final approval under the subdivision regulations in effect at the time of the primary plat
approval, or under this Subdivision Control Ordinance, so long as it is fully utilizing one ordinance or the other
(i.e. "whole cloth" application). However, any primary plat, or phase thereof, that does not seek final approval
after seven (7) years from the application date shall be regulated under this Subdivision Control Ordinance.
Basic Provisions

Article
1-4
01
1.13 Administrative Officer
The Zoning Administrator shall have the primary responsibility for administration and enforcement (or coordination
of enforcement) of this Subdivision Control Ordinance within the Town of Avon’s planning jurisdiction.
1.14 Exemptions
The following actions are exempt from the regulations of the Subdivision Control Ordinance. All exempt subdivisions
shall still be recorded at the office of the Hendricks County Recorder.

building sites are created by the modification.

lines.
1.15 Waivers
A. Justification: When the Plan Commission finds that a better design is achieved, and the intent of these regulations
may be served to a greater extent by an alternative proposal, it may approve a waiver from standards set forth in
the Subdivision Control Ordinance so that the public interest is served, and provided that such waiver does not
lessen the intent and purpose of the Subdivision Control Ordinance.
B. Authority: The Plan Commission has sole authority to grant waivers to the Subdivision Control Ordinance.
C. Findings: The Plan Commission shall not approve waivers unless it makes written findings based upon the
evidence presented to it in each specific case such that:
1. Public Safety: The granting of the waiver will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or general
welfare, or be injurious to adjacent or nearby property;
2. Subdivision Control Ordinance: The granting of the waiver will not contradict the intent of design standards
within or the purpose of the Town of Avon Subdivision Control Ordinance;
3. Unique Conditions: The conditions upon which the request for waiver is based are unique to the property for
which a waiver is sought and are not applicable generally to other properties;
4. Physical Characteristics: Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions
of the specific property involved, a hardship to the owner would result if the strict letter of these regulations
were carried out. A hardship is distinguished from a mere inconvenience; and
5. Comprehensive Plan and Zoning Ordinance: The granting of the waiver will not contradict the intent of
the regulations in the Town of Avon Zoning Ordinance or the goals and objectives in the Town of Avon
Comprehensive Plan.
D. Procedure: The procedure for requesting a waiver is as follows:
1. Statement of Request: At the time of filing a subdivision plat, the petitioner shall submit a detailed written
statement of any waivers of the Subdivision Control Ordinance being requested which shall fully state the
grounds for the request and file detailed written findings of fact in support of such waiver request.
2. Limitations: Only design standards specifically identified in the request may be waived by the Plan
Commission.
3. Public Hearing: Waivers may only be granted during a process which requires a public hearing.

Design Standards Introduction
3.01 Using This Section
The following pages contain the design standards for site and infrastructure improvements associated with subdivisions.
Each section represents the regulations for a specific category and they apply cumulatively. There are two (2)
ways to determine which design standards apply to a specific type of petition. They are:
A. Using Two-page Layouts: Refer to the two-page layouts in Article 2: Subdivision Types for a specific subdivision
type. Applicable design standards for that specific subdivision type are identified by four-digit codes in the
"Additional Design Standards that Apply" section. Only the four-digit codes noted in the "Additional Design
Standards that Apply" section apply to that subdivision type.
B. Using Icons: Refer to the subdivision type icons used at the top of each design standards section in Article 3:
Design Standards. Each design standard section begins with a four-digit code and introductory sentence followed
by icons that represent each subdivision type. These icons note that the design standards written in that section
applies to that type of subdivision.

F. Installation and Maintenance:
1. Minimum Standards: The standards within Section 3.03 shall be considered minimum standards for
installation.
2. Maintenance Prior to Resident Control: Any amenity center provided as a part of a plat approval shall be
maintained in accordance with the standards of Section 3.03: Amenity Center Standards while the developer
(or their successor or assign) maintains control of the owners' association. Removal or modification of any
amenity center shall require Plan Commission approval.
3. Maintenance After Transition of Control: Once the control of the subdivision owners' association has legally
been transferred to the residents, maintenance of the amenity centers shall be the responsibility of the owners'
association. Removal or modification of any amenity center shall require Plan Commission approval. Any
subdivision that received a density or intensity bonus from installation of amenity centers shall be required to
employ professional Owner's Association management services. However, by 2/3 vote, the property owners
with the subdivision may opt out of professional management services, thus assuming full responsibility for
managing the amenities.
4. ADA Accessibility: An amenity center shall comply with ADA accessibility standards. If, by characteristics
inherent to the proposed amenity's physical nature, cannot be made to be ADA accessibility compliant, it
may be approved by the Plan Commission provided it does not serve as the only proposed amenity center
for the development. All amenity centers, once constructed in compliance with ADA accessibility standards,
shall be maintained as such in perpetuity, regardless of whether controlled by the developer or home owners'
association.
G. Determination of Parent Tract: If two (2) or more lots are:
1. Timing: Going to be developed concurrently or sequentially over time; and are
2. Contiguity: Contiguous to one another; including when separated by a right-of-way or easement, or when
within 100 feet of the boundary of one another; and are
3. Same Ownership: Either being:
a. Platted by one (1) or more persons or entities with fifty percent (50%) or more stake in developing the
lots. Two or more separate corporate entities with one (1) or more persons having majority ownership in
those corporate entities shall constitute same ownership; or
b. Built-out by predominantly or fully by a single builder; then
4. Regulated as One: The two (2) or more lots shall be regulated as a single development and be subject to the
amenity center standards above. For example, if a 200 lot subdivision is separated by a collector from a 300
lot subdivision are platted by predominantly the same entity, then the amenity standards shall apply to the
two (2) developments as if they were a single development. Between the two (2) developments, the amenity
standards for a 500 lot subdivision would be required.

easement, street right-of-way, or the like. Perimeter landscaping is also not required when the perimeter is
tangent to a riparian corridor or a park.
4. Plantings: Trees and bushes shall be provided at a rate of:
a. Canopy Trees: A minimum of two (2) canopy trees shall be planted per 100 lineal feet of subdivision
perimeter when the perimeter landscaping area is designated to be ten (10) feet or less in width. One (1)
additional canopy tree per 100 lineal feet shall be required for each additional five (5) feet of required
perimeter landscaping width. Under no circumstances shall the total number of required canopy trees per
100 lineal feet exceed five (5) trees.
• Example 1: When the required perimeter landscaping area is twenty (20) feet in width, a minimum of
four (4) canopy trees would be required per 100 lineal feet.
• Example 2: When the required perimeter landscaping area is forty (40) feet in width, the total number
of required canopy trees per 100 lineal feet would be capped at five (5).
b. Ornamental, Understory, or Evergreen Trees: A minimum of three (3) ornamental, understory, or evergreen
trees (or combination thereof) shall be planted per 100 lineal feet of subdivision perimeter when
the perimeter landscaping area is designated to be ten (10) feet or less in width. One (1) additional
ornamental, understory, or evergreen tree per 100 lineal feet shall be required for each additional five (5)
feet of required perimeter landscaping width. Under no circumstances shall the total number of required
ornamental, understory, or evergreen trees per 100 lineal feet exceed six (6) trees.
• Example 1: When the required perimeter landscaping area is twenty (20) feet in width, a minimum of
five (5) ornamental, understory, or evergreen trees (or combination thereof) would be required per 100
lineal feet.
• Example 2: When the required perimeter landscaping area is forty (40) feet in width, the total number

required perimeter landscaping width. Under no circumstances shall the total number of required woody
shrubs per 100 lineal feet exceed fourteen (14) woody shrubs.
• Example 1: When the required perimeter landscaping area is twenty (20) feet in width, a minimum of
eleven (11) woody shrubs would be required per 100 lineal feet.
• Example 2: When the required perimeter landscaping area is forty (40) feet in width, the total number
of required woody shrubs per 100 lineal feet would be capped at fourteen (14).
d. Maximum Number of Evergreen Trees: Under no circumstances shall evergreen trees exceed forty
percent (40%) of all plant material installed by elective or to meet the minimum standards.

A. Purpose and Intent: An administrative subdivision shall provide the Town of Avon with the opportunity to
expedite adjustments to property lines when no new lots are created, or when mergers parcels are made into fewer
buildable lots (e.g. merging two lots into one developable lot for the purpose of constructing across the middle of
the two lots). This provision is an administrative process for exempt forms of subdivision.
B. Project Applicability: An administrative subdivision can be used to modify the division of property within the
jurisdictional area of the Plan Commission, but only if the proposed modification meets the "Applicable Districts,"
"Applicable Actions," and "Prerequisites" standards written below. All other divisions of land or alterations to
property lines must be processed as a Minor Subdivision or Major Subdivision.

in an existing nonconformance; and when there is no change to public services, roads, or utilities.
b. Splitting a Lot and Merging its Pieces with Two or More Adjacent Lots: Two (2) or more owners
adjacent to a vacant lot may jointly purchase the lot, divide it, and merge all of the pieces with their buildable
lot. If the lot is not vacant, the primary structure shall have to be demolished and/or the primary use
dissolved, prior to application for an administrative subdivision.
c. Adjusting Lot Lines: Two owners may adjust a lot line separating their two properties if survey errors
were discovered or if both owners desire such a modification; as long as it does not result in a new
nonconformance or an escalation in an existing nonconformance; and does not reduce either's lot area by
more than twenty-five percent (25%).
C. Prerequisites:
1. Eligible Applicant: An application for an administrative subdivision shall be initiated by the owner(s) of
all applicable lots or the owner's authorized agent. If an authorized agent files an application, a signed and
notarized consent form from the owner(s) shall accompany the application.

ii. The conditions upon which the request for a Subdivision Waiver is based are unique to the
property for which the Subdivision Waiver is sought and are not applicable generally to other
property; and

Definitions - Zone B 05
Yard, Front: The horizontal space between the nearest foundation or structural appurtenance, or roof eave
(whichever is closer) to the Front Lot Line, extending to the side lines of the lot, and measured as the shortest
distance from that foundation to the Front Lot Line. (See Graphic for "Yard").
Yard, Rear: The horizontal space between the nearest foundation or structural appurtenance of a building to a
rear lot line and that rear lot line, extending to the side lines of the lot, and measured as the shortest distance from
the foundation to the rear lot line. Corner lots do not have rear yards, rather they have two (2) side yards. (See
Graphic for "Yard").
Yard, Side: The horizontal space between the nearest foundation or structural appurtenance of a building to the
side lot line. (See Graphic for "Yard").
Zone A: Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snow melt,
or a combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a
significant threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30, Zone AO, Zone AH,
Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM or FHBM. The definitions are presented below:
1. Zone A: Areas subject to inundation by the one percent (1%) annual chance flood event. Because detailed
hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base flood elevation or depths are shown. Mandatory flood
insurance purchase requirements apply.
2. Zone AE and A1-A30: Areas subject to inundation by the one percent (1%) annual chance flood event
determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are shown within these zones. Mandatory flood
insurance purchase requirements apply. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones A1-A30.)
3. Zone AO: Areas subject to inundation by one percent (1%) annual chance shallow flooding (usually sheet
flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are between one (1) and three (3) feet. Average flood depths
derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase
requirements apply.
4. Zone AH: Areas subject to inundation by one percent (1%) annual chance shallow flooding (usually areas
of ponding) where average depths are from one (1) to three (3) feet. Average flood depths derived from
detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements
apply.
5. Zone AR: Areas that result from the decertification of a previously accredited flood protection system that
is determined to be in the process of being restored to provide base flood protection. Mandatory flood
insurance purchase requirements apply.
6. Zone A99: Areas subject to inundation by the one percent (1%) annual chance flood event, but which
will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-construction federal flood protection system.
These are areas of special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a
protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance rating purposes.
Zone A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has reached specified statutory progress
toward completion. No base flood elevations or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase
requirements apply.
Zone A1-A30: See "Zone A."
Zone A99: See "Zone A."
Zone AE: See "Zone A."
Zone AH: See "Zone A."
Zone AO: See "Zone A."
Zone AR: See "Zone A."
Zone B: Areas identified as areas of moderate or minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area.
However, structures in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall coupled with inadequate
local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is not required by
regulation in these zones. (Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and C.)

Definitions - Zone C
Zone C: Areas identified as areas of moderate or minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area.
However, structures in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall coupled with inadequate
local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is not required by
regulation in these zones. (Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and C.)
Zone, Floodplain: A geographical area shown on a FHBM or FIRM that reflects the severity or type of flooding
in the area.
Zone X: The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA. Shaded X Zones shown on recent
FIRMs (B Zones on older FIRMs) designate areas subject to inundation by the flood with a two-tenths of one
percent (0.2%) chance of being equaled or exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X Zones (C Zones on
older FIRMs) designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less than two-tenths of one
percent (0.2%).
Zoning Administrator: The officer appointed by and/or delegated the responsibility for the administration of
the Subdivision Control Ordinance. The term “Zoning Administrator” includes his/her delegates or other Plan
Commission authorized representatives.
