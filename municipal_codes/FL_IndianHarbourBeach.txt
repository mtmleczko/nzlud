PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Indian Harbour Beach, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1981 Code, as supplemented through July 2013, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1981 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Dennis Sinnett, Vice President, and Kelly B. Cribbs, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Deborah Maliska, City Clerk, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 2.1-1.2. - Authority. 
    The sexually oriented business and adult entertainment ordinance is enacted pursuant to the constitutionally derived home rule power of the City of Indian Harbour Beach established pursuant to Article VIII, Section 2(b), Florida Constitution and Chapter 166, Florida Statutes, and in the interest of the health, peace, safety, morals and general welfare of the people of Indian Harbour Beach, and under the authority of the city to regulate the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages under the city's police powers and the Twenty-First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

Sec. 2.1-3. - Purpose.

Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene or otherwise illegal material. 
(Ord. No. 99-1, § 2, 2-9-99) 
Sec. 2.1-4. - Findings of facts. 
    Based upon evidence and testimony presented at public hearings before the City Council of the City of Indian Harbour Beach, which included a presentation indicating the adverse secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments and sexually oriented businesses in other communities in the United States and in reports made available to the city council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v. American Mini Theaters, 426 U.S. 50 (1976); Barnes v. Glen Theater, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), and on the substance of and findings made or incorporated in studies accomplished in other communities and ordinances enacted in other communities, including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Tuscon, Arizona; St. Paul, Minnesota; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; New York, New York; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Austin, Texas; Macon-Bibb County, Georgia; Palm Beach County, Florida; Manatee County, Florida; the findings of the Attorney General of the State of Minnesota; the report of the United States Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986); Jacksonville, Florida; Detroit, Michigan; and "A Summary of a National Survey of Real Estate Appraisers Regarding the Effect of Adult Bookstores on Property Values," conducted by the Division of Planning, Department of Metropolitan Development, Indianapolis, January 1984; the publication entitled "Protecting Communities From Sexually Oriented Businesses" (Southwest Legal Press, Inc.); the publication entitled "Local Regulation of Adult Businesses" (Clark, Boardman and Callaghan); publications prepared by the Florida Family Association, Inc. (Tampa, Florida) relating to the regulation of sexually oriented businesses and adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses; the "Report to: The American Center for Law and Justice on the Secondary Impacts of Sex Oriented Businesses", Peter R. Hecht, Ph.D. (1996); and the findings of fact relating to the Adult Entertainment Code of Orange County, Florida, and Seminole County, Florida, two (2) neighboring counties in Central Florida, other matters and materials submitted at the public hearings relating to this chapter and other matters and documents relating to all of the above; the council finds: 
(a)  Establishments exist or may exist within the City of Indian Harbour Beach and other nearby cities and counties in Central Florida where books, magazines, periodicals, pamphlets, newspapers, comic books, story papers, written or printed stories or articles, writing paper, cards, novelties, pictures, drawings, photographs, motion picture films, figures, images, phonograph records, wires, tapes or other recordings, or any written, printed or recorded matter of any such character which may or may not require mechanical or other means to be transmitted into auditory, visual or sensory representations of such character, and/or any devices which depict, illustrate, describe or relate to specified sexual activities are possessed, displayed, exhibited, distributed and/or sold. 
(b)  Establishments exist or may exist within the City of Indian Harbour Beach and other nearby cities and counties in Central Florida: 
(1)  Where the superficial tissues of one (1) person are manipulated, rubbed, stroked, kneaded, and/or tapped by a second person, accompanied by the display or exposure of specified anatomical areas; 
(2)  Where dancers, entertainers, performers or other individuals who, for any form of commercial gain, perform or are presented while displaying or exposing any specified anatomical area; or 
(3)  Where straddle dancing occurs. 
(c)  The activities described in subsections (a) and (b) occur at commercial establishments and as such, are subject to regulation by the City of Indian Harbour Beach in the interest of the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the people, businesses, and industries of the City of Indian Harbour Beach. 
(d)  When the activities described in subsections (a) and (b) are present in establishments within the City of Indian Harbour Beach and other communities, other activities which are illegal, immoral or unhealthful tend to accompany them, concentrate around them and be aggravated by them. Such other activities include, but are not limited to, prostitution, pandering, solicitation for prostitution, lewd and lascivious behavior, exposing minors to harmful materials, possession, distribution and transportation of obscene materials, sale or possession of controlled substances, and violent crimes against persons and property. 
(e)  When the activities described in subsections (a) and (b) are present in establishments within the City of Indian Harbour Beach and other communities, they tend to attract an undesirable number of transients, blight neighborhoods, adversely affect neighboring businesses, lower real property values, promote crime, particularly the kinds detailed in subsection (d), and ultimately lead residents and businesses to move to other locations. 
(f)  The establishments in which the activities described in subsections (a) and (b) occur are usually constructed, in part or in whole, of substandard materials, and are usually maintained in a manner reflecting disregard for the health and safety of the occupants. 
(g)  The activities described in subsections (a) and (b) frequently occur in establishments concurrent with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages. 
(h)  The concurrence of the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages with the activities described in subsections (a) and (b) leads to an increase in criminal activity, moral degradation and disturbances of the peace and order of the City of Indian Harbour Beach and other communities. 
(i)  The concurrence of the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages with the activities described in subsections (a) and (b) is hazardous to the health and safety of those persons in attendance, depreciates the value of adjoining real property, harms the economic welfare of the City of Indian Harbour Beach, and adversely affects the public's interest in the quality of life, tone of commerce, and community environment in the City of Indian Harbour Beach and other communities. 
(j)  In order to preserve and safeguard the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the people, businesses, and industries of the City of Indian Harbour Beach, it is necessary and advisable for the City of Indian Harbour Beach to regulate the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages at establishments where the activities described in subsections (a) and (b) occur. 
(k)  Workers of establishments at which the activities described in subsections (a) and (b) occur, engage in a higher incidence of certain types of criminal behavior than workers of other establishments. 
(l)  Physical contact within establishments at which the activities described in subsections (a) and (b) occur between workers exhibiting specified anatomical areas and customers poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and social diseases. 
(m)  In order to preserve and safeguard the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the people, businesses, and industries of the City of Indian Harbour Beach, it is necessary and advisable for the City of Indian Harbour Beach to regulate the conduct of owners, managers, operators, workers, agents, employees, entertainers, performers and customers at establishments where the activities described in subsections (a) and (b) occur. 
(n)  The potential dangers to the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the people, businesses, and industries of the City of Indian Harbour Beach posed by permitting an establishment at which the activities described in subsections (a) and (b) occur to operate without first obtaining a license under this chapter are so great as to require the licensure of such establishments prior to their being permitted to operate. 
(o)  Requiring licensees of establishments at which the activities described in subsections (a) and (b) occur to maintain information concerning current workers and certain past workers will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects, protects minors, assure correct identification of workers, deploy law enforcement personnel effectively, and notify workers of conduct that is permitted and prohibited under this chapter. 
(p)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments. Further, such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the establishment is operated in a manner consistent with the good order, health, safety and welfare of its patrons and workers, as well as the citizens of Indian Harbour Beach. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the establishment, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
(q)  Prohibiting establishments at which the activities described in subsections (a) and (b) occur from operating within set distances of educational institutions, religious institutions, areas zoned for residential use and parks at which minors are customarily found will serve to protect minors from the adverse affects of the activities that accompany such establishments. 
(r)  "Straddle dancing" is primarily conduct rather than communication or expression. Straddle dancing, unregulated private performances, and enclosed adult booths in sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments have resulted in indiscriminate commercial sex between strangers and poses a threat to the health of the participants and promotes the spread of communicable sexually transmitted diseases. 
(s)  The activities described above often occur between the establishment workers exhibiting specified anatomical areas and the establishment's customers. As a result, often these workers pose a threat to the health of both themselves and customers and promote the spread of communicable and social diseases. 
(t)  When the activities described above are present in establishments, they tend to adversely affect property values, encourage illegal, immoral, or unhealthy behavior, and threatens the present and future character of neighborhoods. 
(u)  Workers at adult entertainment establishments and sexually oriented businesses engage in a higher incident of certain types of unhealthy or criminal behavior than workers in other establishments including a very high incidence of illegal prostitution or engaging in lewdness in violation of Chapter 796 of the Florida Statutes, operation without occupational licenses, and illegal unlicensed massage. 
(v)  The practice of not paying, or paying low wages to, workers at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments and requiring them to earn their entire, or most of their, income from tips or gratuities from their customers who are predisposed to want sexual activity has resulted in an extremely high, nearly universal, incidence of prostitution and crimes related to lewdness by workers. 
(w)  Sexually oriented businesses involve activities that are pure conduct engaged in for the purpose of making a profit, rather than speech or expressive activity and therefore are subject to and require increased regulation to protect the health, welfare and safety of the community. 
(x)  Requiring sexually oriented businesses to post a listing of services provided and restrict services to those listed as well as maintaining a transaction record in a daily register will discourage incidents of criminal behavior such as lewdness and prostitution thereby further safeguarding the health of both workers and customers and will assist facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects if criminal acts do occur. 
(y)  Sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments lead themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled or not adequately controlled by the operators of the establishments or businesses. Further, there are presently no mechanisms or inadequate mechanisms to make the owners of these businesses or establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. 
(z)  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments, especially those which provide private or semi-private areas, booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, live sex shows and those having physical interaction between workers and customers. 
(aa)  Offering and providing such private spaces encourages such previously mentioned activities, which create unhealthy conditions. 
(bb)  The surgeon general of the United States in his report of October 22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn. 
(cc)  According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. 
(dd)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of owners and operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. 
(ee)  Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments where persons view "adult" oriented films. 
(ff)  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters. 
(gg)  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. 
(hh)  It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases, to protect minors, to assure correct identification of persons working in establishments, to enable the effective deployment of law enforcement personnel, to notify workers of conduct that is permitted and prohibited under this chapter, and to detect and discourage the involvement of organized crime in the adult entertainment and sexually oriented business industry, to have available for inspection from operators of establishments a limited amount of information regarding certain workers who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity. 
    The findings made herein raise important, substantial, and compelling governmental concerns. Sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those governmental concerns.

On December 31st the hours shall be extended until 4:00 a.m. 
    For the remainder of the city's fiscal year 2016/2017, vendors shall not be required to obtain an extended hours of operation permit. Commencing with October 1, 2017 and the following fiscal years, vendors shall be required to obtain and possess an extended hours of operation permit.

As a condition of the continuation of the privilege, vendors are required to take all necessary steps to minimize the negative impacts that their establishment may cause in nearby residential or commercial neighborhoods. The city council shall consider the following in deciding whether to suspend, revoke or condition the privilege: 
(1)  Whether there is adequate off-street parking in relation to the demands created during the extra hours of operation, with special regard to any adverse impact on adjacent residential areas of any illegal or hazardous parking that can be traced directly to a particular vendor. For the purposes of this section, sufficient evidence of an adverse impact on adjacent residential areas will exist upon verification by police or code enforcement officials that more than ten (10) patrons of the vendor have parked illegally on public rights of way or property, or on private property upon receipt of a complaint by the property owner which has been communicated to the vendor. This provision will only apply if the parking provided by the vendor is at maximum capacity at the time the illegal parking takes place, or is otherwise determined to be inadequate given the size of the crowds that the vendor draws; illegal parking by an individual patron shall not constitute a violation of this subsection; 
(2)  Law enforcement activities on the vendor's property during the extra hours of operation, both outside and inside the permitted location, with particular emphasis on illegal activity of the owner, employees, or others associated with the establishment, including use, sale or delivery of controlled substances, allowing underage drinking, violation of open container laws and loitering by intoxicated individuals. The city council shall also consider whether the need for law enforcement involvement was the result of the establishment's failure or inability to maintain proper order and control during the extended business hours; 
(3)  Complaints verified by the police, arising from adverse effects extra hours of operation have upon neighboring properties, including the effects of noise, parking, vandalism, generation of trash or garbage, loitering by intoxicated persons or exterior lighting on neighboring residential properties. It shall be a defense to the applicability of this section that the vendor has adequate security personnel and has implemented a policy requiring that security personnel patrol the premises as well as all known parking lots that patrons use, to assure the orderly conduct of patrons as they arrive at the establishment or as they depart. Complaints involving neighboring properties must be traceable to the actions of the owner and/or his employees. Noise complaints shall be traceable to the actions of the vendor or his employees by entertainment provided by the vendor or noise generated from the seating areas or entertainment areas of the vendor and not individual discussions, conversations by patrons within parking areas. Upon a showing of such security precautions, the vendor shall only be held accountable if the conduct complained of constitutes a violation by the vendor of any provision of the City of Indian Harbour Beach Code of Ordinances; 
(4)  Violations of any provisions of the City of Indian Harbour Beach Code of Ordinances; specially, including but not limited to, section 11-10 relating to noise and sound limitations; 
(5)  Failure to obtain an extended hours of operation permit, or failure to renew the permit as required by subsections (b) and (e) above; 
(6)  Violations of laws relating to the maximum permissible occupancy of vendor; 
(7)  Violation of any provisions of the City of Indian Harbour Beach Code of Ordinances, state or federal law. 
(i)  Permit suspension process. 
(1)  In order to invoke the enforcement provisions of this section, the activities described hereinabove must be traceable to the particular vendor against whom action is being taken, and also must be verified by a police report, police officers or code enforcement officer on the scene. Although not required, police officers and code enforcement officers may, at their discretion, issue warnings that shall not be considered a notice of violation, to put the vendor on notice that a particular problem or problems must be addressed and could result in a notice of violation if not corrected. 
(2)  In addition, the first violation by a vendor of a city code violation (not state law violation), shall be a written warning and not a notice of violation. Any subsequent violation of any section of the city code may result in a notice of violation. 
(3)  A vendor is encouraged to initiate calls for service to the police department if law violations are occurring on vendor's property. A notice of violation shall not be initiated for vendor initiated calls. 
(4)  It is recognized that an incident that may occur during an extended hour period, i.e. between 11:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m. could involve more than one (1) section of the code or violation of law. Any notice of violation that is issued that may involve multiple code or law violations on one (1) incident shall constitute one (1) notice of violation. 
(5)  Notice of violation may be issued by a police officer or the official of a violation of this section and shall be issued to any vendor that meets, or where applicable, fails to meet the criteria established above. The notice of violation shall be left with the owner, proprietor, or highest ranking employee then on the premises. An additional copy of the notice will also be mailed via U.S. mail, certified, return receipt requested, to the vendor at the street address provided in the application.

(7)  Written notice of the charges against the vendor shall be provided at least fourteen (14) days in advance of the hearing. The notice shall also contain the date, time and place of the hearing. Such notice shall also advise the vendor of the right to be heard, of the right to be represented by counsel, of the right to present sworn testimony on the vendor's behalf, and the right to appeal to circuit court.

(10)  The city council may delegate the responsibility for conducting hearings pursuant to this section to a special magistrate. Any such delegation shall be by resolution.

Sec. 4-1. - Findings; adoption of Brevard County Animal Control Act; alternative provision for enforcement by county authorities and by city authorities-Exceptions. 
    The city council of the City of Indian Harbour Beach has determined that feral animals within the city limits can create a nuisance disturbance, prey on common and rare species of native wildlife in Florida, including species listed as threatened or endangered by the state and federal governments, carry and spread diseases, destroy property, compete with native wildlife for food and shelter, as well as copious fecal deposits made by said feral animals; and, permitting the establishment of feral animal colonies on city owned property may result in liability on the part of the city at the expense of the taxpayers of the city; and, that prohibiting the feeding, breeding, maintaining, harboring and keeping of feral animals promotes the general welfare of the citizenry by preventing the proliferation of feral animals; and, the city council finds that this ordinance promotes the general health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city. In support hereof the city council has considered the following information: 
    The Florida Wildlife Commission information; Cats: Free Ranging and Feral; myfwc.com/wildlifehabitats/nonnatives/mammals/feral-cats/;

Provided; however, to the extent that there is a conflict between the provisions of this chapter and Chapter 14 of the Brevard County Code of Ordinances, this chapter shall control. Further provided that Section 14-64 of the Brevard County Code of Ordinances is not adopted by the city. 
(b)  Enforcement by county authorities. The city hereby agrees that the provisions of said Chapter 14 of the Code of Ordinances of Brevard County, Florida, may be enforced within the city by the duly appointed officers of Brevard County, as set forth in Section 14-41 of the Brevard County Code. 
(c)  Alternative enforcement by city officials. As an alternative to the enforcement of the Brevard County Animal Control Act by county officials as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the city shall also have the power and authority for such enforcement by officials employed by the city. For purposes of enforcement of the Brevard County Animal Control Act by city officials rather than county officials, Chapter 14 of the Brevard County Code shall be interpreted as follows: 
(1)  The city manager shall be designated as the animal control director for all purposes set forth in the Brevard County Animal Control Act and shall have all of the powers and duties set forth therein with respect to enforcement of said act. 
(2)  The code enforcement officer and all sworn police officers of the city shall be designated as animal control officers for all purposes set forth in the Brevard County Animal Control Act.

Example 1: When a space has two (2) ten-ton systems with each having an independent duct system, the contractor may design these two systems since each system is less than fifteen (15) tons. 
Example 2: Consider a small single-story office building which consists of six (6) individual offices where each office has a single three-ton package air conditioning heat pump. The six (6) heat pumps are connected to a single water cooling tower. The cost of the entire heating, ventilation and air conditioning work is forty-seven thousand dollars ($47,000.00) and the office building accommodates fewer than one hundred (100) persons. 
Note: It was further clarified by the commission that the limiting criteria of one hundred (100) persons and fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) apply to the building occupancy load and the cost of the total air-conditioning system of the building. 
5.  Any specialized mechanical, electrical, or plumbing document for any new building or addition which includes a medical gas, oxygen, steam, vacuum, toxic air filtration, halon, or fire detection and alarm system which costs more than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). 
Documents requiring an engineer seal by this part shall not be valid unless a professional engineer who possesses a valid certificate of registration has signed, dated, and stamped such document as provided in s. 471.025, Florida Statutes. 
104.4.1.4 An enforcing authority may not issue a building permit for any building construction, erection, alteration, modification, repair or addition unless the permit either includes on its face or there is attached to the permit the following statement: "NOTICE: In addition to the requirements of this permit, there may be additional restrictions applicable to this property that may be found in the public records of this county, and there may be additional permits required from other governmental entities such as water management districts, state agencies or federal agencies." 
104.4.1.5 A building permit for a single-family residential dwelling must be issued within thirty (30) working days of application therefore unless unusual circumstances require a longer time for processing the application or unless the permit application fails to satisfy the Florida Building Code; or the enforcing agency's laws or ordinances. 
104.4.2 Refusal to issue permit. If the application for a permit and the accompanying contract documents describing the work do not conform to the requirements of the technical codes or other pertinent laws or ordinances, the building official shall not issue a permit, but shall return the contract documents to the applicant with his refusal to issue such permit. Such refusal shall, when requested, be in writing and shall contain the reason for refusal. 
104.4.3 Identification of minimum premium policy. Except as otherwise provided in chapter 440, workers compensation, every employer shall, as a condition to receiving a building permit, show proof that it has secured compensation for its employees as provided in Florida Statutes, sections 440.10 and 440.38. 
104.4.4 Asbestos removal. Moving, removal or disposal of asbestos-containing materials on a residential building where the owner occupies the building, the building is not for sale or lease, and the work is performed according to the owner-builder limitations provided in this paragraph. To qualify for exemption under this paragraph, an owner must personally appear and sign the building permit application. The permitting agency shall provide the person with a disclosure statement in substantially the following form: 
Disclosure Statement 
State law requires asbestos abatement to be done by licensed contractors. You have applied for a permit under an exemption to that law. The exemption allows you, as the owner of your property, to act as your own asbestos abatement contractor even though you do not have a license. You must supervise the construction yourself. You may move, remove or dispose of asbestos-containing materials on a residential building where you occupy the building and the building is not for sale or lease, or the building is a farm outbuilding on your property. If you sell or lease such building within one (1) year after the asbestos abatement is complete, the law will presume that you intended to sell or lease the property at the time the work was done, which is a violation of this exemption. You may not hire an unlicensed person as your contractor. Your work must be done according to all local, state and federal laws and regulations which apply to asbestos abatement projects. It is your responsibility to make sure that people employed by you have licenses required by state law and by county or municipal licensing ordinances. 
104.4.5 Special foundation permit. When application for permit to erect or enlarge a building has been filed and pending issuance of such permit, the building official may, at his discretion, issue a special permit for the foundation only. The holder of such a special permit is proceeding at their own risk and without assurance that a permit for the remainder of the work will be granted nor that corrections will not be required in order to meet provisions of the technical codes. 
104.4.6 Public right-of-way. A permit shall not be given by the building official for the construction of any building, or for the alteration of any building where said building is to be changed and such change will affect the exterior walls, bays, balconies, or other appendages or projections fronting on any street, alley or public lane, or for the placing on any lot or premises of any building or structure removed from another lot or premises, unless the applicant has made application for right-of-way permits from the authority having jurisdiction over the street, alley or public lane. 
104.5 Conditions of the permit 
104.5.1 Permit intent. A permit issued shall be construed to be a license to proceed with the work and not as authority to violate, cancel, alter or set aside any of the provisions of the technical codes, nor shall issuance of a permit prevent the building official from thereafter requiring a correction of errors in plans, construction, or violations of this code. Every permit issued shall become invalid unless the work authorized by such permit is commenced within six (6) months after its issuance, or if the work authorized by such permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of six (6) months after the time the work is commenced. Failure to obtain an approved inspection within one hundred eighty (180) days of the previous approved inspection shall constitute suspension or abandonment. One (1) or more extensions of time, for periods not more than one hundred eighty (180) days each, may be allowed by the building official for the permit, provided the extension is requested in writing and justifiable cause is demonstrated prior to the expiration date. The building official shall record the extension of time granted. 
104.5.1.1 If work has commenced and the permit is revoked, becomes null and void, or expires because of lack of progress or abandonment, a new permit covering the proposed construction shall be obtained before proceeding with the work. 
104.5.1.2 If a new permit is not obtained within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date the initial permit became null and void, the building official is authorized to require that any work which has been commenced or completed be removed from the building site. Alternately, a new permit may be issued on application, providing the work in place and required to complete the structure meets all applicable regulations in effect at the time the initial permit became null and void and any regulations which may have become effective between the date of expiration and the date of issuance of the new permit. 
104.5.1.3 Work shall be considered to be in active progress when the permit has received an approved inspection within one hundred eighty (180) days. This provision shall not be applicable in case of civil commotion or strike or when the building work is halted due directly to judicial injunction, order or similar process. 
104.5.1.4 The fee for renewal, reissuance and extension of a permit shall be set forth by the administrative authority. 
104.5.1.5 Permits issued for the demolition of a structure shall expire sixty (60) days from the date of issuance. For a justifiable cause, one (1) extension of time for a period not exceeding thirty (30) days may be allowed. Such request shall be in writing to the building official. 
104.5.2 Permit issued on basis of an affidavit. Whenever a permit is issued in reliance upon an affidavit or whenever the work to be covered by a permit involves installation under conditions which, in the opinion of the building official, are hazardous or complex, the building official shall require that the architect or engineer who signed the affidavit or prepared the drawings or computations shall supervise such work. In addition, they shall be responsible for conformity to the permit, provide copies of inspection reports as inspections are performed, and upon completion make and file with the building official written affidavit that the work has been done in conformity to the reviewed plans and with the structural provisions of the technical codes. In the event such architect or engineer is not available, the owner shall employ in his stead a competent person or agency whose qualifications are reviewed by the building official. The building official shall ensure that any person conducting plans review is qualified as a plans examiner under Florida Statutes, part XII of chapter 468, and that any person conducting inspections is qualified as a building inspector under Florida Statues, part III of chapter 468. 
104.5.3 Plans. When the building official issues a permit, the building official shall endorse, in writing or by stamp, both sets of reviewed plans "Reviewed for Code Compliance." One (1) set of reviewed drawings shall be retained by the building official and the other set shall be returned to the applicant. The permit drawings shall be kept at the site of work and shall be open to inspection by the building official or his authorized representative. 
104.5.4 Work starting before permit issuance. Upon approval of the building official, the scope of work delineated in the building permit application and plans may be started prior to the final approval and issuance of the permit provided any work completed is entirely at risk of the permit applicant and the work does not proceed past the first required inspection. 
104.6 Fees 
104.6.1 Prescribed fees. A permit shall not be issued until fees authorized under Florida Statutes section 553.80 have been paid. Nor shall an amendment to a permit be released until the additional fee, if any, due to an increase in the estimated cost of the building, structure, electrical, plumbing, mechanical or gas systems, has been paid. 
104.6.2 Work commencing before permit issuance. Any person who commences any work on a building, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system before obtaining the building official's approval or the necessary permits shall be subject to a penalty of one hundred (100) percent of the usual permit fee in addition to the required permit fees or as provided by local ordinance. This provision shall not apply to emergency work when delay would clearly have placed life or property in imminent danger. But in all such cases the required permit(s) must be obtained within three (3) business days and any unreasonable delay in obtaining those permit(s) shall result in the charge of a double fee. The payment of a double fee shall not preclude or be deemed a substitute for prosecution for commencing work without first obtaining a permit. The building official may grant extensions of time or waive fees when justifiable cause has been demonstrated in writing. 
104.6.3 Accounting. The building official shall keep a permanent and accurate accounting of all permit fees and other monies collected, the names of all persons upon whose account the same was paid, along with the date and amount thereof. 
104.6.4 Schedule of permit fees. On all buildings, structures, electrical, plumbing, mechanical and gas systems or alterations requiring a permit, a fee for each permit shall be paid as required at the time of filing application, in accordance with the schedule as established by the applicable governing authority.

104.6.6 Building permit valuations. If, in the opinion of the building official, the valuation of building, alteration, structure, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing systems appears to be underestimated on the application, permit shall be denied, unless the applicant can show detailed estimates to meet the approval of the building official. Permit valuations shall include total cost, such as electrical, gas, mechanical, plumbing equipment and other systems, including materials and labor. The permit valuation may be calculated using the latest building valuation data published by the Southern Building Code Congress International or other applicable model code organization, at the option of the building official.

(Ord. No. 2013-3, § 1, 4-9-13) 
Sec. 6-108. - Scope. 
    The provisions of this article shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including but not limited to the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development. 
(Ord. No. 2013-3, § 1, 4-9-13) 
Sec. 6-109. - Intent. 
    The purposes of this article and the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
1.  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
2.  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
3.  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
4.  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
5.  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
6.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
7.  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and 
8.  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22.

c.  Eighty dollars ($80.00) if no permit is applied for and obtained after one hundred and five (105) days of the annual inspection and the matter will be referred to special code enforcement magistrate for action.

Any order of the special magistrate imposing late fees, attorney fees and costs may be forwarded by the city to a collection agency if not paid within thirty (30) days of the special magistrate's order.

Such repairs must be accomplished within the time provided in the notice of violation served pursuant to section 10-37. However, the existence of a current registration and license plate on a motor vehicle shall not be sufficient to show that a vehicle is not abandoned property if such vehicle has been left inoperable, unprotected, and unenclosed from the elements.

ARTICLE V. - VACATION RENTAL 
DIVISION 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 10-75. - Authority, scope and purpose. 
    This chapter is enacted under the home rule power of the City of Indian Harbour Beach in the interest of the health, peace, safety and general welfare. 
    F.S. § 509.013, provides a distinction between "transient public lodging establishments" which are rented, or advertised or held out for rental to guests more than three (3) times in a calendar year for periods of less than thirty (30) days or one (1) calendar month, whichever is less; and "nontransient public lodging establishments" which are rented, or advertised or held out for rental to guests for periods of at least thirty (30) days or one (1) calendar month, whichever is less. 
    F.S. § 509.242(1)(c), further provides for a subset of transient public lodging establishments, called "vacation rental" which is any unit or group of units in a condominium or cooperative or any individually or collectively owned single-family, two-family, three-family or four-family house or dwelling unit that is also a transient public lodging establishment, but that is not a timeshare project. 
    It is the intent of this chapter to regulate vacation rentals as defined by Florida Statutes, which are located in the R-1A, R-1AA, R-1AAA and R-2 zoning districts of the City of Indian Harbour Beach, which collectively are referred to herein as "Vacation Rentals". 
    In 2011, the Florida Legislature passed House Bill 883, (Chapter 2011-119, Laws of Florida), amending F.S. § 509.032(b), to provide that "[a] local law, ordinance, or regulation may not restrict the use of vacation rentals, prohibit vacation rentals, or regulate vacation rentals based solely on their classification, use or occupancy. This paragraph does not apply to any local law, ordinance, or regulation adopted on or before June 1, 2011." 
    In 2014, the Florida Legislature passed Senate Bill 356 (Chapter 2014-71, Laws of Florida), amending that same statute to read "[a] local law, ordinance, or regulation may not prohibit vacation rentals, or regulate the duration of frequency of rental of vacation rentals. This paragraph does not apply to any local law, ordinance, or regulation adopted on or before June 1, 2011." 
    The official statement of legislative intent of Senate Bill 356 as reflected in the House of Representatives' Final Bill Analysis, dated June 19, 2014, states that the "Effect of the Bill" is as follows: 
"The bill permits local governments to create regulation that distinguishes vacation rentals from other residential property. In the past, local government regulations have included noise, parking, registration, and signage requirements for vacation rentals. 
"The bill does not allow local governments to create regulations that would prohibit vacation rentals or restrict the duration or frequency of vacation rentals. These types of regulation remain preempted to the state. 
"The grandfather provision in existing law exempting any local law, ordinance, or regulation adopted on or before June 1, 2011, is maintained. Any local law, ordinance, or regulation passed before that date that prohibits or restricts vacation rentals based on the duration or frequency may continue to be enforced." 
    This chapter does not prohibit vacation rentals, or the duration or frequency of vacation rentals, nor is it the intention of the City of Indian Harbour Beach to do so, but rather this chapter is intended to address life safety and compatibility concerns in the interests of the health, peace, safety, and general welfare. 
( Ord. No. 2018-05, § 1, 8-8-18 ) 
Sec. 10-76. - Findings of facts. 
    Based on information presented to the city by residents of Indian Harbour Beach and owners and operators of vacation rentals, the practical first-hand experience and observations of city council members, common sense deductions of city council members based on long term experiences in Indian Harbour Beach, information learned by city council members from various residents, information from the U.S. Census, as well as evidence and testimony presented at public hearings before the city council, and on the Short-Term Rental Housing Restrictions White Paper, prepared by Robinson & Cole, Attorneys at Law, in 2011, prepared for the National Association of Realtors&reg;, the city council finds: 
(1)  Residents residing within their residential dwellings are inherently familiar with the local surroundings, local weather disturbances, local hurricane evacuation plans, and means of egress from their residential dwellings, thereby minimizing potential risks to themselves and their families. 
(2)  In contrast, transient occupants of vacation rentals, due to their transient nature, are typically not familiar with local surroundings, local weather disturbances, local hurricane evacuation plans, and means of egress from the vacation rentals in which they are staying, thereby increasing potential risks to themselves and their families, and putting an additional burden on, and potentially putting at risk, emergency personnel in the event of an emergency situation. 
(3)  Certain vacation rentals may be presently located within the R-1A, R-1AA, R-1AAA and R-2 zoning districts of the City of Indian Harbour Beach. 
(4)  Vacation rentals, left unregulated, can create negative impacts within residential neighborhoods due to excessive noise, parking and traffic problems, excessive use and impact on public services and public works, extreme size and/or greater occupancy. 
(5)  Vacation rentals situated within residential neighborhoods can disturb the quiet nature and atmosphere of the residential neighborhoods, and the quiet enjoyment of its residents. 
(6)  Vacation rentals located within established residential neighborhoods can create negative compatibility impacts relating to extreme noise levels, late night activities, on-street parking issues and traffic congestion. 
(7)  A residential dwelling is typically the single largest investment a family will make with the residents of the residential dwelling desiring the tranquility and peaceful enjoyment of their neighborhood without excessive noise and increased parking issues and traffic congestion caused by transient occupants of vacation rentals. 
(8)  According to the U.S. Census, (2010) the City of Indian Harbour Beach has an average household size of 1.68 persons.

    Any member who has attained the age of fifty-two (52), or more, is eligible for normal retirement benefits. Normal retirement under the plan is retirement from the service of the city on or after the normal retirement date. In such event, payment of retirement income will be governed by the following provisions of this section. 
(1)  The normal retirement date of each member shall be the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date on which he has attained the age of fifty-two (52) years and completed ten (10) years of credited service. A member who retires after his normal retirement date shall continue to accrue credited service time until the date of his actual retirement. A member shall be encouraged to retire no later than the first day of the month next following the date on which he attains the age of sixty (60) years, and for actuarial purposes, all evaluations of the system shall assume that a member will retire at the age of sixty (60) years. 
(2)  The amount of monthly retirement income payable to a member who retires on or after his normal retirement date shall be an amount equal to the number of his years of credited service multiplied by three (3) percent of his average final compensation.

(3)  The monthly retirement income payable in the event of normal retirement will be payable on the first day of each month. The first payment will be made on the member's normal retirement date, or on the first day of the month coincident with or next following his actual retirement, if later, and the last payment will be the payment due next preceding the member's death; except that, in the event the member dies after his retirement but before he has received retirement benefits for a period of ten (10) years, the same monthly benefit will be paid to the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) as designated by the member for the balance of such ten (10) year period, or, if no beneficiary is designated, to the surviving spouse, descendants, heirs at law or estate of the member, as provided in Florida Statutes, Section 185.162. If a member continues in the service of the city beyond his normal retirement date and dies prior to his date of actual retirement, without an option made pursuant to Florida Statutes, Section 185.161 being in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made for a period of ten (10) years to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the member as if the member had retired on the date on which his death occurred, or, if no beneficiary is designated, to the surviving spouse, descendants, heirs at law or estate of the member as provided in Florida Statutes, Section 185.162.

(a)  Early retirement under the plan is retirement from the service of the city, with the consent of the city, as of the first day of any calendar month which is prior to the police officer's normal retirement date under section 13-40 but subsequent to the date as of which the police officer has both attained the age of fifty (50) years and completed ten (10) years of contributing service. In the event of early retirement, payment of retirement income will be governed as follows: 
(1)  The early retirement date shall be the first day of the calendar month coincident with or immediately following the date a police officer retires from the service of the city under the provisions of this section prior to his or her normal retirement date. 
(2)  The monthly amount of retirement income payable to a police officer who retires prior to his or her normal retirement date under the provisions of section 13-40 shall be an amount computed as described in subsection 13-40(2), taking into account his or her credited service to the date of actual retirement and his or her final monthly compensation as of such date, such amount of retirement income to be actuarially reduced to take into account the police officer's younger age and the earlier commencement of retirement income payments. In no event shall the early retirement reduction exceed three (3) percent for each year by which the member's age at retirement preceded the member's normal retirement age, as provided in subsection 13-40(1). 
(3)  The retirement income payable in the event of early retirement will be payable on the first day of each month. The first payment will be made on the police officer's early retirement date and the last payment will be the payment due next preceding the retired police officer's death; except that, in the event the police officer dies before receiving retirement benefits for a period of ten (10) years, the same monthly benefit will be paid to the beneficiary designated by the police officer for the balance of such ten-year period, or, if no designated beneficiary is surviving, the same monthly benefit for the balance of such ten-year period shall be payable to the estate of such deceased police officer, provided that in any of such cases the board of trustees, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income payments be paid in a lump sum. Any payment made to any person pursuant to this subsection shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the plan with regard to such deceased police officer and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder.

In the event that any disabled member could otherwise still be employed, or re-employed as a police officer, within the department, except that the position for which he is qualified is not available due to being currently filled, the benefit shall be payable only until such position again becomes available. The board may require, at its expense, periodic medical re-examination of disabled members.

(c)  Injury or disease sustained while serving in the armed forces; 
(d)  Injury or disease sustained while working for anyone other than the city and arising out of such employment.

(7)  Medical board. The board of trustees shall designate a medical board to be composed of three (3) physicians, but limited to either M. D.s and/or D. O.s, who shall arrange for and pass upon all medical examinations required under the provisions of this article, shall investigate all essential statements or certificates made by or on behalf of a member in connection with an application for disability retirement and shall report in writing to the board of trustees its conclusions and recommendations upon all matters referred to it.

(1)  A member's credited service and accrued benefit under the system shall be determined on the date of the member's election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. The member shall not accrue any additional credited service or any additional benefits under the system (except for any additional benefits provided under any cost-of living adjustment in the system or any other benefit improvements which are made specifically applicable to retirees or DROP participants) while the member is a participant in the DROP. After a member commences participation, the member shall not be permitted to again contribute to the system nor shall they be eligible for disability or preretirement death benefits. 
(2)  No amounts shall be paid to a member of the system while the member is a participant in the DROP. Unless otherwise specified in the system, if a member's participation in the DROP is terminated other than by terminating employment as a police officer, no amounts shall be paid to the member from the system until the member terminates employment as a police officer. Unless otherwise specified in the system, amounts transferred from the system to the member's DROP account shall be paid directly to the member only on the termination of their employment as a police officer. 
(3)  The city shall not be obligated to provide a participant in the DROP with any health insurance subsidy. 
(e)  Funding. 
(1)  Establishment of DROP account. A DROP account shall be established for each member participating in the DROP. A member's DROP account shall consist of amounts transferred to the DROP under subsection (d)(2), and earnings or interest on those amounts. 
(2)  Transfers from retirement system. 
(a)  As of the first day of each month of a member's period of participation in the DROP, the monthly retirement benefit the member would have received under the system had the member terminated employment as a police officer and elected to receive monthly benefit payments thereunder shall be transferred to the member's DROP account, except as otherwise provided for in subsection (c)(2). A member's period of participation in the DROP shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of subsections (b)(2) and (c), but in no event shall it continue past the date the member terminates employment as a police officer. 
(b)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c)(2), a member's DROP account under this subsection shall be debited or credited with earnings after each fiscal year quarter with interest equivalent to the interest earned on the police officer's retirement system established in article III of chapter 13 of the Code of Ordinances of the city. 
(c)  A member's DROP account shall only be credited or debited with earnings or interest and monthly benefits while the member is a participant in the DROP and will cease after the member dies, retires or terminates their employment as a police officer. 
(f)  Distribution of DROP accounts on termination of employment. 
(1)  Eligibility for benefits. A member shall receive the balance in the member's DROP account in accordance with the provisions of this subsection upon termination of employment as a police officer. Except as provided in subsection (l), no amounts shall be paid to a member from the DROP prior to termination of employment as a police officer. 
(g)  Form of distribution. 
(1)  Unless the member elects otherwise, distribution of the member's DROP account shall be made in a cash lump sum, subject to the direct rollover provisions set forth in subsection (i). A member may, however, elect in such time and manner as the board shall prescribe, that their DROP distributions be used to purchase a non-forfeitable fixed annuity payable in such form as the member may elect. Elections under this paragraph shall be in writing and shall be made in such time or manner as the board shall determine. If the annuity form selected is not a qualified joint and fifty (50) percent survivor annuity with the member's spouse as beneficiary, the annuity payable to the member and thereafter to the member's beneficiary shall be subject to the incidental death benefit in accordance with the Indian Harbour Beach Police Pension Plan. 
(2)  If a member dies before their benefit is paid, their DROP account shall be paid to their beneficiary in such optional form as the beneficiary may select. If no beneficiary designation is made, the DROP account shall be distributed to the member's estate. 
(h)  Date of payment distribution. 
(1)  Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (f), distribution of a member's DROP account shall be made as soon as administratively practicable following the member's termination of employment. 
(2)  In lieu of a distribution as described in paragraph (1) above, a member may, in accordance with such procedures as the board shall prescribe, elect to have the distribution of their DROP account made as of the first day of any month coincident with or following their termination of employment as a police officer; provided, however, payments shall be made before the distribution date elected by the member to the extent necessary to comply with the provisions of subsections (k) and (l). 
(i)  Age seventy and one-half (701/2) required distribution. In no event shall the provisions of subsection (f) operate so as to allow the distribution of a member's DROP account to be later than the April 1 following the later of the calendar year in which the member terminates employment as a police officer or attains age seventy and one-half (701/2). In the event a member is required to receive payment while in service under the provisions of this subsection, the member shall receive one lump sum payment on or before their required beginning date equal to the member's entire DROP account balance and annual lump sum payments thereafter of amounts credited to their DROP account during each calendar year. Upon the member's subsequent termination of employment, payment of this DROP account shall be made in accordance with the provisions of subsection (g). 
(j)  Proof of death and right of beneficiary or other person. The board may require and rely upon such proof of death and such evidence of the right of any beneficiary or other person to receive the value of a deceased member's DROP account as the board may deem proper and its determination of the right of that beneficiary or other person to receive payment shall be conclusive. 
(k)  Distribution limitation. Notwithstanding any other provision of subsection (f) all distributions from the DROP shall conform to the provisions of the Indian Harbour Beach Police Pension Plan. Further, such provisions shall override any DROP provision that is inconsistent with the Indian Harbour Beach Police Pension Plan. 
(l)  Direct rollover of certain distributions. This subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2012. Notwithstanding any provision of the DROP to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this subsection, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly by the DROP to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover as otherwise provided under the Indian Harbour Beach Police Pension Plan herein incorporated by reference. 
    The benefits will be paid out over the lifetime of the individual participant in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code 401(a)(9). 
(m)  Administration of DROP. 
(1)  Board administers the DROP. The general administration of the DROP, the responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the DROP, and the responsibility of overseeing the investment of the DROP's assets shall be placed in the board. The members of the board may adopt such administrative procedures and regulations as they deem desirable for the conduct of their affairs; may authorize one or more of their number of any agent to execute or deliver any instrument or make any payment on their behalf; may retain counsel, employ agents and provide for such clerical accounting, actuarial and consulting services as they may require in carrying out the provisions of the DROP, and may allocate among themselves or delegate to other persons all or such portion of their duties under the DROP, other than those granted to them as trustee under any trust agreement adopted for use in implementing the DROP, as they, in their sole discretion, shall decide. A trustee shall not vote on any question relating exclusively to them. 
(n)  Individual accounts, records and reports. The board shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, records showing the operation and condition of the DROP, including records showing the individual balances in each member's DROP account, and the board shall keep, or cause to be kept, in convenient form such data as may be necessary for the valuation of the assets and liabilities of the DROP. The board shall prepare or cause to be prepared and distributed to members participating in the DROP and other individuals or filed with the appropriate governmental agencies, as the case may be distributed or filed for the DROP pursuant to the article, the applicable portions of the Act and any other applicable laws. 
(o)  Establishment of rules. Subject to the limitations of the DROP, the board from time to time shall establish rules for the administration of the DROP and the transaction of its business. The board shall have discretionary authority to construe and interpret the DROP (including but not limited to determination of an individual's eligibility for DROP participation, the right and amount of any benefit payable under the DROP and the date on which any individual ceases to be a participant in the DROP). The determination of the board as to the interpretation of the DROP or its determination of any disputed questions shall be conclusive and final to the extent permitted by applicable law. The board shall also oversee the investment of the DROP's assets. 
(p)  General provisions. 
(1)  Amendment of the DROP. The DROP may be amended by an ordinance of the city at any time and from time to time, and retroactively if deemed necessary or appropriate, to amend in whole or in part any or all of this provision of the DROP. However, except as otherwise provided by law, no amendment shall make it possible for any part of the DROP's funds to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of persons entitled to benefits under the DROP. No amendment shall be made which has the effect of decreasing the balance of the DROP account of any member. 
(2)  Facility of payment. If the board shall find that a member or other person entitled to a benefit under the DROP is unable to care for their affairs because of illness or accident or is a minor, the board may direct that any benefit due them, unless claim shall have been made for the benefit by a duly appointed legal representative, be paid to their spouse, a child, a parent, or other blood relative, or to a person with whom they reside. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of the liabilities of the DROP for that benefit. 
(3)  Information. Each member, beneficiary or other person entitled to a benefit, before any benefit shall be payable to the member or on the member's account under the DROP, shall file with the board the information that it shall require to establish their rights and benefits under the DROP. 
(4)  Prevention of escheat. 
(a)  The board, upon the death of a member and if no beneficiary designation is made, shall pay the benefits in the member's DROP account to the personal representative of the estate of the deceased member or as otherwise directed by a court order. 
(b)  If the board cannot ascertain the whereabouts of any person to whom a payment is due under the DROP, the board may, no earlier than three (3) years from the date such payment is due, mail a notice of such due and owing payment to the last known address of such person, as shown on the records of the board or the city. If such person has not made written claim therefore within three (3) months of the date of the mailing, the board may, if it so elects and upon receiving advice from counsel to the DROP, direct that such payment and all remaining payments otherwise due such person be canceled on the records of the DROP. Upon such cancellation, the DROP shall have no further liability therefore except that, in the event such person or their beneficiary later notified the board of their whereabouts and request the payment or payments due to them under the DROP, the amount so applied shall be paid to them in accordance with the provisions of the DROP. 
(q)  Written elections, notification. 
(1)  Any elections, notifications or designations made by a member pursuant to the provisions of the DROP shall be made in writing and filed with the board in a time and manner determined by the board under rules uniformly applicable to all employees similarly situated. The board reserves the right to change from the time and manner for making notifications elections or designations by members under the DROP if it determines after due deliberation that such action is justified in that it improves the administration of the DROP. In the event of a conflict between the provisions for making an election, notification or designation set forth in the DROP and such new administrative procedures, those new administration procedures shall prevail. 
(2)  Each member or retiree who has a DROP account shall be responsible for furnishing the board with their current address and any subsequent changes in their address. Any notice required to be given to a member or retiree hereunder shall be deemed given if directed to them at the last such address given to the board and mailed by registered or certified United States mail. If any check mailed by registered or certified United States mail to such address is returned, mailing of checks will be suspended until such time as the member or retiree notifies the board of their address. 
(r)  Benefits not guaranteed. All benefits payable to a member from the DROP shall be paid only from the assets of the member's DROP account and neither the city nor the board shall have any duty or liability to furnish the DROP with any funds, securities, or other assets except to the extent required by any applicable law. 
(s)  Construction. 
(1)  The DROP shall be construed, regulated, and administered under the laws of Florida, except where other applicable law controls. 
(2)  The titles and headings of the subsections in this article are for convenience only. In the case of ambiguity or inconsistency, the text rather than the titles or headings shall control. 
(t)  Forfeiture of retirement benefits. Nothing in this section shall be construed to remove DROP participants from the application of any forfeiture provisions applicable to the system. DROP participants shall be subject to forfeiture of all retirement benefits, including DROP benefits. 
(u)  Limitation of liability. 
a.  The trustees shall not incur any liability individually or on behalf of any other individuals for any act or failure to act made in good faith in relation to the DROP or the funds of the DROP. 
b.  Neither the board nor any trustee of the board shall be responsible for any reports furnished by any accountant or an actuary, and on all opinions of counsel. The board shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in reliance upon such expert, accountant, actuary or counsel, and all actions taken or suffered in such reliance shall be conclusive upon any person with any interest in the DROP. 
(v)  Expenses. To compensate the system for the expenses of administering and operating the DROP, each member's DROP account shall be reviewed and subject to increase or decrease annually. The initial expense charge of sixty dollars ($60.00) shall be deducted from the member's DROP account after each fiscal year. 
(w)  Cost of living increase. Participants DROP accounts shall be adjusted in accordance with section 13-43 of the Code of Ordinances of the city.

(e)  After the effective date of this section, the city council shall use the goals, objectives and policies set forth in the comprehensive plan in the evaluation of any proposed change of land use, change of zoning or issuance of any development order. In addition to such goals, objectives and policies, the city council also reserves the right to utilize the following factors in any such evaluation: 
(1)  The effect of the proposal on both the particular property with which such proposal is concerned and surrounding properties in general. 
(2)  The amount of undeveloped land suitable for such proposal within the general area in question. 
(3)  The amount of undeveloped land suitable for such proposal within the city. 
(4)  Whether denial of the proposal would deny any property owner all beneficial economic use of his property. 
(f)  Nothing in this section or in the city's comprehensive plan adopted by this section shall limit or modify the rights of any person to complete any development that has been authorized by a final development order or other permit or license granted by the city prior to the date of adoption of this section. Any construction or development accomplished as authorized by such order, permit or license shall comply with all of the terms and provisions of all applicable ordinances of the city in effect as of the date of issuance of such order, permit or license.

A letter to the city meeting the requirements of this paragraph shall be deemed to be sufficient; provided, that such letter is actually received by the city within the thirty-day period specified herein above. 
(2)  The city council shall conduct a public hearing with respect to the appeal and shall receive at such public hearing testimony, evidence and comments from the appellant and all other persons having standing to contest development orders under Chapter 163, Florida Statutes. Notice of the date and time of such public hearing shall be given to the appellant by certified mail, return receipt requested, and to the general public by publication of such notice in a newspaper of general circulation in Brevard County, Florida. Such publication shall be made no later than ten (10) days prior to the day on which such public hearing is scheduled to be held. 
(3)  The appellant shall be required to pay to the city a filing fee for the appeal equal to the cost of publication of the notice described in the preceding paragraph of this section. Such filing fee shall be paid after the cost of such publication is determined, but in any event prior to the date of the public hearing on the appeal. 
(4)  Upon consideration of the evidence, testimony and comments received at the public hearing, the city council shall have the power and authority to deny the relief sought by the appellant or modify the issuance or denial of the order or permit which is the subject of the appeal in such manner as to cause the appellant to avoid the loss of all beneficial economic use of his property. Action taken by the city council with respect to any appeal made pursuant to this section shall be consistent with the comprehensive plan and the provisions of subsections (b) through (f) of this section.

Sec. 16.5-1. - Finding and purpose. 
(a)  The city council of the City of Indian Harbour Beach, Florida, finds that uncontrolled drainage and development of land has a significant adverse impact upon the health, safety and welfare of the Indian Harbour Beach community. Further, the city council finds more specifically as follows: 
(1)  Stormwater runoff is capable of carrying pollutants into receiving bodies, thereby degrading water quality; 
(2)  The increase in nutrients, such as phosphorous and nitrogen, accelerates eutrophication of receiving water bodies, thereby adversely affecting flora and fauna; 
(3)  Improperly channeling water increases the velocity of stormwater runoff, thereby increasing erosion and sedimentation; 
(4)  Construction requiring the alteration of natural topography and removal of vegetation tends to increase erosion; 
(5)  Siltation of water bodies resulting from increased erosion decreases the capacity of such water bodies to hold and transport water, interferes with navigation and harms flora and fauna; 
(6)  Impervious surfaces increase the volume and rate of stormwater runoff and allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby decreasing groundwater recharge; 
(7)  Improperly managed stormwater runoff may increase the incidents of flooding and the level of floods which occur, thereby endangering property and human life; 
(8)  Improperly managed stormwater runoff may interfere with the maintenance of optimum salinity in estuarine areas, thereby disrupting biological productivity; 
(9)  Substantial economic losses may result from such adverse impacts upon the waters of the city's ecosystem; 
(10)  Sound stormwater utility management practices result in the avoidance of future problems concerning the development of land and the maintenance of the quality of the city's environment. 
(b)  The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain and enhance both the immediate and long-term health, safety and general welfare of the citizens, residents and inhabitants of the city. In order to effectuate this stated purpose, this chapter has the following objectives: 
(1)  To establish a stormwater management program in the city which is mutually compatible with those developed by the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation, the St. Johns River Water Management, Brevard County and other local government entities; 
(2)  To develop a city stormwater management program within the city limits to be responsible for the construction, operation and maintenance of stormwater device; for stormwater system planning; for review of development plans for compliance with stormwater management codes; and for lake and river quality management; 
(3)  To create one or more stormwater management system benefit areas and adopt stormwater utility fees or assessments sufficient to plan, construct, operate and maintain stormwater management systems throughout the city; 
(4)  To establish and set aside, as a continuing source of revenue, other funds sufficient to plan, construct, operate and maintain the stormwater management systems throughout the city; 
(5)  To encourage productive and enjoyable harmony between humanity and nature; 
(6)  To protect, restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity to community waters; 
(7)  To prevent individuals, business organizations and government from causing harm of the community by activities which adversely affect water resources; 
(8)  To encourage the construction of drainage systems which aesthetically and functionally approximate natural systems; 
(9)  To encourage the protection of natural systems and the use of such natural systems in ways which do not impair their beneficial functioning; 
(10)  To encourage the use of drainage systems which minimize the consumption of electrical energy or petroleum fuels in order to move water, remove pollutants and maintain said systems; 
(11)  To minimize the transport of pollutants to community waters; 
(12)  To maintain or restore groundwater levels; 
(13)  To protect, maintain or to restore natural salinity levels in estuarine areas; 
(14)  To minimize erosion and sedimentation; 
(15)  To prevent damage to wetlands; 
(16)  To prevent damage from flooding, while recognizing that natural fluctuations in water levels are beneficial; 
(17)  To protect, restore and maintain the habitat for fish and wildlife; 
(18)  To ensure that attainment of these objectives by requiring the approval and implementation of a stormwater management program for all activities which may have an adverse impact upon community waters; and 
(19)  To seek interlocal agreement with Brevard County to ensure cooperation efforts toward joint development of compatible and efficient stormwater management programs.

(1)  Such vehicle (specifying the license number and listing the parking violation notices issued to such vehicle) has been immobilized pursuant to and by the authority of this section; and 
(2)  The owner of such immobilized vehicle shall be permitted to repossess, or secure release of the vehicle, upon compliance with either of the following alternative procedures: 
a.  Payment to the comptroller, or designee, of the total civil penalty, including delinquent fees, for each violation and an immobilization service fee set forth in section 19-21, penalty, as amended. 
b.  By requesting an administrative hearing, within fifteen (15) days of the city's mailing of notice. 
(f)  If, after contacting the appropriate state agency, which acts as a custodian of vehicle registration and license tag records, the police department is unable to determine the motor vehicle owner's address, the motor vehicle may be immobilized in accordance with the provisions of this section, except that the mailing notice, under subsection (2), is not required. 
(g)  If the owner of the immobilized vehicle does not make arrangements for the removal of the immobilization device within twenty-four (24) hours of the time such motor vehicle is immobilized, then the police department may remove such vehicle to a garage, or other place of safety, in accordance with section 19-27. Any towing service charges, incurred pursuant to this subsection, shall be additional costs to be assessed to the registered owner of the vehicle. 
(h)  No vehicle immobilized, in accordance with this section, shall be immobilized by any means other than by the use of an impoundment device or other mechanism, which will cause no damage to such vehicle, unless the vehicle is moved while such device or mechanism is in place. 
(i)  No person, except as may be authorized by the police department, shall remove, attempt to remove, tamper with, in any way damage, or alter the immobilization device. A violation of this subsection shall be punishable as set forth in section 1-11(a)(2), as amended.

(a)  The code inspectors have the primary duty of enforcing the various codes and ordinances and initiating enforcement proceedings before the special magistrate. No special magistrate shall have the power to initiate such enforcement proceedings. 
(b)  Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d), if a violation of the codes or ordinances is found, the code inspector shall notify the respondent of the violation and give the respondent a reasonable time, in light of the nature of the violation, to correct the violation. Should the violation continue beyond the time specified for correction, the code inspector shall set a hearing before the special magistrate and notify the respondent of the hearing pursuant Section 162.12, Florida Statutes. If the violation is a recurring violation or if the violation is not corrected by the time specified for correction by the code inspector, the case may be presented to the code enforcement special magistrate even if the violation has been corrected prior to the special magistrate hearing, and the notice shall so state. 
(c)  If the code enforcement officer has reasonable belief that a repeat violation has been committed, the code inspector shall set a hearing before the special magistrate and notify the respondent of the hearing pursuant Section 162.12, Florida Statutes, and is not required to give the person a reasonable time to correct the violation prior to setting the hearing. 
(d)  If the code inspector has reason to believe a violation or the condition causing the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the code inspector shall make a reasonable effort to notify the violator and may immediately set a hearing before the special magistrate. 
(e)  Code enforcement will accept and investigate complaints from both named and anonymous sources. However, if after two (2) complaints have been filed against a person and/or property and no violations have been identified within a one (1) year period, the city manager may require that any subsequent complaints against that person and/or property be written and under oath and/or otherwise limit further investigation.

(1)  Disclose, in writing, the existence and the nature of the proceeding to the prospective transferee. 
(2)  Deliver to the prospective transferee a copy of the pleadings, notices, and other materials relating to the code enforcement proceeding received by the transferor. 
(3)  Disclose, in writing, to the prospective transferee that the new owner will be responsible for compliance with the applicable code and with orders issued in the code enforcement proceeding. 
(4)  File a notice with the code enforcement official of the transfer of the property, with the identity and address of the new owner and copies of the disclosures made to the new owner, within five (5) days after the date of the transfer. 
(5)  If the property is transferred before the hearing, the proceeding shall not be dismissed, but the new owner shall be provided a reasonable period of time to correct the violation before the hearing is held. Nothing herein shall prevent the city from continuing to prosecute the pending code enforcement proceeding to its conclusion against either the previous owner and/or the new owner.

(b)  Representation. Each case before the special magistrate shall be presented either by the city attorney, by the code inspector or by the city manager or designee. If the city prevails in prosecuting a case it shall be entitled to recover all costs incurred in prosecuting the case before the special magistrate and such costs may be included in the lien authorized by Section 162.07(2), Florida Statutes. Any person accused of a violation may be represented by counsel at the hearing. 
(c)  Order of procedure and rules of evidence. At any given hearing, the special magistrate shall first take testimony and receive evidence from the city, and the city shall have the burden of proving the existence of the alleged violation by the preponderance of the evidence. At the conclusion of the presentation of the evidence of the city the alleged violator may present a case and submit evidence. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental procedural due process shall be observed and shall govern the said proceedings. All testimony shall be under oath and recorded. 
(d)  Findings and orders. At the conclusion of the hearing, the special magistrate shall make a finding of fact, based on the evidence of record, and conclusions of law, and shall issue an order affording such relief as may be consistent with the powers granted herein. The findings and order shall be presented in written form and shall be served personally or by certified mail/return receipt requested upon the violator. The order may include a notice that the order must be complied with by a specific date and that a fine may be imposed if the order is not complied with by said date as provided Section 162.09(1), Florida Statutes, the order may specify the amount of the fine to be imposed and the date on which the fine will commence if the violation is not corrected. If the city prevails then the cost of prosecution shall be included in the lien authorized under section 21-10. The cost of repairs may be included along with the fine if the order is not complied with by said date. A certified copy of such order may be recorded in the public records of the county and shall constitute notice to all subsequent purchases, successors in interest, or as assigned, if the violation concerns with real property and the findings therein shall be binding upon the violator and, if the violation concerns real property, any subsequent purchases, successors in interests, or assigns. If an order is recorded in the public records pursuant to this subsection and the order is compiled with by the date specified in the order, the special magistrate shall issue an order acknowledging compliance that shall be recorded in the public records. A hearing is not required to issue such an order acknowledging compliance provided by the general laws of Florida applicable to code enforcement. 
(e)  [Appeal]. An aggrieved party, including the city may appeal a final administrative order of the special magistrate to the circuit court. Such appeal shall not be a hearing de novo but shall be limited to appellate review of the record created before the special magistrate. An appeal shall be filed within thirty (30) days of the execution of the order to be appealed. 
( Ord. No. 2014-2, § 1, 4-8-14 ) 
Sec. 21-10. - Administrative fines; cost of repairs; liens. 
(a)  The special magistrate, may either in the initial order or upon notification by code enforcement officer that an order has not been complied with or finding that a repeat violation has been committed, order the violator to pay a fine in an amount specified in this section for each day the violation continues past the date set by the special magistrate for compliance or, in the case of a repeat violation, for each day the repeat violation continues, beginning with the date the repeat violation is found to have occurred by the code inspector. In addition, if the special magistrate finds that the violation is a violation described in subsection 21-9(d), the special magistrate shall notify the city of such findings. The city shall then have the right and power to make all reasonable repairs which are required to bring the property into compliance and charge the violator with the reasonable cost of the repairs along with the fine imposed pursuant to this section. Making such repairs does not create a continuing obligation on the part of the city to make further repairs or to maintain the property and does not create any liability against the city for any damages to the property if such repairs were completed in good faith. If a finding of a violation or repeat violation has been made as provided by this part, a hearing shall not be necessary for issuance of the order imposing the fine. If, after due notice and hearing, the special magistrate finds a violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, he may order the violator to pay a fine as specified in subsection (b). 
(b)  Fines. 
1.  A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall not exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per day for a first violation and shall not exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day for a repeat violation, and in addition, may include all cost of repairs pursuant to this subsection and cost of prosecution provided in subsection 21-9(d). However, if the special magistrate finds the violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may impose a fine not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per violation. 
2.  In determining the amount of the fine, if any, the special magistrate shall consider the following factors; 
(a)  The gravity of the violation; 
(b)  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; 
(c)  Any previous violations committed by the violator; 
(c)  The special magistrate may reduce a fine imposed pursuant to this section. If a violator desires to request reconsideration of a fine, the following procedures must be followed: 
1.  Any order issued to the violator must be complied with. 
2.  A written request must be made to the code inspector for an inspection for compliance with the order issued. 
3.  After the code inspector has certified in writing that the prior order of the special magistrate has been complied with, the violator must, within twenty (20) days of such certification by the code inspector, request in writing to the code inspector, reconsideration of the fine by the special magistrate. 
(d)  A certified copy of an order imposing a fine, or a fine plus repair cost may be recorded in the public records and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order shall be enforceable in the same manner as a court judgement by the sheriffs of this state, including execution and levy against the personal property of the violator, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgement except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed pursuant to this part shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until judgement is rendered in a suit to foreclose on a lien filed pursuant to this section, whichever occurs first. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this section runs in favor of the city, and the city may execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered pursuant to this section. After three (3) months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the special magistrate may authorize the city attorney to foreclose on the lien. No lien created pursuant to the provisions of this part may be foreclosed on real property which is a homestead.

ARTICLE X. - APPLICATION OF DISTRICT REGULATIONS 
    The regulations set by this ordinance within each district shall be minimum regulations and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of structure or land, except as hereinafter provided. 

Sec. 1. - [Compliance generally.] 
    No building, structure, or land shall hereafter be used or occupied, and no building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered in any manner unless the resulting building, structure or land conforms with all of the regulations specified herein for the district in which such building, structure, or land is located. 
Sec. 2. - [Double use of required spaces.] 
    No part of a yard, open space, off-street parking space or loading space required in connection with any building by this ordinance shall be included as part of a yard, open space, off-street parking space, or loading space required for any building by this ordinance except that irrevocable cross parking easements may be used to meet the off-street parking requirements in the C-P, B-1, M-1, and P-1 zoning districts for properties connected by a common means of ingress and egress. 
(Ord. No. 2011-4, § 2, 10-25-11) 
Sec. 3. - [Reduction of yards and lots.] 
    No building permit shall be issued for any yard or lot existing at the time of passage of this ordinance if the dimension or area is reduced below the minimum requirements set forth herein. Yards or lots created after the effective date of this zoning code shall meet the minimum requirements established by this zoning code.

ARTICLE XI. - NONCONFORMITIES 

Sec. 1. - Intent. 
    Within the districts established by this ordinance, or amendments which may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures, uses of land and structures and characteristics of use which were lawful before this ordinance was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted by the terms of this ordinance or future amendments. It is the intent of this ordinance to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their continuation. Such uses are declared by this ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. It is further the intent of this ordinance that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
Sec. 2. - Extension and enlargement. 
    A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of a structure and land shall not be extended or enlarged. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this zoning code shall be deemed to require a change in plan, construction, or designated use of any building for which a development order has been issued for a development prior to the effective date of adoption of this zoning code or amendments hereto. 
(Ord. No. 2011-4, § 3, 10-25-11) 
Sec. 3. - Nonconforming lots of record. 
    In any district in which dwelling units are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this ordinance, dwelling units and customary accessory buildings maybe erected on any lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, which are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and other requirements not involving area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of area, width, or yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the zoning board of appeals. If two (2) or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this ordinance, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of this ordinance and no portion of said, parcel shall be used or sold which does not meet lot width and area requirements established by this ordinance, unless the portion which is in excess of the lot width requirements is sold in order to create a lot meeting the requirements of the ordinance or as an addition to the zoning parcel. 
(Ord. No. 2011-4, § 3, 10-25-11) 
Sec. 4. - Nonconforming uses of land. 
    Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, lawful use of land exists that is made no longer permissible under the terms of this ordinance as enacted or amended, such use may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, not extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, unless such use is changed to a use permitted by this ordinance in the district in which use is located. 
(2)  No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance. 
(3)  If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason at no fault of the owner of the land for a period of more than sixty (60) consecutive days, subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this ordinance for the district in which such land is located. For purposes herein the term "no fault" means any act of God which causes the use of the land to cease for the period described herein. 
(4)  No additional structure which does not conform to the requirements of this ordinance shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land. 
(Ord. No. 2011-4, § 3, 10-25-11) 
Sec. 5. - Nonconforming structures. 
    Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance that could not be built under the terms of this ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity. 
(2)  Any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity. 
(3)  Should such structure be destroyed by any means to any extent of more than fifty (50) percent of its replacement cost at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance. 
(4)  Should such structure be moved for any reason and distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located after it is moved. 
Sec. 6. - Nonconforming uses of structures or of structures and premises in combination. 
    If a lawful use involving individual structures, or of a structure and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, that would not be allowed in the district under the terms of this ordinance, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this ordinance in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located. 
(2)  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building. 
(3)  Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which such structure is located, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. 
(4)  Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. "Destruction" for the purpose of this ordinance is defined as damage to an extent of more than fifty (50) per cent of the replacement cost at time of destruction. 
Any nonconformity not involving the use of a principal structure, including, but not limited to, open storage, building supplies, vehicle, mobile home, implement and machinery storage, junkyards, and commercial animal yards, shall be discontinued within two (2) years of the effective date of this ordinance or amendment. 
(Ord. No. 2011-4, § 3, 10-25-11) 
Sec. 7. - Abandonment. 
    A nonconforming use of a building or premises which has been abandoned shall not thereafter be returned to such nonconforming use. A nonconforming use shall be considered abandoned: 
(1)  When the intent of the owner to discontinue the use is apparent; 
(2)  When the characteristics equipment and the furnishings of the nonconforming use have been removed from the premises and have not been replaced by similar equipment within six (6) months, unless other facts show intention to resume the nonconforming use; 
(3)  When it has been replaced by a conforming use; or 
(4)  Where the use is discontinued or abandoned six (6) months, or for eighteen (18) months during any three-year period. 
    However, notwithstanding the above, if a current business tax certificate/receipt is on file with the city for the specific location there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the use has not been abandoned. 
(Ord. No. 2011-4, § 3, 10-25-11) 
Sec. 8. - Repairs and maintenance. 
    On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, ordinary repairs, or repair or replacement of nonload-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, may be done provided that the cubic content of the building as it existed at the time of passage or amendment of this ordinance shall not be increased. Nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official. 
Sec. 9. - Special exceptions/conditional land use. 
    For purposes of this article, a special exception and a conditional land use as defined in the ordinance shall not be deemed to be a nonconforming use. 
Sec. 10. - Temporary uses. 
    The casual, intermittent, temporary or illegal use of land or structures shall not be sufficient to establish the existence of a nonconforming use. A nonconforming use shall not be validated by the adoption of this ordinance unless it complies with the definitions of this ordinance and the terms and conditions of this article.

Sec. 10. - District and intent: PUD, Planned Unit Development. 
    Planned unit development, or PUD, is an area of land developed as a single entity, or in approved stages in conformity with a final development plan by a developer or group of developers acting jointly, which is totally planned to provide for a variety of residential and compatible uses and common open space. 
[I.]  Definitions. For the purpose of this district, certain words and terms used herein shall be defined as follows: 
(A)  Common open space. A parcel or parcels of land, or a combination of land and water within the site designated as a planned unit development, and designed and intended for the use or enjoyment of residents of the planned unit development. All common open space shall be improved to the extent necessary to complement the residential uses and may contain compatible and complementary structures for the benefit and enjoyment of the residents of the planned unit development. 
(B)  Development plan. The total site plan of a planned unit development drawn in conformity with the requirements of this section. Said development plan shall specify and clearly illustrate the location, relationship, design, nature and character of all primary and secondary uses, public and private easements, structures, parking areas, public and private roads, and common open space. 
(C)  Preliminary development plan. The development plan approved by the city council of Indian Harbour Beach and filed with the city for a planned unit development zone. 
(D)  Final development plan. The development plan approved by the city council of Indian Harbour Beach and recorded with the clerk of the circuit court of Brevard County according to the provisions of this ordinance.

(F)  Final development plan application. The application for approval of the final development plan and for approval of the required exhibits as specified in this ordinance. 
(G)  Developer. Any person, firm, association, syndicate, partnership or corporation, who owns land which is developed into a planned unit development and who is actually involved in the construction and creation of a planned unit development. 
(H)  Stage. A specified portion of the planned unit development that may be developed as an independent entity that is delineated in the preliminary development plan, and the final development plan, and specified within the development schedule. 
(I)  Site. The actual physical area to be developed as a planned unit development, including the natural and created characteristics of said area. 
(J)  Development schedule. A comprehensive statement showing the type and extent of development to be completed within the various practicable time limits and the order in which development is to be undertaken. A development schedule shall contain an exact description of the specific buildings, facilities, common open space, and other improvements to be developed at the end of each time period. 
[II.]  Purpose and intent. The planned unit development is a concept which encourages and permits variation in residential developments by allowing deviation in lot size, bulk or type of dwellings, density, lot coverage, and open space from that required in any one residential land use classification under the zoning regulations of the City of Indian Harbour Beach. The purpose of a planned unit development is to encourage the development of planned residential neighborhoods and communities that provide a full range of residence types as well as commercial uses designed to serve the inhabitants of the planned unit development. It is recognized that only through ingenuity, imagination and flexibility can residential developments be produced which are in keeping with the intent of this section while departing from the strict application of conventional use and dimension requirements of other zoning districts and subdivision regulations. 
    This section is intended to establish procedures and standards of planned unit developments within the incorporated areas of Indian Harbour Beach in order that the following objectives may be attained: 
(A)  Accumulation of large areas of usable open spaces for recreation and preservation of natural amenities. 
(B)  Flexibility in design to take the greatest advantage of natural land, trees, historical, and other features. 
(C)  Creation of a variety of housing types and compatible neighborhood arrangements that give the home buyer greater choice in selecting types of environment and living units. 
(D)  Allowance of sufficient freedom for the developer to take a creative approach to the use of land and related physical development, as well as utilizing innovative techniques to enhance the visual character of the City of Indian Harbour Beach. 
(E)  Efficient use of land which may result in smaller street and utility networks and reduce development costs. 
(F)  Establishment of criteria for the inclusion of compatible associated uses to complement the residential areas within the planned unit development. 
(G)  Simplification of the procedure for obtaining approval of proposed developments through simultaneous review by the city of proposed land use, site consideration, lot and setback considerations, public needs and requirements, and health and safety factors. 
(H)  Economical and efficient use of land, utilities and streets with resulting lower housing costs. 
[III.]  Permitted uses. Uses permitted in the planned unit development may include and shall be limited to the following: 
(A)  Primary residential uses. Single-family detached and multi-family residential dwelling units (including apartments) in semidetached, attached, and multistoried structures. 
(B)  Nonresidential uses. Nonresidential uses of a religious, public or semipublic, cultural, recreational or commercial character and personal service centers, offices and professional centers providing services to residents of the planned unit development. Said nonresidential uses shall be compatible with and secondary to the primary residential use. No building devoted primarily to a commercial use shall be built or established prior to the primary residential buildings or uses it is designed or intended to serve. 
[IV.]  Unified ownership or control. The title of all land within a proposed site for a planned unit development shall be owned or controlled by the developer submitting the applications provided for by this section. The term "controlled by" shall be interpreted to mean that said developer shall have the written consent of all fee owners and all others having any legal or equitable interest in the property within the proposed site not wholly owned by the developer. Said consent shall contain a statement that said developer is authorized to represent said owners and all others having any interest in the submission of an application under the provisions of this section and that said owners shall agree to be bound by the decision of the city council in the event said application is approved. 
[V.]  Common open space. All common open space shall be preserved for its intended purpose as expressed in the final development plan. The developer shall choose one of the following three (3) methods of administering common open space: 
(A)  Public dedication to the city of the common open space. This method is subject to formal acceptance by the city in the sole discretion of the city council, and the city council shall have the right to refuse such dedication in any planned unit development. 
(B)  Establishment of an association or nonprofit corporation of all individuals or corporations owning property within the planned unit development to ensure the maintenance of all common open space. 
(C)  Retention of ownership, control and maintenance of all common open space by the developer. 
    All privately owned common open space shall continue to conform to its intended use and remain as expressed in the final development plan through the inclusion in all deeds of appropriate restrictions to ensure that the common open space is permanently preserved according to the final development plan. Said deed restrictions shall run with the land and shall be for the benefit of present property owners, future property owners and the city. Such deed restrictions shall also contain a prohibition against partition. 
    All common open space as well as public and recreational facilities shall be specifically included in the development schedule and shall be constructed and fully improved by the developer at a rate such that the percentage of such facilities completed at any time shall always equal or exceed the percentage of dwelling units completed at that time. 
    If the developer elects to administer common open space through an association or nonprofit corporation, said organization shall conform to the following requirements: 
(1)  The developer must establish the association or nonprofit corporation prior to the sale of any real property. 
(2)  Membership in the association or nonprofit corporation shall be mandatory for all residential property owners within the planned unit development and said association or corporation shall not discriminate among its members or shareholders. 
(3)  The association or nonprofit corporation shall manage all common open space and recreational and cultural facilities that are not dedicated to the public; shall provide for the maintenance, administration and operation of said land and any other land within the planned unit development not publicly or privately owned; and shall secure adequate liability insurance on the land. 
(4)  If the developer elects an association or nonprofit corporation as a method of administering common open space, the title or deed received by all residential property owners shall include an undivided fee simple estate in all common open space or an unrestricted easement for the use and enjoyment of the common open space.

In granting any conditional land use, the city council shall prescribe any reasonable conditions that it deems necessary to, or desirable for, the public interest. A conditional land use shall not be permitted by the city council unless and until: 
(A)  A written application for such conditional land use is submitted in duplicate, giving the lot, block and addition, or other legal description of the lands desired for such conditional use; the names and addresses of all the owners of said land, the conditional land use desired and the reason for requesting the conditional land use, and shall contain a preliminary site plan per Chapter 104 of the city's Land Development Regulations.

    The applicant shall, in addition to all other requirements, submit a site plan meeting the requirements of Chapter 104 of the city's Land Development Regulations, with any application for a conditional land use. If the application is granted, the construction or development of the property in question shall conform to the site plan submitted and approved with the said application. Any significant changes to the site plan or any variations or modifications to the development or construction shall be approved by the planning and zoning board and city council using the procedure set forth above for initial approval of a conditional land use.

Sec. 2. - Variances. 
(A)  As set forth in article XVI, section 2, of the Charter of the City of Indian Harbour Beach, the zoning board of appeals has the power to authorize a variance from the terms of this section, where, as a result of special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this section will result in unnecessary hardship. For purposes of this section, a variance shall be authorized and granted by the zoning board of appeals only for height, area, size of structure, size of yards, and size of open spaces. 
    A variance shall be granted only if the zoning board of appeals finds in favor of the applicant that all of the following requirements are met: 
(1)  The request is based on a hardship which is unique to the land, building or structure in question, is not applicable to other lands, buildings or structures in the same zoning district, and is not a hardship of a personal nature unrelated to the land, except that a variance request based on handicapped accessibility to land or within a primary structure shall not be deemed a hardship of a personal nature. 
(2)  The need for the variance is not created by the action of the applicant himself. 
(3)  The requested variance will not allow the establishment or expansion of a use which is otherwise prohibited by this section. 
(4)  The request is not based primarily on financial benefit to the applicant. 
(5)  The variance applied for is the minimum necessary to relieve the hardship alleged by the applicant. 
(B)  A variance shall be requested by making written application to the building official. The application shall provide full information and documentation showing the nature of the hardship which creates the need for the variance, the cause or origin of such hardship, the reasons why the variance is sought, all dimensions and other data necessary to show that the variance being requested is the minimum variance which will relieve the alleged hardship, and any other information relevant to the requirements set forth in subsection (A) of this section. 
(C)  All proposed variances shall be submitted to the planning and zoning board for study, and written recommendation prior to consideration of that variance by the zoning board of appeals. As part of its written recommendation, the planning and zoning board shall make specific findings of fact as to whether the application meets each of the requirements set forth in subsection (A) of this section. 
(D)  Upon receipt of the recommendation of the planning and zoning board, the zoning board of appeals shall set a date for a public hearing at which all parties in interest shall have an opportunity to be heard. The city clerk shall cause notice of such public hearing to be published one (1) time in a newspaper of general circulation in Brevard County, Florida, at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date of such hearing, and a copy of the notice of hearing shall be posted both on the property for which a variance is sought and at City Hall. All such notices shall state in substance the variance requested, the reason for such request and a legal description of the property. A copy of said notice shall also be sent by certified mail to the applicant for the variance in question. 
Any party in interest may appear in person or be represented by an agent or by an attorney at the public hearing. 
The zoning board of appeals shall consider the recommendation of the planning and zoning board as part of the official record when hearing an application for any variance. Based on the record and the information presented at the public hearing, the zoning board of appeals shall make findings as to whether the application meets each of the requirements set forth in paragraph (A) of this section. An application for a variance shall be denied if the zoning board of appeals finds that the application does not meet each and every one of the criteria. 
(E)  In granting any variance, the zoning board of appeals may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards with which the applicants shall comply. Violations of such conditions or safeguards when made a part of the terms under which a variance is granted shall be deemed a violation of this ordinance and punishable as provided by this ordinance. Any variance granted by the zoning board of appeals for non-residential real property shall expire and shall be null and void if the construction contemplated by the final site plan is not commenced within one (1) year after the date of approval of the final site plan associated with the variance by the city. Site plan and associated variance extensions may be granted in accordance with section 104-7 of the Land Development Regulations of the city. 
    Any variance granted by the zoning board of appeals for handicapped accessibility under subsection (A) shall expire and shall be null and void if construction contemplated by such variance is not commenced within six (6) months from the date of approval of the variance. Furthermore, if the property for which a handicapped variance has been granted is transferred within six (6) months from the date of approval of such variance and construction contemplated by such variance has not commenced then such variance shall expire and be null and void. 
(F)  Under no circumstances shall the zoning board of appeals grant a variance which would permit or allow a use which is not generally permitted or permitted by conditional land use in the zoning district in question or which increases the maximum lot coverage, building length, building height, or living area beyond that permitted in the applicable zoning district or reduces minimum parking requirements, building separations in multifamily zones, minimum living/floor area, or minimum lot dimensions required in the applicable zoning district. 
(G)  As set forth in article XVI, section 2(c) of the Charter of the City of Indian Harbour Beach, the affirmative vote of four (4) members of the zoning board of appeals shall be necessary in order for the board to decide in favor of the applicant on application for a variance.

Such special exceptions shall be expressly limited to those uses expressly designated as special exceptions within each zoning district as set forth in article XII of this ordinance. 
    All requirements set forth in article XIV of this ordinance for a conditional land use shall apply to the application for and the granting of a special exception by the zoning board of appeals, including, but not limited to, the applicant's burden of proof. In the interpretation of the requirements of the said article XIV, when the same are to be applied to an application for special exception, the term "city council" as it appears in the said article XIV shall be construed to mean "zoning board of appeals" for purposes of this section. 
    As set forth in article XVI, section 2(c) of the Charter of the City of Indian Harbour Beach, the affirmative vote of four (4) members of the zoning board of appeals shall be necessary in order for the board to decide in favor of the applicant on any application for special exception.

At least fifteen (15) days notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the Indian Harbour Beach area in advance of the hearing date, and a copy of said notice shall be posted on the property for which a zoning change is sought and at city hall. 
(3)  When the proposed change or amendment pertains to the rezoning of land, a courtesy notice shall be mailed to the property owners of record within a radius of five hundred (500) feet; provided however, that failure to mail or receive such courtesy notice shall not affect any action or proceeding taken hereunder. The notice shall state the general nature of the proposed amendments as well as the text. 
    The applicant requesting any change of zoning for which a courtesy notice is required to be mailed by the city shall, with his application for such rezoning, submit to the city a list of the names and addresses of all property owners to whom such courtesy notice is to be mailed. Such list shall be compiled from the real property tax rolls of Brevard County, Florida. Any failure in mailing or receiving such courtesy notice shall not affect any action or proceedings with respect to the rezoning or other amendment under consideration. 
(4)  When any proposed change of a zoning district boundary lies within five hundred (500) feet of an adjoining incorporated or unincorporated area, notice shall be forwarded to the planning board or governing body of such adjoining incorporated or unincorporated areas in order to give such body an opportunity to appear at the hearing and express its opinion on the effect of said district boundary change. 
(5)  The planning and zoning board, after conducting the public hearing as hereinabove provided, shall submit the request for amendment or change to this ordinance to the city council together with its written recommendations for approval or denial based on findings made at the public hearing.

ARTICLE III. - DETERMINATION AND OFFSETTING OF IMPACT ON PUBLIC SERVICES AND FACILITIES OF INDIAN HARBOUR BEACH 

Sec. 101-21. - Procedure. 
    During the review of an application for a development order, a determination will be made by the city according to policies set out in the comprehensive plan, the zoning ordinance and this code as to the environmental, physical and fiscal impact of the development on the public services and facilities in the city and the measures necessary to offset said impacts. 
(1)  The determination of impact will use the best available information and will be based upon the maximum impact of the proposed development as generated from the submitted application for a development order. The applicant is encouraged to provide any information in addition to required submittals that will assist in more accurately determining impact. 
(2)  The measures necessary to offset the impact of the proposed development shall be determined by the city during review of an application. The impact of the proposed development will be determined by comparing the desired or determined pre-development standards for levels of services and capacities of the city public service categories as set out in this chapter against the determined post-development levels of those same city public services. 
(3)  Where standards indicating adequate levels of services and capacities are not specifically set out in this code or the comprehensive plan of the city, a determination will be made by the city of the pre-development levels of services and capacities in those categories. That determination shall then become the standard against which the proposed development's impact will be compared. 
Sec. 101-22. - Adequacy of thoroughfare system. 
    The following standard shall apply to the thoroughfare system. The thoroughfare system shall have capacity to serve the proposed development at level of service "E" as defined in the most current version of the Highway Capacity Manual, published by the Transportation Research Board. 
(1)  In considering whether the thoroughfare system has such capacity only that portion of the network located within two (2) miles of the perimeter of the applicant's property shall be considered. 
(2)  The capacity of the thoroughfare system shall be determined based upon sound standards and principles of traffic engineering, considering, to the extent available: 
(a)  Existing transportation studies; 
(b)  Adopted traffic circulation elements of any existing county or city comprehensive plans; 
(c)  Specific vehicle capacities of the thoroughfare system; 
(d)  The demographic nature of the proposed development; and 
(e)  Any other information that may be relevant. 
(3)  In determining the capacity of the thoroughfare system, it shall be assumed that all projects funded for construction under the city's annually adopted capital improvements program, as well as those system improvements committed and evidenced by contract by county, state, and federal agencies in their annual budgets, have been completed and are a part of such system. 
(4)  If it is found that the thoroughfare system lacks capacity to accommodate the additional traffic generated by the proposed development at level of service "E," it shall be determined whether such capacity will be available if all of the transportation improvements contained in the comprehensive plan are completed. If it is determined that such capacity will be available, then the specific improvements necessary to enable the system to reach such capacity shall be identified (hereinafter referred to as "necessary improvements") and the application shall be granted with an express condition regarding the adequacy of the thoroughfare system. At the sole discretion of the city council, such condition shall require one (1) of the following: 
(a)  That the applicant shall construct the share of the necessary improvements proportional to the share of the additional capacity created by such improvements that is needed to accommodate traffic generated by the applicant's development. In the interim, construction shall be proportional to a share of the total capacity. 
(b)  That the applicant's development be phased so that each phase of the development is not occupied until the scheduled completion of necessary improvements to the thoroughfare system needed to accommodate the traffic generated by that phase. If no such necessary improvements are scheduled, then the city council, in cooperation with other appropriate agencies, shall establish a schedule that provides for the completion of the improvements as soon as availability of resources will allow. 
Sec. 101-23. - Adequacy of the park system. 
    The standards contained in subsection 101-23(1)(a) of this code shall be used to determine the impact of the proposed development on the city's park system as described in the comprehensive plan. Only residential development shall be required to provide for the park needs of the future residents of the proposed development. 
(1)  In order to provide lands to be used or provide additional parks necessary to meet the need created by the proposed residential development, a developer must provide for such needs according to one (1) of the following methods as determined by the city council: 
(a)  Dedicate land of suitable size, dimension, topography and general character to serve as parks or a portion thereof, which will meet those needs created by the development. The total amount of land to be dedicated either on or off the development site must equal a ratio of at least four and one-half (4.5) acres of land for every one thousand (1,000) potential residents estimated to occupy the development. The average number of residents that occupy a dwelling in Indian Harbour Beach shall be based upon the latest available data from the U.S. Census Bureau or the University of Florida, Bureau of Economic and Business Research. 
(b)  Deposit in a non-lapsing trust fund, established and maintained by the city, an amount of money at least equal to the value of such amount of land as would have been required to be dedicated by subsection 101-23(1)(a). The amount of such deposit shall be established by the city council at the time of issuance of the development order of the development in question. This deposit amount shall be adjusted annually on October 1, based upon the average percentage change in the property appraiser's assessed valuation of vacant lands in Indian Harbour Beach for the current tax year. 
(2)  When the dedication requirements set forth in subsection 101-23(1)(a) would require the dedication of more than six (6) percent of the gross residential area of the development, then the city shall grant a credit against the excess over six (6) percent of that area which is to be privately owned and maintained for the benefit of the future residents of the development and which will serve their park needs. Such areas may include golf courses, lakes and waterways, private parks and recreational facilities and private open space areas other than the areas necessary to meet front, rear and side yard requirements, and other similar areas specifically required by the applicable land development regulation. Ownership and maintenance of such areas to be credited must be secured by appropriate documents in a form acceptable to the city. 
(3)  Monies deposited by a developer pursuant to subsection 101-23(1)(b) shall be expended within a reasonable period of time for the sole purpose of acquiring and developing land necessary to meet the need for parks created by new development. Monies deposited by a developer pursuant to this section shall not be expended to acquire or develop land for park purposes farther than two (2) miles from the perimeter of the development. 
Sec. 101-24. - Adequacy of the stormwater management system. 
    The proposed development shall be designed to provide for the construction and maintenance of a stormwater management system, which adequately conforms to the applicable standards of the city and of any other governmental agency having jurisdiction over stormwater management in the area of the development.

Potable water service shall be available or provisions will be made to make it available prior to the granting of a development order for the proposed development. 
(2)  A finding that potable water service is available must be based upon a demonstration that the existing water treatment facility has sufficient capacity to provide for the potable water needs of the proposed development and for all other developments in the service area which are occupied, available for occupancy, for which building permits are in effect or for which potable water treatment capacity has been reserved. If potable water service is not available, any development order shall be conditioned on such availability. A finding that potable water service will be made available must be based upon a demonstration that there is a feasible plan to construct or expand a water treatment system which will have sufficient capacity to provide for the potable water needs of the proposed development and for all other developments in the service area, which are occupied, available for occupancy, for which building permits are in effect or for which potable water treatment capacity has been reserved. 
Sec. 101-26. - Adequacy of wastewater collection, treatment and disposal system. 
(1)  Wastewater collection, treatment and disposal services shall be available to the proposed development prior to occupancy. The proposed development shall be designed to provide adequate areas and easements for the installation and maintenance of a wastewater collection, treatment and disposal system which will meet the requirements of the water and sewer element of the comprehensive plan, this code, Chapter 17-6 and Chapter 10D-6, Florida Administrative Code, the most current ANSI/ASTM Standards, and be designed to coordinate with the appropriate 201 Wastewater Facilities Plan approved by DER. 
(2)  A finding that wastewater collection, treatment and disposal services is available must be based upon a demonstration that the existing facilities have sufficient capacity to provide for the needs of the proposed development and for all other developments in the service area which are occupied, available for occupancy, for which building permits are in effect or for which wastewater treatment or disposal capacity has been reserved. If existing wastewater services are unavailable, but will be made available, any development order shall be conditioned upon such availability. A finding that wastewater services will be made available must be based upon a demonstration that there is a feasible plan to construct or expand a wastewater system which will have sufficient capacity to provide for the collection, treatment and disposal needs of the proposed development and for all other developments in the service area which are occupied, available for occupancy, for which building permits are in effect or for which wastewater collection, treatment or disposal capacity has been reserved. The granting of a development order shall not be construed to effect a reservation of wastewater capacity. 
Sec. 101-27. - Adequacy of hazardous waste disposal systems. 
    The hazardous waste disposal systems shall be adequately maintained at existing levels of service for the proposed development. Standards for existing levels of service shall be developed pursuant to subsection 101-21(3).

CHAPTER 102. - CONCURRENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 

Sec. 102-1. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to set forth a system by which it can be determined if sufficient public facilities are available for proposed development prior to issuance of a development permit. 
Sec. 102-2. - Concurrency requirements. 
(1)  For purposes of this section, the collective term "development permit" shall have the same meaning as provided for in section 100. 
(2)  The applicant for a development permit shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city and shall obtain verification that sufficient public facilities and services which meet or exceed the standards and levels of service established in the city's comprehensive plan either are available when needed for the development contemplated by the development permit or will, as a condition of the permit, be available to serve the proposed development. The approval of a site plan in accordance with the procedures and provisions of this ordinance and approval of a subdivision plat in accordance with the procedures and provisions of this ordinance shall be deemed to be preliminary or initial approval only, and no site plan or subdivision plat shall be deemed to have received final approval of the city until the following documents have been submitted to the city with respect to such site plan: 
(a)  A stormwater discharge permit from the St. Johns River Water Management District, Brevard County, or Florida Department of Transportation, whichever agency is the appropriate permitting authority. The stormwater discharge permit shall include a certificate from the permitting authority that the stormwater system into which the proposed project will discharge stormwater runoff has sufficient capacity to accommodate the project. 
(b)  A certificate from Brevard County indicating sufficient sewer capacity for the project. 
(c)  A certificate from Brevard County indicating sufficient solid waste capacity for the project in the Brevard County Landfill. 
(d)  A certificate from the City of Melbourne indicating sufficient potable water capacity for the project in the Melbourne water system. 
(e)  For those projects proposing access to a road or highway under the jurisdiction of Brevard County or the Florida Department of Transportation, a driveway, curb-cut or other access permit shall be required from the appropriate agency. Such permit shall indicate the existing level of service from the access road serving the project, the latest average daily traffic count on such road, the average daily trip generation projections for the project, and the resulting level of service on the access road after taking into account such trip generation data. 
(f)  A certificate from the city's recreation director indicating that sufficient recreational facilities exist in the vicinity of the project to meet the needs of the occupants of the project. 
(g)  For projects equal to one (1) acre or larger, provide proof of the approved Florida Department of Environmental Protection Construction Generic Permit or letter of exemption. 
(h)  The developer must maintain on site an erosion and sedimentation control plan and a stormwater pollution prevention plan. This plan shall provide containment for construction site materials, waste and litter that may be exposed to wind or rain during construction. 
(i)  For all non-exempt residential development, a school capacity availability determination letter (SCADL) shall be required from the Brevard County School Board determining compliance with school capacity or offering a ninety-day negotiation period for mitigation. Exempt residential development is defined in the city's public school facilities element. 
    Notwithstanding the foregoing requirements for submission of documentation and final approval by the city, the time limits applicable to expiration of approvals for site plans and subdivision plats set forth in this code shall be measured from the date of initial approval by the city, and not from the date of final approval contemplated in this section. 
    The documentation described in subsections (a) through (i) of this section shall also be required as a condition precedent to the issuance of any building permit, special exception or variance; provided, however, that a building permit on property which has received final approval of a site plan or a subdivision plat may be issued on the basis of the documentation submitted incident to the final approval of such site plan or subdivision plat. 
(3)  No development permit shall be issued by the city if the development or construction contemplated by such development permit results in a reduction of a level of services for the affected public facilities below the level of services provided and established in the city's comprehensive plan. 
(4)  Nothing in this section shall apply to building permits for construction which has no impact on public facilities or services, including, but not limited to, permits for fences, accessory buildings, enlargement of single-family residences, repairs to structures, driveways, signs, and the like. 
(5)  The applicant for a development permit shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city and shall obtain verification that it has met the standards and level of service for any other mandatory concurrency requirements established by the city of the Florida Legislature from time to time. 
CHAPTER 103. - SUBDIVISION PLAT APPROVAL PROCEDURES 

Sec. 103-1. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to establish the formal requirements and procedures for the subdivision of land within the city.

(3)  Earth work, including slopes and drainage structures, shall have been substantially completed before the construction of the surface course or pavement has begun. 
(4)  All debris from the clearing operation shall be hauled to a landfill or disposed of in a proper manner. Under no circumstances shall the debris from the clearing operation be permitted for fill, buried, or left on site. All debris shall be hauled from the site within seven (7) days of completion of clearing and grubbing operation. 
Sec. 109-12. - Subbase. 
(1)  Subbase material for street construction shall be of acceptable quality as determined by the city and shall be free of large rocks, wood, roots, and other unsuitable substance. 
(2)  Subbases shall be compacted at a density not less than ninety-eight (98) percent as determined by the AASHTO T-180 testing methods requirements. As an exception, for any other areas to be grassed, the required compaction shall be 95 percent of maximum density. 
(3)  Subbases shall be graded to a minimum depth of eight (8) inches after compaction and shall have, at a minimum, a limerock bearing ratio of forty (40) using the state department of transportation method of testing. Both the limerock bearing ratio and compaction requirements shall be within roadways and under curb and gutter. 
(4)  Prior to base course operations, the subbase shall be tested every one thousand (1,000) feet along the curbline of each side of the street and every five hundred (500) feet within the roadway. The test results shall be furnished to the city. All work continued by the developer prior to test results being furnished to the city shall be at the developer's risk, and such work may be subject to a stop work order issued by the city. 
Sec. 109-13. - Base course. 
(1)  Base course material shall be of Florida limerock conforming to the state department of transportation Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, referred to as the "state department of transportation blue book." As an alternative to limerock, and cemented coquina shell bases conforming the state department of transportation blue book may be permitted on a case-by-case basis. The alternative base material may be allowed only after justification and written approval by the city. 
(2)  Base material shall be obtained from mine or quarry approved by the state department of transportation. A copy of the state department of transportation certification papers shall be submitted to the city prior to construction. 
a)  All base material shall have a minimum thickness of eight (8) inches. As soon as proper conditions of moisture are attained, the base material shall be compacted to an average density of at least ninety-eight (98) percent of the maximum obtainable as determined by AASHTO T-180 testing method requirements. The base course material shall have a limerock bearing ratio conducted per source of material and shall have a minimum limerock ratio of one hundred (100). To ensure a uniform crown, a roadway template may be required by the city. 
b)  Compaction tests shall be conducted every five hundred (500) feet of roadway. The city shall not accept any work if asphalt operations begin prior to examination of the test results by the city. All work continued by the developer prior to test results being furnished to the city shall be at the developers risk, and such work may be subject to a stop work order issued by the city. 
Sec. 109-14. - Surface course. 
(1)  Except for streets located within parking areas of multifamily developments, the surface course material for all streets constructed within the city shall be asphalt, and concrete shall be prohibited. Streets located within parking areas of multifamily developments may be permitted to be concrete when city utilities are not affected or if a developer's agreement which provides for the maintenance of city utilities under concrete is executed by the city and the developer. 
(2)  Asphalt operations, including prime coat and tack coat, shall use materials specified in the state department of transportation blue book. All streets shall be of type III asphalt, with a minimum thickness of one and one-half (11/2) inches and compaction no less than ninety-six (96) percent maximum density. No deviations shall be permitted on the depth requirement. Alternative types of asphalt may be permitted on a case-by-case basis, but must be requested and approved in writing prior to the beginning of the asphalt operation. 
a)  The asphalt shall be cored every two hundred (200) feet, and the core holes shall be filled with concrete upon completion of the test. 
b)  A professional engineer registered and licensed in the state shall conduct a test on the asphalt. The city shall not approve or accept a street with less than the minimum thickness and density requirements or a street in which test results are unsatisfactory to the city. 
Sec. 109-15. - Protection of pavement. 
    After completion of the surface course of a street, no vehicular traffic of any kind shall be permitted on the pavement until it has set sufficiently, and in no case less than twenty-four (24) hours after completion, unless otherwise authorized by the city. 
Sec. 109-16. - Curb and gutter. 
(1)  Curb and gutter shall be provided for all streets and shall be of Portland cement concrete with a minimum structural strength of three thousand (3,000) pounds per square inch. Concrete shall conform to the standards set forth in the state department of transportation blue book. 
(2)  Type E or type F curb and gutter shall be required with construction in accordance with index no. 300 of the state department of transportation roadway and traffic design standards. Miami curb may be acceptable but shall be limited to local streets within residential subdivisions. 
(3)  Curb and gutter shall be sampled and tested for strength every fifty (50) cubic yards. The test results shall be furnished to the city. 
Sec. 109-17. - Restoration. 
(1)  Following the completion of street construction, the area from back of curb to the right-of-way line shall be graded flat. 
(2)  To prevent erosion and to control sediment, a two-foot-wide strip of sod shall be placed adjacent to curbing and around all inlets and outfall structures. The sod shall be adequately maintained by the developer until the roots are established. Failure of the establishment of the roots shall result in the replacement of the sod by the developer. 
(3)  The remaining area to the right-of-way line shall be planted with seed and mulch or hydroseed. Failure of the seed to sprout within seven (7) days of planting shall result in the area being reseeded by the developer. Sod may be required on a case-by-case basis as determined by the city.
