PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Hartselle, Alabama. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1966 Code, as supplemented through July 24, 1995, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1966 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    This 2010 republication includes all amendatory legislation considered for inclusion through Ord. No. 1334, adopted January 12, 2010, and was accomplished under the supervision of Diana Ossi, Editor. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. A table listing state law citations within the text and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Code Attorney, and John Welch, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Betty P. Parker, City Clerk/Treasurer, and Mr. Larry Madison, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Any person whose notices are returned undeliverable three times may be removed from the registry. All such persons so removed from the registry shall have the right to reapply for inclusion in the same. 
(g)  Misuse of e-mail notification by a person in any manner shall result in removal of such person from the registry and shall constitute grounds to prevent such person from receiving direct notice thereafter unless such person is allowed to be placed back on the registry by the council for good cause shown.

Sec. 3-1. - Short title. 
    This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Hartselle Alcoholic Beverage Ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 1454, § 1, 11-29-2016) 
Sec. 3-2. - Purpose. 
(1)  This chapter is enacted for the purposes, among others, of promoting the health and general welfare of the community, of establishing reasonable standards for the regulation and control of the licensing and sales of alcoholic beverages, and of protecting and preserving certain areas, through reasonable consideration, among others, to the character of the areas and their peculiar suitability for particular uses, to the congestion in the roads and streets, to a general view of promoting desirable living conditions and sustaining stability of neighborhoods and property values, and to the prevention of undesirable persons from engaging in or having any interest in the sale, distribution or possession of alcoholic beverages. This chapter shall be construed as an exercise by the city of the police power of the state delegated to the city in the regulation of traffic in alcoholic beverages within the city as provided by state law. 
(2)  The Hartselle City Council intends to prohibit or restrict to the extent legally possible under Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board regulations and applicable state statutes the licensing of establishments commonly referred to as bars or night clubs or other establishments whose primary source of revenue is sale of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises of such establishments. The council has made provisions for bars and lounge areas within restaurants and for other licensing for on-premises consumption of alcoholic beverages which it believes adequately and reasonably permits such sales and business while maintaining the character of the city as it has existed to date to the fullest possible extent with legalized alcohol sales. The council deems this a legitimate exercise of its police powers in keeping with the overwhelming will of the people of the city and in promotion of their safety and general well-being, as well as preservation of property values and the character of the community. This chapter should be construed in keeping with that intent.

    If an animal control officer or a law enforcement officer has investigated and determined that there exists probable cause to believe that an animal is potentially dangerous or vicious, the chief officer of the animal shelter or animal control officer or his or her immediate supervisor or the head of the local law enforcement agency, or his or her designee, shall petition the municipal court of the City of Hartselle for a hearing for the purpose of determining whether or not the animal in question should be declared potentially dangerous or vicious. Whenever possible, any complaint received from a member of the public which serves as the evidentiary basis for the animal control officer or law enforcement officer to find probable cause shall be sworn to and verified by the complainant and shall be attached to the petition. The municipal judge shall make such determination after a hearing, written notice of which shall be given to the complainant and to the owner of the animal, where the owner's address can be reasonably ascertained by the municipal court. The owner or keeper of the animal shall be served with notice of the hearing and a copy of the petition, either personally or by first-class mail with return receipt requested. The hearing shall be held no less than ten days nor more than 30 days after such notice is mailed to the owner or keeper of the animal and shall be open to the public. At such hearing all interested persons shall have the opportunity to present evidence on the issue of the animal's dangerousness. The court may admit all relevant evidence, including incident reports and the affidavits of witnesses, limit the scope of discovery, and may shorten the time to produce records or witnesses. In the event that the animal in question has caused severe injury to any person, the municipal judge may impound the animal, at the owner's expense, pending the hearing and determination of the complaint. If the court finds that the animal is potentially dangerous or vicious, it may make any orders authorized by this chapter or other laws, including but not limited to assessment of fines, costs and imprisonment against the owner or keeper as provided in section 1-7 of this Code. 
(Ord. No. 1077, § 1, 10-24-2000) 
Sec. 10-166. - Notice, hearing, and appeal. 
(a)  After the hearing conducted pursuant to section 10-165, the owner or keeper of the animal shall be notified in writing of the determination and orders issued, either personally or by first-class mail postage prepaid by the municipal court. If a determination is made that the animal is potentially dangerous or vicious and no appeal is filed, the owner or keeper shall comply with the municipal court's order no later than 14 days following the rendering of the decision. If the owner or keeper of the animal contests the determination, he or she may, within 14 days of the municipal court's decision appeal the decision to the circuit court of Morgan County. All filing fees and costs shall be paid by the owner or keeper of the animal. The owner or keeper of the animal shall serve notice upon the City of Hartselle that the appeal has been filed. 
(b)  The circuit court shall conduct a hearing de novo, and make its own determination as to potential danger and viciousness and make other orders authorized by this article, based upon the evidence presented. The court may admit all relevant evidence, including incident reports and the affidavits of witnesses, limit the scope of discovery, and may shorten the time to produce records or witnesses. If the court rules the animal to be potentially dangerous or vicious, compliance with the order shall begin within seven days of the date of the court's determination. 
(c)  The determination of the circuit court shall be final and conclusive upon all parties. However, the animal control authority shall have the right, following due process, to later declare an animal to be vicious or to determine that the animal constitutes a threat to the public health and safety, for any subsequent actions of the animal.

(Ord. No. 1077, § 1, 10-24-2000) 
Sec. 10-168. - When animal may not be declared potentially dangerous or vicious.

No animal may be declared potentially dangerous or vicious if the animal was protecting or defending a person within the immediate vicinity of the animal from an attack or assault. No animal may be declared potentially dangerous or vicious if an injury or damage was sustained by a domestic animal which at the time the injury or damage was sustained was teasing, tormenting, abusing, or assaulting the animal. 
(b)  No dog may be declared potentially dangerous or vicious if the injury or damage to a domestic animal was sustained while the dog was working as a hunting dog, herding dog, or predator control dog on the property of, or under the control of, its owner or keeper, and the damage or injury was to a species or type of domestic animal appropriate to the work of the dog, nor if injury to a human being or domestic animal occurs while the dog is engaged in legitimate law enforcement activity or licensed guard dog service where the injured person is committing a trespass on property protected by the dog while so engaged as a guard dog. 
(c)  No animal may be declared potentially dangerous or vicious if it was responding to pain or injury, or was protecting itself, or while on the owner's premises, protecting its kennels or its offspring.

(b)  Code of Ala. 1975, § 11-51-193, requires the Alabama Department of Revenue to maintain a listing of all State boards and agencies that regulate the licensing of businesses or occupations under their jurisdiction and that so notify the revenue department in writing, collectively called "state licensing boards". Prior to issuing a license to any applicant subject to the jurisdiction of any such state licensing board, the city shall attempt to confirm with the board in question that the applicant is duly licensed or certified by and in good standing with that board.

(b)  If the municipality determines that the amount of business license tax reported on or remitted with any business license remittance form is incorrect, if no business license remittance form is filed within the time prescribed, or if the information provided on the form is insufficient to allow the taxing jurisdiction to determine the proper amount of business license tax due, the municipality shall calculate the correct amount of the tax based on the most accurate and complete information reasonably obtainable and enter a preliminary assessment for the correct amount of business license tax, including any applicable penalty and interest. 
(c)  The municipality shall promptly mail a copy of any preliminary assessment to the taxpayer's last known address by either first class U.S. mail or certified U.S. mail with return receipt requested, or, in the sole discretion of the municipality, deliver the preliminary assessment to the taxpayer by personal delivery.

(2)  If a petition for review is not timely filed, or is timely filed, and upon further review the license officer determines that the preliminary assessment is due to be upheld in whole or in part, the municipality may make the assessment final in the amount of business license tax due as computed by the license officer, with applicable interest and penalty computed to the date of entry of the final assessment. The license officer shall, whenever practicable, complete his or her review of the taxpayer's petition for review and applicable law within 90 days following the later of the date of filing of the petition or the conference, if any. 
(3)  A copy of the final assessment shall promptly be mailed to the taxpayer's last known address (i) by either first class U.S. mail or certified U.S. mail with return receipt requested in the case of assessments of business license tax of $500.00 or less, or (ii) by certified U.S. mail with return receipt requested in the case of assessments of business license tax of more then $500.00. In either case, at the option of the taxing jurisdiction a copy of the final assessment may be delivered to the taxpayer by personal delivery. The final assessment shall include a statement informing the taxpayer of his or her right to appeal the final assessment to circuit court within 30 days from the date of the entry of the final assessment.

(a)  In lieu of any other type of license, a taxpayer may at its option purchase for $100.00 plus an issuance fee not to exceed $10.00, a delivery license for the privilege of delivering its merchandise in the municipality if the taxpayer meets all of the following criteria:

(4)  The gross receipts derived from the sale and any requisite set-up or installation of all merchandise so delivered shall not exceed $75,000.00 during the license year; 
(5)  Any set-up or installation shall relate only to:

(ii)  The merchandise to delivered. 
(6)  If at any time during the current license year the taxpayer fails to meet any of the above stated criteria, then within 45 days after any of said criteria have been violated or exceeded, the taxpayer shall purchase a business delivery license or other appropriate license from the municipality and will be subject to a penalty of $10.00. 
(b)  Mere delivery of the taxpayer's merchandise by common carrier shall not allow the municipality to assess a business license tax against the taxpayer, but the gross receipts derived from any sale and delivery accomplished by means of a common carrier shall be counted against the $75,000.00 limitation described in the preceding section if the taxpayer also during the same license year sells and delivers into municipal limits using a delivery vehicle other than a common carrier. 
(c)  A common carrier, contract carrier, or similar delivery service making deliveries on behalf of others shall not be entitled to purchase a delivery license. 
(d)  The delivery license shall be calculated in arrears, based on the related gross receipts during the preceding license year.

(f)  A taxpayer that otherwise meets the criteria for the purchase of a delivery license is not required to purchase a delivery license or a regular business license if (i) the taxpayer's gross receipts that are derived from within the municipality do not exceed $10,000.00; and (ii) the taxpayer has no other physical presence within the municipality during the year.

(b)  So that its terms will continue to apply fully to all providers of ambulance services other than to the provider selected by the E911 board pursuant to the ambulance arrangement as the provider of emergency services, the ambulance ordinance is not being amended. However, the ambulance ordinance shall continue to apply to the emergency ambulance service provider selected by the E911 board pursuant to the ambulance ordinance except as herein provided. Should the city hereafter withdraw from participation in the ambulance arrangement the provisions of the ambulance ordinance shall be deemed fully applicable to all ambulance service providers as specified in the ambulance ordinance.

ARTICLE II. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 46-21. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of Alabama has in Title 11, Chapter 19, Sections 1-24, Chapter 45, Sections 1-11, Chapter 52, Sections 1-84, and Title 41, Chapter 9, Section 166 of the Code of Alabama, 1975, authorized local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of the city does ordain as follows. 
(Ord. No. 1440, § 1, 3-22-2016) 
Sec. 46-22. - Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of Hartselle, Alabama are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(Ord. No. 1440, § 1, 3-22-2016) 
Sec. 46-23. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
(5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters. 
(Ord. No. 1440, § 1, 3-22-2016) 
Sec. 46-24. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this chapter are: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(3)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of floodprone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
(4)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(5)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(6)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; and 
(7)  To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area. 
(Ord. No. 1440, § 1, 3-22-2016) 
DIVISION 2. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 46-25. - Lands to which this chapter applies.

(Ord. No. 1440, § 1, 3-22-2016) 
Sec. 46-26. - Basis for area of special flood hazard. 
    The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in its flood insurance study (FIS), dated December 16, 2005, with accompanying maps and other supporting data and any revision thereto, are adopted by reference and declared a part of this chapter. For those land areas acquired by the municipality through annexation, the current effective FIS and data for Morgan County, Alabama, are hereby adopted by reference. Areas of special flood hazard may also include those areas known to have flooded historically or defined through standard engineering analysis by governmental agencies or private parties but not yet incorporated in a FIS.

Sec. 46-32. - Penalties for violation. 
    Violation of the provisions of this chapter or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions shall constitute a misdemeanor.

(Ord. No. 1440, § 1, 3-22-2016) 
Sec. 46-67. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard designated as A1-30, AE, AH, A (with estimated BFE), the following provisions are required: 
(1)  New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 46-66(4), "elevated buildings." 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any nonresidential structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 46-66(6). 
(3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
(a)  All manufactured homes placed and substantially improved on: (i) individual lots or parcels, (ii) in new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (iii) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (iv) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 
(b)  Manufactured homes placed and substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
(i)  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation, or 
(ii)  Where no base flood elevation exists, the manufactured home chassis and supporting equipment is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength and is elevated to a maximum of 60 inches (five feet) above grade. 
(c)  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Refer: Section 46-66(6).) 
(d)  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
(i)  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, fully licensed and ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions; or 
(ii)  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction," including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections (3)(a), and (c), above. 
(4)  Standards for subdivisions. 
(a)  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
(b)  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
(c)  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards, and;

(Ord. No. 1440, § 1, 3-22-2016) 
Sec. 46-68. - Floodways. 
(1)  Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 46-26, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
(a)  The community shall select and adopt a regulatory floodway based on the principle that the area chosen for the regulatory floodway must be designed to carry the waters of the base flood, without increasing the water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point; 
(b)  Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the adopted regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; 
(c)  A community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision, fulfills the requirements for such revisions as established under the provisions of [Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 44] § 65.12, and receives the approval of the administrator. 
(d)  Require, until a regulatory floodway is designated, that no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. 
(e)  Only if subsections (b), (c) or (d), above are satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 4. 
(Ord. No. 1440, § 1, 3-22-2016) 
Sec. 46-69. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations (approximate A-zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 46-26, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (approximate A-zones), the following provisions apply: 
(1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 46-26, then the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of division 4. Only if data are not available from these sources, then the following subsection (2), and (4) shall apply: 
(2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 25 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. [Optional] 
(3)  All development in zone A must meet the requirements of section 46-66 and section 46-67. 
(4)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Also, in the absence of a base flood elevation, a manufactured home must also meet the elevation requirements of subsection 46-67(3)(b)(ii) in that the structure must be elevated to a maximum of 60 inches (5 feet). [Optional] Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 46-66(4) "elevated buildings". 
    The floodplain administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(Ord. No. 1440, § 1, 3-22-2016) 
Sec. 46-70. - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). 
    Areas of special flood hazard established in section 46-26, may include designated "AO" shallow flooding areas. These areas have base flood depths of one to three feet above ground, with no clearly defined channel. The following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential and nonresidential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the flood depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of flood waters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 46-66(4), "elevated buildings". 
The floodplain administrator shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(2)  New construction and the substantial improvement of a nonresidential structure may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be water tight to the specified FIRM flood level or two feet (if no map elevation is listed), above highest adjacent grade, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and as required in subsections 46-42(1)(c), and (2). 
(3)  Drainage paths shall be provided to guide floodwater around and away from any proposed structure. 
(Ord. No. 1440, § 1, 3-22-2016) 
DIVISION 5. - VARIANCE PROCEDURES 

Sec. 46-72. - Variances. 
(1)  The board of zoning adjustment as established by the city council of the city shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter. 
(2)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
(3)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of zoning adjustment may appeal such decision to a court of appropriate jurisdiction as provided for by state law. 
(4)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(5)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this division are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(6)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(7)  In reviewing such requests, the board of zoning adjustment shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
(8)  Conditions for variances: 
(a)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
(i)  A finding of good and sufficient cause, 
(ii)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
(iii)  a determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(b)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of a historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(c)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(d)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs/Office of Water Resources upon request. 
(9)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this chapter, the board of zoning adjustment may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it's before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. [Substantial damage also means flood related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damages occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "repetitive loss" or "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The market value of the building should be the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. 
    For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations.

The chief will then conduct a criminal background investigation and driver's history check on all individuals listed on the application. In addition, the chief will investigate other information supplied by the applicant to determine if applicant meets all requirements for participation in the rotation system. Applicants must furnish any additional information requested by the department's representative during the investigation.

No wrecker service or operator shall be eligible to participate in the dispatch rotation system, and shall not be permitted to do so, unless the service or operator has a permanent business location as defined herein within the Hartselle municipal limits or, if without said municipal limits, within a five-mile radius of the center of the intersection of U.S. Highway 31 and Alabama Highway 36 in the municipal limits. This limitation shall be initially inapplicable where the applicant certifies to the chief in writing that said applicant intends to comply with said requirements within six months of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this article, subject, however, to such compliance within said time, failing which the chief shall remove such service or operator from the rotation list. 
(Ord. No. 1356, § 2, 10-26-2010) 
Sec. 54-54. - Operation. 
    The following conditions shall govern the conduct of operators on the rotation list: 
(1)  Police department dispatch necessary, exception. Except for private requests for consensual wrecker services by the vehicle owner, no operator shall proceed to the scene without being dispatched to do so by the police department nor drive a wrecker to or near the scene of a vehicular accident or disabled vehicle on the streets of the city and park the same unless such wrecker has been authorized to proceed to the scene of the vehicular accident or disabled vehicle by the department or by the owner or operator of the vehicle. No representative, agent or employee of a wrecker operator shall solicit business in any manner for a wrecker operator at the scene of a vehicular accident or disabled vehicle. The unauthorized presence of any wrecker or large wrecker parked on any public street or highway in the city at or near the scene of any accident, collision or disabled vehicle shall be prima facie evidence of a solicitation in violation of this section. 
(2)  Obedience to traffic laws; operator safety. No operator shall speed or violate any other traffic laws or disregard any traffic control devices while answering a call. The provision of wrecker services shall be done in a reasonable and safe manner and no operator shall needlessly congest the scene of a vehicle accident.

Operators shall take due care and exercise due caution at all times when responding to dispatcher or performing services when dispatched to do so. 
(3)  Rotation system participation. Authorization to participate in the rotation system shall be considered a personal grant of a privilege and permission to the operator who made application for the same and shall constitute authorization only to that particular legal entity as it operates a bona fide wrecker service. It shall not be subject to assignment, transfer or lease; neither shall the operator sublet the use of the name under which rotation system participation was requested and neither shall the operator permit the exercise by another in any manner of the rights or privileges granted by authorization for participation in the rotation system. Participation on the rotation log shall not constitute a property interest. Authorization under this article shall be voided if the business address or location of facilities is changed. Further, any change in ownership due to sale, merger, dissolution, death or any other reason shall result in the removal of the business from the rotation list and shall necessitate a new application being filed. 
(4)  Submission of daytime and nighttime telephone numbers. At the time of application, each operator shall furnish the chief with one telephone number to be used for dispatches during the day and one telephone number to be used for dispatches during the night. Any changes in the aforementioned telephone numbers shall be immediately transmitted to the chief. No pagers or answering machines are permitted as call-out numbers.

If an operator is not capable at the time of dispatch to so respond, he/she shall immediately notify the department's communication center of this fact. If the operator provides immediate notice of delay and provides a reasonable time of arrival on-scene, the operator may take up to a total of 30 minutes from the time of dispatch to arrive.

(c)  Whenever heavy equipment or large vehicles are involved in an accident and it is determined by the police officer on-scene that the wrecker next up on the rotation list does not have adequate equipment to handle the accident, then the department reserves the right to call a large wrecker from an operator on the rotation list capable of providing the needed services. If a call is made under these circumstances, the operator being passed over will be repositioned on the rotation list accordingly. Calls for a large wrecker will be rotated among the companies having qualified large wreckers. 
(d)  If the operator does not arrive on-scene within the time requirements established herein or if the public health, safety and welfare necessitate more expeditious action, the police department reserves the right to request the services of the next operator on the rotation list. Under these circumstances, the operator who received the first call will forfeit his/her position on the rotation list for that turn. Any operator who is late in responding to dispatches for wrecker service without justification may be subject to penalties as provided herein. 
(e)  When emergency conditions necessitate, the city reserves the right to request the services of the operator who is best able to handle the situation and/or who can reach the scene most expeditiously, regardless of the operator's position on the rotation list. If a dispatch is made under these circumstances, the operator making such a response will not forfeit his/her respective position on the rotation list.

(2)  A hearing shall be held within 20 days after the filing of a written request for a hearing before the city council. The chief shall notify the operator of the time, date and place of the hearing.

(3)  The city council shall render a decision by resolution within 15 days from the date of such hearing. Such resolution shall set forth the decision of the city council and the reasons for the same. 
(b)  The department will reinstate to the rotation list a suspended operator upon written application after the period of suspension has elapsed and after the department has determined that such operator is in compliance with all regulations of this article. 
(c)  If any violations of the regulations or provisions of this article are deemed by the chief to be of such a nature as to endanger public safety, the chief shall immediately suspend from the rotation list the operator committing such violation, and then provide notice pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a) above. 
(d)  No applications for reinstatement to the rotation list resulting from violation of these regulations will be considered by a transferee of the suspended operator's business interest unless such transfer was the result of a bona fide sale of a majority of the assets of the business for a reasonable consideration.

Sec. 78-43. - Precollection practices. 
(a)  Segregation of wastes. Only garbage shall be placed in garbage containers and only yard waste shall be placed in yard waste containers. To prevent spillage when garbage containers are emptied by the city, all waste placed in garbage containers shall first be bagged and no loose, unbagged waste shall be placed in such containers. It shall be unlawful to place any unauthorized waste in any garbage or yard waste container. Such containers shall be placed for collection at locations designated by the city and will not be emptied by the city if placed otherwise. Yard waste containers shall be filled to capacity before yard waste may be placed in the months of November, December, January and February outside of such containers as provided in this article. All items other than the contents of any garbage or yard waste containers and designated for collection by the city in this section shall be kept separate and apart from other solid waste and placed for pickup as nearly as practicable to, but not on the adjacent public street or roadway and as nearly as practicable to the property line of the parcel of property in question where said line intersects the right-of-way line of the public street or roadway. The various type of wastes referred to in this section shall be kept separated according to kind and not intermingled with other types of waste. No item for collection shall be placed within five feet of any fence, hedge, utility pole, guy wire, utility pedestal, street sign, utility sign or parked vehicle, or any object making access from the street impractical. No item shall be placed so as to obscure any address numbers, utility or water meter, manhole or any item which might reasonably be expected to damage, or impede the efficient use of, collection machinery and equipment. No items shall be placed in such a way as to impede access to any fire hydrant or violate any ordinance of the city or state law respecting obstruction of or access to fire hydrants. No item shall be placed so as to obstruct or impede the flow of storm drainage runoff in gutters, culverts or ditches. In the event the city determines that any item or items has or have been placed for collection in such a way as to make removal by the city potentially unsafe for its employees or overly burdensome on its employees or equipment, the property owner, after reasonable notice, shall relocate the material and place it in such a way as to allow safe removal or make the material more accessible. 
(b)  Leaves and grass clippings. Leaves and grass clippings shall at no time be placed in bags for collection, either within or without any garbage or yard waste container. Leaves in excess of what can be placed in a resident's yard waste container may be placed in loose piles without bagging in the months of November, December, January and February and shall be placed for collection as provided in subsection (a) of this section. Leaves and grass clippings shall not be transported or deposited by any person on or over any other person's property, except with that person's permission. 
(c)  Shrubbery clippings. Shrubbery clippings and other small miscellaneous vegetation, including garden vegetation, shall be placed in the yard waste container. In no case shall the same be placed in bags for collection, within or without any garbage or yard waste container. Such waste too large or in such volumes as not to be suitable for disposal in the yard waste container shall be disposed of by the person or entity responsible for same at the public CD landfill or by private contract. 
(d)  Tree limbs. Tree limbs shall be cut in sections not exceeding five feet in length nor 100 pounds in weight with protruding branches closely trimmed. All limbs shall be placed in neat piles and located as provided in subsection (a) of this section. No limbs shall be placed in any garbage or yard waste container (small twigs and sticks excepted).

(2)  The city will pick up large household appliances and construction materials or debris not produced by a contractor on Wednesday each week. (In instances where a contractor produces same the contractor shall be responsible for removal or the responsible party shall otherwise do so at his expense.) This service shall be available on a call-in basis only and is subject to placement as designated by the city. This service will be performed at a cost to the person requesting the same of $10.00 per load. No person shall place any such item for collection without notifying the city of such placement at least two business days prior to scheduled pick-up. Any person who fails to pay for such service by a date specified by the city shall be denied such service thereafter until the bill is paid and shall be required to prepay for any future service. 
(f)  Volume limits. No pile or placement of any of the materials referred to in this section shall exceed six cubic yards (or the equivalent of what can be fully contained in two standard one-half ton pickup truck beds without sideboards), unless by prior arrangement with the city and where a price to be paid by the owner for removal by the city has been agreed upon. The city shall have the right to refuse to remove larger loads and require the owner to cause the same to be removed himself or by contractor at the owner's expense. 
(g)  Container volume limits. No garbage or yard waste container shall be filled beyond its capacity so that its lid cannot be fully closed prior to collection. Except when waste is being deposited into them, all containers shall have their lids fully closed at all times.

Collection of items enumerated in section 78-43(b) through (e) hereof shall be at such intervals as the mayor may from time to time determine. Collection of wastes in yard waste containers shall also be made by the city on a regular schedule of not less than one time per week for residential collection, except that the mayor may suspend such collection during weeks containing legal holidays. Likewise, residential garbage collection days may be rescheduled in holidays weeks so long as the service is provided during such week. 
(b)  Placement location. No garbage container or yard waste container shall be placed for collection of its contents except at a location specifically designated by the city unless prior approval is obtained from the city for placement at some other location upon a showing of need. The city shall designate such location upon delivery of such containers and this may be accomplished by placing the containers in the authorized pick-up location upon delivery. The customer shall be responsible to insure clear, safe and convenient access to the containers for emptying and shall not allow any object, material or condition to block or interfere unreasonably with such access. Where collections are authorized to be made from some other location, approaches to same shall be maintained in such manner as not to be a hazard to collection personnel or equipment. Failure to comply with these provisions after notification by the city shall cause service to be discontinued until such time as the failure is corrected. At no time will collection personnel enter houses, buildings or fences for the purpose of garbage collection. 
(c)  Placement time. It shall be unlawful to place or permit the placement of garbage or yard waste containers for collection before the day preceding the day designated by the city for collection, or to leave such containers on the placement site after the day designated for collection.

The city shall be divided into quadrants which shall include northeast, southeast, northwest, and southwest. The suffix "northeast," "southeast," "northwest," "southwest," will become a part of the street name. 
(1)  Each building east of the east and west base line and facing a street running in an easterly direction shall carry a number and address indicating its location east of the base line. 
(2)  Each building west of the east and west base line and facing a street running in a westerly direction shall carry a number and address indicating its location west of the base line.

(5)  All buildings on diagonal streets shall be numbered the same as buildings on northerly and southerly streets if the diagonal runs more from the north to the south, and the same rule shall apply on easterly and westerly streets if the diagonal runs more from the east to the west. 
(6)  To ensure uniform numbering to the outlying sections of the city, from time to time there will be established rectifying lines. Rectifying lines are auxiliary base lines and serve the purpose of correcting or rectifying nonconformity with block numbers caused by unequal lengths of blocks. 
(Code 1966, § 14-35) 
Sec. 82-78. - Numbering of streets, lots, houses and buildings. 
    The number of each street shall begin at the base line and increase systemically in increments of 100 on a block-by-block basis. All lots and houses on the south and east side of all streets shall be even numbers, and all lots and houses on the north and west side of all streets shall have odd numbers. All buildings facing streets not extending through to the base line shall be assigned the same relative numbers as if the street did extend to the base line.

(b)  Such numbers shall be placed within 30 days after the assignment of the house number. The cost of each number shall be paid for by the property owner. Each number shall not be less than three inches in height and shall be made of durable and clearly visible material. 
(c)  The numbers shall be conspicuously placed immediately above, on or at the side of the proper door for each dwelling unless practical for visibility purposes to be located elsewhere. However, all numbers must be seen plainly from the road. Whenever any building is situated more than 50 feet from the front property line, the number on such building shall be conspicuously displayed on the owner's property at the property line, near the walkway, driveway or entrance to such building, upon a gatepost, fence, post, mailbox or other appropriate place so as to be easily viewed from the street. 
(Code 1966, § 14-37) 
Sec. 82-80. - City numbering system to be properly recorded and filed. 
    For the purpose of facilitating the correct number, appropriate records of all streets, avenues and public ways within the city showing the proper numbers of all houses and other buildings fronting upon all streets, avenues or public ways shall be kept on file in the office of the building inspector. 
(Code 1966, § 14-38) 
Sec. 82-81. - Duty of building inspector to provide information regarding previously existing and newly assigned numbers. 
    It shall be the duty of the building inspector to inform any party applying for a number of the numbers belonging to or embraced within the limits of any lot or property as provided in this article. In case of conflict as to proper number to be assigned to any building, the building inspector shall determine the number of such building.

Sec. 82-82. - Procurement of official number prerequisite to issuance of building permit.

No building permit shall be issued for any house, building or structure until the owner has procured from the municipal building inspector the official number of the premises. Final approval of any structure erected or repaired, altered or modified shall be withheld until permanent and proper numbers have been affixed to the structure. 
(Code 1966, § 14-40) 
Sec. 82-83. - Moving numbers from one location to another. 
    Numbers shall not be moved from one house to another and shall remain on the structure or location to which assigned unless changed by the authority of the building inspector. 
(Code 1966, § 14-41) 
Sec. 82-84. - Violations. 
    If the owner of any building required to be numbered by this article shall neglect for a period of 30 days to duly attach and maintain the proper number of such building, the city shall serve upon the owner a notice requiring such owner to properly number the building; and if he neglects to do so for ten days after the service of such notice, he shall be deemed to have violated this article.

b.  Where any used part, including tires of an automotive vehicle or a truck trailer, semitrailer or house trailer, is taken in trade, or in a series of trades, as a credit or part payment on the sale of a new or rebuilt part of tire, the tax levied in this article shall be paid on the net difference, that is, the price of the new or used part or tire sold less the credit for the used part or tire taken in trade; however, this provision shall not be construed to include batteries.

(b)  Any person shall be considered a designee of the mayor or chief of police if he or she is given any written authority to designate the speed limit zones established hereby. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that any time any work, maintenance or repair is in progress on any public roadway in the City of Hartselle, Alabama, where a speed limit is indicated in accordance with the provisions of this section that the mayor, chief of police or appropriate designee has authorized the establishment of such speed limit. Furthermore, a general authorization to any one entity authorizing establishment of such speed limits from the chief of police or the mayor shall be deemed to be authority granted to all persons employed by or under contract with such entities. The authority may be granted as a general delegation of such authority to place signs establishing such speed limits as the need arises from time to time where such work, repairs or maintenance take place and need not be specifically granted for each individual work site. By way of example only, written authority from the mayor to the director of a public utility shall be deemed a directive to any employee or contractor of that public utility to place speed limit signs on an as-needed basis. 
(c)  The speed limit in areas designated in accordance with this section shall be at a rate set within the discretion of the mayor, chief of police or his or her designee and shall be in effect when, and only when, indicated by appropriate signage with a clearly visible and legible speed limit clearly communicating that said speed limit is in effect at the particular time in question and within the area in question. Said signs shall be placed in conspicuous locations, clearly visible to passing motorists with sufficient sight distance to allow the motorist to safely slow down when entering the temporary speed limit zone so established by placement of such signs. 
(2)  No person shall operate a motor vehicle in excess of any speed as shall be posted with appropriate signage in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
(3)  Any violation of this section shall be an offense against the City of Hartselle, Alabama, and shall be prosecuted and punished in the same manner as other violations of maximum speed limit ordinances and statutes applicable in the City of Hartselle, Alabama. In the event workers are physically present in any zone hereby established at the time any such violation shall occur, the operator of the motor vehicle violating such ordinance shall be assessed a fine of double the amount prescribed by law outside any such zone. However, this fine shall be applicable only in the event personnel are present and that fact is indicated by appropriate signs, which shall also warn of double fines and that the double fines are only applicable when personnel are present. 
(4)  The mayor or the chief of police may promulgate and implement administrative rules and procedures as it may deem necessary or appropriate to carry out the intention of this section. 
(5)  This section and its subsections shall be cumulative with and in addition to the provisions of Code of Ala. 1975, §§ 32-5-93 and 32-5A-176.1, and as such statutes may be amended or superseded hereafter.

DIVISION 2. - BUILDING SEWERS AND CONNECTIONS 

Sec. 94-96. - Individual connection; regulated. 
(a)  At such time as a sewer becomes available to a property served by a private wastewater disposal system, a direct connection shall be made within 30 days to the public sewer. The sewer shall be considered available where the first floor of the building above or on ground level can be served by the sewer line in accordance with the board's rules and regulations and general practices. Where a sewer is available, it will be presumed that the wastewater from the premises is discharged either directly or indirectly into the sewer; and the property shall be billed for sewerage service. However, if the making of connection is delayed, the property shall be subject to such charges 30 days after the sewer is accepted by the wastewater control system. Any septic tanks, cesspools and similar private wastewater disposal facilities shall be abandoned. 
(b)  Connection shall be made to the public sewerage system if the property owner's line is within 200 feet of the public sewer. 
(c)  Except as otherwise provided in this section, it shall be unlawful for any person to construct or maintain any privy, privy vault, septic tank, cesspool or other facility intended or used for the disposal of sewage. The disposal of sewage by private disposal systems shall be permissible only in those instances where service from the available sanitary sewage system is not available. The disposal of sewage by means other than the use of the available sanitary sewage system, including the minimum lot area that can be approved for a private sewage disposal facility, shall be in accordance with local, county and state law. 
(d)  A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every building; except where one building stands at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard or driveway, the building sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one building sewer. 
(e)  All cost, expense and responsibility for the proper installation and connection of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall indemnify the board from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the building sewer. 
(f)  The size, slope, alignment and materials of construction of a building sewer and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing, testing and backfilling the trench shall all conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the board. In the absence of or in amplification of code provisions, the materials and procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the A.S.T.M. and W.P.C.F. Manual of Practice Number 9 shall apply. 
(g)  The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the board, or the procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the A.S.T.M. and the W.P.C.F. Manual of Practice Number 9. All such connections shall be made gastight and watertight. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by the manager before installation. 
(h)  Initial connections to mains and trunk line sewers are to be made into a wye connector or other connections provided in line. If for any reason a wye connector or other connection is not available, the connection to main or trunk will be made by the board. 
(i)  The sewer connection and all sewer laterals from the building to the sewer main line must be inspected by an inspector of the board of public utilities before any underground portion is covered. 
(j)  Sewer laterals that have been previously used but have been abandoned due to the razing of building structure may be used in connection with new buildings only when they are found, upon examination and test by the manager, to meet all requirements of this article. All others must be sealed to the specifications of the board of public utilities. Each individual property owner or user of the wastewater control facilities shall be entirely responsible for the maintenance of the sewer lateral located on private property. This maintenance will include repair or replacement of the service line as deemed necessary by the manager to meet specifications of the board of public utilities. 
(k)  Where a public sanitary sewer is not available, the building sewer shall be connected to a private wastewater disposal system. A formal application for either original or additional service utilizing a private wastewater disposal system must be made at the office of the board of public utilities and be duly approved before construction or reconstruction is commenced. 
(l)  All pertinent OSHA requirements shall be met. All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the board. 
(m)  Stormwater and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to such sewers as are specifically designated as storm sewers, or to a natural outlet approved by the board and ADEM. Industrial cooling water or unpolluted process waters may be discharged on approval of the board and ADEM to a storm sewer or natural outlet. 
(n)  No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain which, in turn, is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer. 
(Code 1966, § 16-17; Ord. No. 1224, § 2, 2-28-2006) 
Sec. 94-97. - New subdivision connection; regulated. 
(a)  Any "subdivision," as defined in the Hartselle Subdivision Regulations, creating two or more lots beyond the number of lots currently existing, shall connect all lots within said subdivision to the public sewer system at the point of receipt designated by Hartselle Utilities within the following distance parameters: 
(1)  Notwithstanding the provisions of section 94-96 of this article, the subdivision shall connect to the public sewer system if the subdivision's property line nearest the point of receipt is within a distance of said sewer line determined by the number of lots in the subdivision multiplied by 50 feet (i.e., 20 lots = 20 x 50 = must connect if within 1,000 feet). 
a.  In the event a subdivision is not within the foregoing distance parameters, Hartselle Utilities may, at its option, designate a point of connection requiring extension of the existing sewer system beyond the maximum connection distance as calculated above, provided that Hartselle Utilities will construct the necessary infrastructure to extend the system to the designated point of connection beyond the maximum connection distance or shall provide "aid to construction" to the developer for the full cost of construction beyond the maximum connection distance as calculated above. 
b.  The Hartselle Planning Commission shall exempt a subdivision from making connection within the distance specified in subsection (a)(1) hereof if necessary easements are not available at or below certified appraisal value and Hartselle Utilities, at its option, chooses not to pay the amount beyond the appraisal value or otherwise secure the necessary easement for construction. 
c.  The Hartselle Planning Commission shall exempt a subdivision from making connection within the distance specified in subsection (a)(1) hereof if the distance to be at the expense of the developer exceeds one-half mile or if extreme hardships exist (i.e., topography, geology), which in the opinion of the planning commission, would make connection of the subdivision to the public sewer unfeasible. It shall be the responsibility of the developer to show connection to be unfeasible. 
(b)  Major subdivisions of 30 or more lots not requiring sewer connection under the parameters of subsection (a) shall construct decentralized sewage collection and treatment infrastructure and all lots within said subdivision shall be connected to the said decentralized system. The Hartselle Planning Commission may require the installation of a decentralized system for a subdivision of fewer than 30 lots if it determines that undeveloped adjacent land is present for the development of potential future phases, or if the proposed subdivision adjoins a development previously constructed under the guides of this article. All infrastructure construction required shall be at the full cost of the developer and shall be constructed and maintained in conformance with all construction specifications of Hartselle Utilities or other lawful regulatory authority. 
(1)  Prior to approval of the subdivision final plat by the Hartselle Planning Commission, the developer shall secure an executed agreement with a state licensed sewer regulatory authority for the perpetual maintenance of the decentralized system and any individual septic tanks connected to said system, and shall provide a copy of said executed agreement to the City of Hartselle. 
(c)  Any subdivision regulated by this article that is not required to make connection under the provisions of subsections (a) or (b) of this section shall require the installation of all infrastructure within said subdivision and/or along the existing public road frontage of said subdivision as required to facilitate future connection of said subdivision to the public sewer system. All infrastructure constructed shall be at the full cost of the developer and shall be constructed in conformance with Hartselle Utilities construction specifications. 
(1)  The Hartselle Planning Commission shall exempt a subdivision from the requirements of subsection (c) of this section if Hartselle Utilities has no plans to connect the said subdivision to the public sewer within a period of three years.

Sec. 94-98. - Limitation of loading; charges. 
(a)  The board may, by resolution duly adopted, limit the BOD load that any person may discharge into the sanitary sewage system to be treated at the sewage treatment plant. The fixing by the board of such limit of discharge by any person shall not prohibit the board from altering the limit in the future when in the discretion of the board it is to the best interest of the city to do so. 
(b)  If any person discharges an industrial waste into the sanitary sewage system, which, due to the particular or unusual nature of the industrial waste discharged, other than BOD and flows for which sewer service charges are levied, imposes an unusual burden upon the sanitary sewage system or causes the board to incur additional expenses in treating the waste, such as (but not limited to) additional personnel, additional equipment or increased operating costs, such person is to pay the costs of such additional expense in addition to the other charges set forth. The board shall determine if any person is causing the board to incur additional expense and, if so, the amount of such additional expense.

Subdivision I. - In General 

Sec. 94-151. - Wastewater discharges. 
    It shall be unlawful to discharge without a permit from the board to any natural outlet within the city or in any area under the jurisdiction of the board, and/or to the municipal wastewater system any wastewater except as authorized by the superintendent of the board. 
(Code 1966, § 16-50) 
Sec. 94-152. - Exclusion of wastes. 
(a)  The board may, by resolution duly adopted, temporarily exclude any industrial waste, whether pretreated or not, from the sanitary sewage system whenever, in its opinion, such action is necessary for the purpose of determining the effects of such wastes upon the sanitary sewage system, sewage treatment works, or sewage treatment plants. 
(b)  The board may, by resolution duly adopted, exclude any industrial waste, or other waste, from the sanitary sewage system whenever, in its opinion, such action is necessary to protect the system or to facilitate the proper operation of the system. 
(Code 1966, § 16-14) 
Sec. 94-153. - Determining of character and concentration of wastes. 
    The determination of the character and concentration of the industrial wastes by the board shall be binding as basis for charges. The industry may, however, conduct its own sampling and analytical program and submit to the board the results relating to character and concentration of its wastes. Acceptance of the results submitted as a basis for computing charges shall be the decision of the board. 
(Code 1966, § 16-15) 
Sec. 94-154. - General discharge regulations. 
(a)  No user shall contribute or cause to be contributed, directly or indirectly, any pollutant or wastewater which will interfere with the operation or performance of the municipal wastewater system. It is the responsibility and duty of each property owner and/or user of the sewerage system to properly maintain all lines, pipes and equipment connected to or interacting in any way with the sanitary sewer service owned by the board and administered by the board for the city so as to prevent infiltration and inflow into the system. A user may not contribute the following substances to the city municipal wastewater system: 
(1)  Any liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their nature or quantity are, or may be, sufficient, either alone or by interaction with other substances, to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the municipal wastewater system. At no time, shall two successive readings on an explosion hazard meter, at the point of discharge into the system (or at any point in the system), be more than five percent nor any single reading over ten percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter. Prohibited materials include but are not limited to gasoline, kerosene, naphtha, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethers, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates, perchlorates, bromates, carbides, hydrides and sulfides and any other substances which the city, the state or EPA has notified the user is a fire hazard or a hazard to the system. 
(2)  Solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction to the flow in a sewer or other interference with the operation of the wastewater treatment facilities, such as but not limited to grease, garbage with particles greater than one-half inch in any dimension, animal guts or tissues, paunch manure, bones, hair, hides or fleshings, entrails, whole blood, feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, spent lime, stone or marble dust, metal, glass, straw, shavings, grass clippings, rags, spent grains, spent hops, wastepaper, wood, plastics, gas, tar, asphalt residues, residues from refining, or processing of fuel or lubricating oil, mud, or glass grinding or polishing wastes. 
(3)  Any wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 or higher than 9.0 unless the municipal wastewater system is specifically designed to accommodate such wastewater, or wastewater having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment and/or personnel of the municipal wastewater system. 
(4)  Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the municipal wastewater system, or to exceed the limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. 
a.  The discharge of sanitary wastewater into a storm sewerage system is prohibited without exception. 
b.  Ground paper products and any garbage that has not been properly shredded shall not be discharged into the sewerage system. The installation and operation of any garbage grinder equipped with a motor of three-fourths horsepower or greater shall be subject to the review and approval of the superintendent. 
(5)  Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases or solids which either singly or by interaction with other wastes are sufficient to create a public nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry into the sewers for maintenance and repair. 
(6)  Any substance which may cause the municipal wastewater system effluent or any other product of the municipal wastewater system such as residues, sludges or scums to be unsuitable for reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case, shall a substance discharged to the municipal wastewater system cause the municipal wastewater system to be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines, or regulations developed under the Clean Water Act, the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substance Control Act, or state criteria applicable to the sludge management method being used. 
(7)  Any substance which will cause the municipal wastewater system to violate its NPDES and/or state disposal system permit or the receiving water quality standards. 
(8)  Any wastewater with objectionable color not removed in the treatment process, such as but not limited to dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions. 
(9)  Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological activity in the municipal wastewater system treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater with a temperature at the introduction into the municipal wastewater system which exceeds 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). The temperature or effluent entering the sewers, pipes or other conveyances leading to the treatment plant may not exceed 65 degrees Celsius (150 degrees Fahrenheit). 
(10)  Any pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.), released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which a user knows or has reason to know will cause interference to the municipal wastewater system. In no case shall a slug load have a flow rate or contain concentration or qualities of pollutants that exceed for any time period longer than 15 minutes more than five times the average 24-hour concentration, quantities or flow during normal operation. 
(11)  Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the superintendent in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations. 
(12)  Any wastewater which causes a hazard to human life or creates a public nuisance. 
(b)  When the superintendent determines that a user is contributing to the municipal wastewater system, any of the substances enumerated in subsection (a) of this section in such amounts as to interfere with the operation of the municipal wastewater system, the superintendent shall: 
(1)  Advise the users of the impact of the contribution on the municipal wastewater system; and 
(2)  Develop effluent limitations for such user to correct the interference with the municipal wastewater system. 
(c)  The superintendent or his designated agent shall be permitted to enter upon the property of any user of the sewerage system, whether residential or commercial, for the purpose of inspecting the user's lines, pipes and equipment. 
(d)  If it is determined that a property owner has failed to maintain his equipment so as to prevent infiltration and/or inflow, written notice shall be given by the posting of such notice on the front door of the residence or structure being served by the defective equipment and by mailing a certified letter containing the notice to the property owner's last known address. 
(e)  The property owner shall have 14 working days from the date the notice is placed in the mail, to correct any defects in the equipment. For the purpose of these regulations, failure of the property owner to correct such defects shall be deemed prima facie evidence of the property owner's intentional violation of these regulations and related ordinances and shall bar any defenses by the property owner which relate to awareness of these regulations or related ordinances or the intention to violate these regulations. 
(f)  If the defects are not corrected by the property owner within 21 working days from the date the notice was mailed and the city or the board deems it necessary to correct such defects, the total expense of such corrections, including but not being limited to legal, accounting and engineering expenses, shall be charged to the property owner and will constitute a lien against the property owner to be collected as provided by the law. 
(g)  The board, in lieu of correcting a property owner's defects, may, after notice provided in this article, suspend all service to the property owner, both at the address where the defects are noted, as well as other locations owned by the property owner. 
(Code 1966, § 16-30) 
Sec. 94-155. - Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards. 
    Upon the promulgation of the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this article for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this article. The control authority shall notify all affected users of all applicable reporting requirements. 
(Code 1966, § 16-31) 
Sec. 94-156. - Modification of Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards. 
    Where the wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the board may apply to the approval authority for modification of specific limits in the federal pretreatment standards. Consistent removal means reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the system in 95 percent of the samples taken when measured according to the procedures set forth in the "General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution" promulgated pursuant to the act. The board may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the federal pretreatment standards if prior approval from the approval authority is obtained. 
(Code 1966, § 16-32) 
Sec. 94-157. - Specific pollutant limitations. 
    No person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the parameters shown in Table Number 1 (following section 94-162). 
(Code 1966, § 16-33) 
Sec. 94-158. - State requirements. 
    State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations or those in this article. 
(Code 1966, § 16-34) 
Sec. 94-159. - City's right of revision. 
    The city reserves the right to establish by ordinance more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the wastewater disposal system if deemed necessary to comply with the objectives presented in section 94-154. 
(Code 1966, § 16-35) 
Sec. 94-160. - Excessive discharges. 
    No user shall ever increase the use of process water or, in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards, or in any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by the board or the state. Dilution may be an acceptable means of complying with some of the prohibitions set forth in section 94-154, e.g. the pH prohibition. 
(Code 1966, § 16-36) 
Sec. 94-161. - Accidental discharges. 
    Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this article. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection by the board before construction of the facility. All existing users shall complete such a plan by January 1, 1984. No user who commences contribution to the municipal wastewater system after the effective date of this article shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the board. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone and notify the control authority of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. 
(1)  Written notice. Within five days following an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the control authority a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the municipal wastewater system, fish kills, or any damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law. 
(2)  Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(Code 1966, § 16-37) 
Sec. 94-162. - Variances from categorical pretreatment standards; fundamentally different factors (FDF). 
(a)  In some cases, information which may affect the pretreatment standards will not be available or, for other reasons, will not be considered during their development. As a result, it may be necessary on a case-by-case basis to adjust the limits in categorical pretreatment standards, making them either more or less stringent, as they apply to a certain industrial user. The modified standard will, in effect, acknowledge that the industrial user in question is fundamentally different from other facilities considered by the EPA in developing the categorical standards. 
(b)  Any interested user believing that there are fundamentally different factors related to that user and, further, that the existence of those factors justifies a different discharge limit from that specified in the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, may request an FDF variance. Requests for FDF variances will be processed according to the procedures set forth in "General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution" promulgated pursuant to the act. The board may modify pollutant discharge limits in the federal pretreatment standard if the aforementioned procedures are fulfilled and prior approval from the approval authority is obtained.

(Code 1966, § 16-53) 
Sec. 94-164. - Inspection and sampling. 
    The board and/or the ADEM shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this article is being met. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the board, the ADEM or their representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination or in the performance of any of their duties. The board, approval authority and the EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry onto the premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the board, approval authority and the EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. 
(Code 1966, § 16-54) 
Sec. 94-165. - Pretreatment. 
(a)  Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards within the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the board shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the board and the ADEM for review and shall be acceptable to the board and the ADEM before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the board and the ADEM under the provisions of this article. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the board and the ADEM prior to the user's initiation of the changes. 
(b)  The board shall annually publish in a local newspaper a list of the users which were significant violators of any pretreatment requirements or standards during the 12 previous months. The notification shall also summarize any enforcement actions taken against the users during the same 12 months. 
(c)  All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be made available to officials of the EPA or approval authority upon request.

c.  Rear yard: 25 feet. 
d.  Lots adjoining major thoroughfares: Where R-5 lots adjoin (in any manner or configuration) a major thoroughfare (i.e. collector street or higher classification), an additional 20-foot setback shall be added to those setback requirements set forth in subsections (4)(a) through (4)(c) of section 21.2 and shall be measured from the right-of-way. 
e.  Lots adjoining those of a different zoning district: Where R-5 lots adjoin (in any manner or configuration) those in any other zoning district, minimum building setbacks from the common property line shall be equal to or greater than the minimum required in the adjoining district. 
(4)  Maximum building area: 50 percent of lot area. 
(5)  Maximum density: Seven dwelling units per gross acre. 
(e)  Structural requirements. 
(1)  Maximum building height: 35 feet. 
(f)  Vehicular access. No lot within an R-5 district shall have direct vehicular access to an existing or planned major thoroughfare (i.e. "collector street" or higher street classification) as defined by the comprehensive plan, zoning ordinance, or future plans adopted by the Hartselle Planning Commission.

(Ord. No. 1010, § 2, 3-11-1999) 
Sec. 21.5. - Planned unit development (PUD). 
(a)  Intent. It is the intent of the PUD zone to permit a single zoning designation for developments planned to include a variation of residential and/or community shopping and service uses. The PUD zone, when approved in accordance with the preapproved master plan, is intended to grant the developer the ability to integrate a variety of uses without the establishment of multiple traditional zoning types. In exchange for this increased flexibility, the developer is required to provide common open space and amenities in excess of that required in traditional residential subdivisions. This exchange is intended to benefit the residents of the community through increased amenities and improved environmental protection and the city as a whole through the allowance of more unique and creative development designs. 
(b)  Implementation procedure. 
(1)  In order to obtain PUD zoning, the developer must submit a standard application for rezoning, signed by all property owners, and master plan of all phases of the development to the Hartselle Planning Commission for consideration and approval. 
(2)  The submittal fee for the rezoning application shall be $150.00 plus advertising costs and the submittal fee for the preliminary master plan review shall be established based on the number of lots in all phases of the planned unit development as established for traditional layout plat submittals in the Hartselle Subdivision Regulations. 
(3)  The master plan, application for rezoning, and all fees shall be submitted to the commission for consideration at the same meeting. 
(4)  The submitted master plan shall include all elements required for a standard subdivision layout plat and shall also include a boundary designation of traditional zoning areas within the development (i.e., R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, or B-1). These traditional zoning designations will determine the use, lot size, and setback standards for that area as stated in the regulations of that standard zoning type. Once approved, these area designations shall not be revised except with the resubmittal of the full master plan with submittal fee and approval thereof by the planning commission. 
(5)  Upon approval of the master plan, the commission may forward a recommendation to approve a PUD zoning designation to the city council for the entire development property. Under no circumstances shall PUD zoning be granted for only a portion or single phase of the master planned property. 
(6)  Following approval of the master plan by the planning commission, the city council shall hold public hearing on the matter and make a final ruling with regard to the zoning of the property to PUD under advisement of the planning commission recommendation. Under no circumstances shall a property be zoned to PUD without the preliminary approval of the development master plan by the planning commission. 
(7)  In cases where PUD zoning is granted by the city council and the developer wishes to proceed with the development of the entire master planned property in a single phase, submittal of engineering plans for the development and the appropriate filing fee as designated in the Hartselle Subdivision Regulations may be submitted to the Hartselle Planning Commission for review as scheduled in the Hartselle Subdivision Regulations. 
(8)  In cases where PUD zoning is granted by the city council and the developer wishes to proceed with the development of less than 100 percent of the development in phases, the developer shall resubmit a layout plat of the phase(s) to be initiated with the submittal fee as designated in the Hartselle Subdivision Regulations to the Hartselle Planning Commission for approval prior to the submittal of engineering plans. 
(c)  General provisions. 
(1)  Under no circumstances shall a parcel or combination of parcels totaling less than 30 acres be zoned PUD. 
(2)  Under no circumstances shall a portion of an approved PUD zone be rezoned to another zoning designation without resubmittal and approval of the revised master plan by the planning commission and a minimum of 30 acres remaining zoned PUD. 
(3)  Under no circumstances shall a single phase of a planned unit development be considered on less than 15 acres. 
(4)  Under no circumstances shall less than 15 percent of the land area of any individual planned unit development phase be designated as common open space as defined in section IV. An exception to this requirement may be considered by the planning commission in cases where the 15 percent required common open space for the phase, or fraction thereof, was fulfilled within a previously developed phase. In such cases, the planning commission may approve construction of the phase with only common open space set aside as needed to continue overall 15 percent allotment for the subdivision as developed and in conformance with all other requirements for common open space areas. 
(5)  All parcels within a phase of the planned unit development shall be numbered as lots, including those areas designated as common open space, and shall further be considered as lots for the purpose of assessing submittal fees as stated in section II. 
(d)  Commercial use areas. 
(1)  Under no circumstances shall more than 10 percent of the land area of any individual planned unit development phase be designated and/or used for B-1 purposes. 
(2)  Under no circumstances shall the operation of B-1 establishments within an approved planned unit development phase be permitted prior to the completion of all common open space areas and at least 50 percent of the residential units within that phase, including the issuance of certificates of occupancy for all said residential units. 
(3)  Under no circumstances shall a structure within a B-1 area exceed 5,000 square feet in size. 
(4)  Any establishment located within a B-1 area shall be subject to all site plan submittal, review and approval requirements of the Hartselle Subdivision Regulations prior to their construction within the planned unit development. 
(5)  The expansion or exterior reconfiguration of any building or reconfiguration of any commercial site within a B-1 area of a planned unit development shall be subject to all site plan submittal, review and approval requirements of the Hartselle Subdivision Regulations prior to implementation. 
(6)  The planning commission may require specific building placement, exterior building materials, and landscaping in excess of typical commercial site measures as deemed necessary to ensure aesthetic harmony with the surrounding community. Under no circumstances shall metal or exposed cinder block buildings be permitted. 
(e)  Common open space. 
(1)  Common open space shall be considered as parks, lakes, walking trails, playgrounds, picnic areas, or pavilions owned and maintained by the owners association or similar body for perpetual use by the residents of the community or, when accepted by the city council, owned by the City of Hartselle for perpetual use by all residents of Hartselle. 
(2)  Under no circumstances shall streets, required sidewalks, residential yards, street or other rights-of-way, center medians, B-1 use areas and/or establishments, entryway gardens, parking lots or storage facilities of any kind be considered as common open space. 
(3)  Undeveloped property such as forested areas or grassland may be considered as open common area when improved for safety and maintained so that such areas may be used for walking, hiking, and outdoor recreation. 
(4)  Common open space required for any individual planned unit development phase shall be set aside in tracts of no more than 10 acres in size. An exception to this requirement may be granted by the planning commission in cases where a large lake and/or walking trail is proposed, in which case the area required for the development of such a feature may be increased beyond ten acres as deemed necessary by the planning commission. 
(5)  Under no circumstances shall a combination of tracts less than one acre each in size together comprise more than 25 percent of required common open space in a development phase. 
(6)  Upon review of the master plan, the planning commission may determine a proposed common open space to be inappropriate for such use due to location, topography, access, easements or other reasons. In such cases, the proposed common space shall not be counted toward the fulfillment of the 15 percent common open space requirement. 
(f)  Permitted uses. 
(1)  The preapproved development master plan shall include defined areas classified as either R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, or B-1. 
(2)  In all areas within any phase of a planned unit development designated for R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, or R-5 purposes, uses permitted, permitted on appeal or prohibited shall be the same as those uses defined in the Hartselle Zoning Ordinance for that traditional zoning type. 
(3)  In all areas within any phase of a planned unit development designated for B-1 purposes, the following use regulations shall apply.

To this end, the building inspector of the city shall require that every application for a building permit for excavation, construction, use of land, moving or alteration be accompanied by a plan or plat drawn to scale and showing the following in sufficient detail to enable the building inspector of the city to ascertain whether the proposed excavation, construction, use of land, moving or alteration is in conformance with this ordinance:

If an application for a building permit is not approved, the building inspector of the city shall state in writing on the application the cause for such disapproval.
