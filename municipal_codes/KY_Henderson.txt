PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Henderson of a general and permanent nature. 
    The chapters of the Code are arranged in alphabetical order and the sections within each chapter are catchlined to facilitate usage. Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1968 Code of Ordinances, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of the volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1968 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant provisions of the state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash representing the chapter number and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the third section of chapter 6 is 6-3. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 6-3 and 6-4 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 6-3.1, 6-3.2 and 6-3.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13 it will be designated as chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology and still others in language generally used by government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental service, by which the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part thereof. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of George R. Langford, President, and Bill Carroll, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

(b)  Any officer or employee who is liable for the payment of any claims or damages, excluding punitive damages, arising out of the course and scope of employment shall be entitled to indemnification by the city provided that the acts or omissions resulting in such liability were done in good faith and without malicious or felonious intent. For the purposes of this section, the term "arising out of the course and scope of employment" shall not include any action which occurs during a period of time in which the officer or employee is engaged in outside employment or is rendering contractual services to someone other than the city. Whether the acts were done in good faith, without malicious or felonious intent, and within the course and scope of employment shall be determined by the city, and such determination shall be final for the purposes of the representation and indemnity of this section; provided, however, that in the event such representation and indemnity have been denied by the city, if upon a trial on the merits the city determines that the officer or employee was acting in good faith, without malicious or felonious intent and within the scope of employment, the indemnification hereunder shall be granted and reasonable legal expenses incurred in the defense of the claim reimbursed. The city shall not be liable for any settlement of any such claim or suit made without its consent, and the city reserves the right to assert any defense and make any settlement of any claim or suit that it deems expedient. 
(c)  The city shall have the right and duty to provide legal representation through the city attorney, or in its discretion through the selection of outside legal counsel, to any officer or employee sued in connection with any claim for damages or other civil action against such person arising out of the course and scope of employment, provided that such officer or employee is entitled to indemnification as set forth in this section. Such legal representation shall be provided at no cost to the officer or employee, and any officer or employee may have his or her own counsel assist in the defense at the sole expense of the officer or employee. The officer or employee shall cooperate fully with the city in preparation and representation of the case, and the failure to cooperate shall waive such officer's or employee's right to representation and indemnity under this section. 
(d)  Nothing in this section shall be construed as waiving the city's defense of governmental immunity to it or the officer or employee in any action brought against the city or such persons.

Chapter 2.5 - SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 28-02, adopted Aug. 27, 2002, amended chapter 2.5 in its entirety and adopted similar provisions as set out herein. The former chapter 2.5 derived from Ord. No. 21-93, §§ I-XV, adopted July 2, 1993. 
Cross reference- Alcoholic beverages, § 4-1 et seq.; minors, § 16-21 et seq.; occupational licenses, § 21-31 et seq.; zoning, App. A. 

Sec. 2.5-1. - Purpose and findings. 
(a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. 
(b)  Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses as set forth in reports made available to the board of commissioners, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976); FW/PBS, Inc., v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215 (1990); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 120 S. Ct. 1382 (2000); and on studies in other communities including, but not limited to: Dallas, Texas; Town and Village of Ellicottville, New York; Tucson, Arizona; St. Mary's, Georgia; St. Croix County, Wisconsin; Newport News, Virginia; and Garden Grove, California; and also on findings from the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group On The Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the board of commissioners finds: 
(1)  Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. 
(2)  Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses, defined in this chapter as adult theaters and adult cabarets, engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments. 
(3)  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows. 
(4)  Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. 
(5)  Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses. 
(6)  Communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, non A, non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections. 
(7)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. 
(8)  The sale, use, distribution or consumption of alcoholic beverages in sexually oriented businesses tends to foster criminal behavior and create undesirable community conditions. Among such acts of criminal behavior include disorderly conduct, prostitution, and drug trafficking and use. 
(9)  The findings noted in subsections (1) through (8) raise substantial governmental concerns. 
(10)  Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
(11)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
(12)  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters. 
(13)  Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments. 
(14)  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. 
(15)  In the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases, it is desirable to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this chapter is designed to prevent, or who are likely to be witnesses to such conduct. 
(16)  The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this chapter. 
(17)  The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to, and prevents conduct which leads to, the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. 
(18)  The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

In any instance in which a colony exhibits unusual aggressive characteristics by stinging or attempting to sting without due provocation or exhibits an unusual disposition toward swarming, it shall be the duty of the beekeeper to promptly requeen the colony with the queen selected from European stock bred for gentleness and non-swarming characteristics. 
(d)  Hives shall be continually managed to provide adequate living space for their resident bees to reduce the likelihood of swarming. Hives shall be requeened no less than once every two (2) years to help prevent swarming. 
(e)  To minimize contact with humans and domesticated animals and accidental intrusion by children, hives shall be surrounded by a structure at least six (6) feet in height consisting of a solid wall, fence, dense vegetation or combination thereof so that all bees are forced to fly at an elevation of at least six (6) feet above ground level in the vicinity of the apiary. 
(f)  Each beekeeper shall ensure that a source of water convenient to the bees is available at all times during the year so that the bees will not congregate at swimming pools, bibcocks, pet watering bowls, bird baths or other water sources where they may cause human, bird or domesticated animal contact on public or private property.

(l)  The code enforcement officer and/or his or her designee shall be responsible for insuring compliance with this section and for investigating any complaints or information that colonies of bees within the city are not being kept in compliance with this section or constitute a public nuisance. If the code enforcement officer or his or her designee after investigation is of the opinion that grounds exist to believe that a colony or colonies of bees are being kept in violation of the section, the code enforcement officer shall serve upon the keeper of the bees by personal service or certified mail a notice of violation specifying the nature of the violation, the action to be taken in order to comply with this section, and the time in which to comply with this section not to exceed fifteen (15) days from the date of the notice. In the event the beekeeper fails to bring the colony or hive into compliance with this section within the period specified by the code enforcement officer, the code enforcement officer or his or her designee may enter upon the property and cause the bees to be destroyed or relocated outside of the city at the expense of the beekeeper.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Nonamendatory Ord. No. 9-94, §§ 1-7, adopted April 26, 1994, has been included herein as a new Ch. 7.5, Art. II, §§ 7.5-21-7.5-28, at the discretion of the editor. 

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Secs. 7.5-1-7.5-20. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - REGULATION OF CHARGES AND RATES 

Sec. 7.5-21. - Scope and applicability. 
    This article governs the regulation of rates for basic service and equipment within the City of Henderson, Kentucky for any franchisee which has been notified that (a) the city has been certified to regulate its basic service and equipment rates; and (b) the city has adopted regulations governing regulation of basic service and equipment rates. The provisions set forth below are intended to be consistent with all Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") regulations governing the regulation of basic service rates and equipment, and the city will regulate and interpret its rules so that they are consistent with FCC regulations, as if those regulations were set forth in full herein; the franchisee is prohibited from engaging in any activity it is prohibited in engaging in under FCC rules, as if those rules were set forth in full herein. For purposes of these provisions, the term "basic service" or "basic cable service" has the same meaning as the term "basic service" at 47 C.F.R. Section 76.901 and the term "equipment" refers to all equipment and services subject to regulation under 47 C.F.R. Section 76.923. 
(Ord. No. 9-94, § 0.1, 4-26-94) 
Sec. 7.5-22. - Filing and review of rates. 
(a)  Initial filings by franchisees. 
(1)  Filings-When made. A franchisee that is notified that its basic service and equipment rates are subject to regulation must file a submission ("the rate filing") within thirty (30) days of the notification (but no earlier than November 15, 1993), justifying its then-existing basic service and equipment rates. All rates, for all customer classifications must be justified. Once a franchisee has been so notified by the city that its rates are subject to regulation, it may not thereafter increase its rates for basic service or equipment without the prior approval of the city. This requirement applies in all cases, including with respect to increases in rates announced prior to the date the operator was notified its rates were subject to regulation where the increases were not implemented prior to the date of notice. A franchisee must submit a rate filing to justify any increase in basic service or equipment rates or any new basic service or equipment rate (collectively referred to herein as rate increases). An increase occurs when there is an increase in rates or a decrease in program or customer services. Rate filings proposing and supporting rate increases must be filed for review at least thirty (30) days in advance of the proposed effective date of the increase. This requirement does not alter or eliminate any other notice requirement. 
(2)  Filing-Where made. Every rate filing must be submitted to the city manager or his designee. A rate filing shall be considered filed for review on the date the required rate filing and all required copies are received by the city manager or his designee. Ten (10) copies of each rate filing (including all supporting materials and any proprietary information) must be submitted. If the operator claims any part of the filing is proprietary, it shall additionally file ten (10) copies, which omit the proprietary information. 
(3)  Filing-Contents. Subject to any FCC regulations governing the burden of proof, a rate filing submitted by a franchisee must show that the rates the franchisee proposes to charge for basic service and equipment are reasonable. Except as inconsistent with FCC rules: 
a.  Every rate filing must clearly state in a covering letter whether it justifies existing rates; or proposes an increase in rates. The covering letter must also identify any rate that is derived in whole or in part based upon cost of service, and identify any pages of the rate filing that contain information that the franchisee claims is proprietary. It must state whether any part of the proposed increase is based on an inflation adjustment or an alleged increase in external costs. The cover letter should also contain a brief narrative description of any proposed changes in rates or in service. 
b.  The pages of each rate filing must be numbered sequentially. 
c.  The rate filing must contain all applicable FCC forms and these forms must be correctly completed. 
d.  If different rates are proposed for basic service for different classes of customers, the filing must show that the classifications and the differences in the rate charged are reasonable and consistent with federal law. 
(4)  If the franchisee seeks to support a rate based upon a cost of service, the city will establish a rate that provides the franchisee an opportunity to recover the reasonable costs associated with providing basic cable service, including a reasonable profit. An expense or investment is not presumed reasonable merely because the franchisee has incurred or made it. A franchisee is not entitled to recover monopoly profits in any form. 
(5)  In addition to information the city requires the franchisee to provide, and unless the city grants a waiver of this provision, a franchisee who seeks to justify all or any part of its rates based upon its cost of service must submit a complete cost of service analysis that shows all expenses it incurs and all revenues derived from the system, directly or indirectly by the franchisee or any person that constitutes a cable operator of the system within the meaning of 47 U.S.C. Section 522(4). The cost of service must identify the accounting level (as that term is used in the FCC's regulations) at which each expense or revenue identified as aggregated and show clearly how the expense or revenue was allocated. The franchisee may not include costs at an accounting level unless it also includes all revenues from the same level attributable to the system or to a group of systems of which the system serving the city is a part. The replacement cost of a comparable system must be identified and supported. The franchisee must identify the name and address of any entity with which it has a contract, other than a programmer, which derives revenues from the system, and must state whether and how the revenues of that entity were included in the cost of service. In addition, the cost of service shall clearly show the derivation of a proposed charge per channel and the application of that charge to yield a basic service rate. It must also show and support the derivation and allocation of any amounts included in the derivation of the rate for: 
a.  Operation and maintenance expenses; 
b.  Administrative and general expenses; 
c.  Programming expenses (identifying retransmission consent costs and copyright fees separately); 
d.  Costs for PEG access and any institutional network; 
e.  Franchise fee expenses; 
f.  Investment in the system and associated depreciation; 
g.  Other expenses, including federal, state and local taxes, itemized; and 
h.  The proposed return on equity and actual interest expense paid by the franchisee. 
(6)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a franchisee is not required to submit the cost of service specified in subsection 7.5-22(a)(5) for equipment rates, and instead initially shall complete, submit and support the costs of equipment using applicable FCC forms. Any cost of service submitted to justify basic service rates must show that the cost of service does not include equipment costs. 
(b)  Initial city review. 
(1)  After receiving a rate filing, the city manager or his designee promptly shall publish a notice that a filing has been received and that, except for those parts which may be withheld as proprietary, it is available for public review. The notice shall state that interested parties may comment on the filing, and shall provide interested parties seven (7) days to submit written comments on the filing to the city manager or his designee. The city manager or his designee shall submit the comments received and its recommendations for action to the board of commissioners of the city no later than twenty (20) days after the filing and shall make those recommendations available for public inspection. The franchisee may submit a response to public comments or staff recommendations, but must do so no later than three (3) business days after the staff recommendations are submitted to the board of commissioners of the city. The response shall be filed with the city manager or his designee, and if submitted in a timely fashion, the city manager or his designee shall forward a copy to the board of commissioners. 
(2)  Within thirty (30) days of the date of the filing, the board of commissioners shall issue a written order, which may be in any lawful form, approving the proposed rate in whole or in part; denying the proposed rate in whole or in part; or tolling the proposed rate in whole or in part. If the board of commissioners tolls the rate in whole or in part, its written order at a minimum shall explain that it requires additional time to review the rate filing and state that the franchisee may cure any deficiency in its filing by submitting a supplementary filing as provided in subsection 7.5-22(c). With respect to existing rates, tolling means the rates may remain in effect, subject to refund; with respect to rate changes, tolling means the portion of the rate change that is tolled may not go into effect. 
(c)  Supplementary filings. 
(1)  If a proposed rate is tolled in whole or in part, the franchisee shall submit a supplementary filing twenty (20) days from the effective date of the tolling order, containing corrections, if any, to its filing (including any required supplement to its cost of service filing) and any response to information filed by interested parties or to the recommendations of the staff, or any additional information necessary to support the proposed rate. Supplementary filings must be filed in accordance with subsection 7.5-22(a)(2). 
(2)  A supplementary filing also must contain such information as the city directs the franchisee to provide. 
(3)  The city may also issue additional requests for information as necessary to make the determinations required hereunder and under FCC rules. 
(4)  In addition to information the city requires the franchisee to provide, and unless the city grants a waiver of this provision, a franchisee who claims that it is entitled to a rate in whole or in part based upon the adjustments for inflation and external costs contemplated by 47 C.F.R. sections 76.922(d)(1), (2) must submit the following: 
a.  A calculation showing how each part of the adjustment was derived. 
b.  A statement itemizing each external cost (as defined by FCC regulations), the amount of that external cost for the 2 calendar years prior to the date of the filing and the year-to-date in which the filing is made; and the projected amount of the external cost for the remainder of the year in which the filing is made and for the following calendar year. The statement must specifically show any increases in revenues from programming services. "Revenues" include all revenues, in whatever form received. Failure to provide the information as requested by the franchising authority shall result in the withdrawal of the operator's rate filing. 
c.  If the increase is attributable to any increase in programming service costs, the contract for each programming service whose cost has increased; a sworn statement identifying each programming service whose costs increased where the programmer is an affiliate of the franchisee (as defined by FCC regulations); and, for any contract that has been in effect less than twelve (12) months, the prior contract for the service. 
d.  A sworn statement by the franchisee's chief financial officer or an independent, certified accountant stating that he or she has examined all external costs (including all programming costs) and has offset against any increase claimed, the amount of any decreases in external costs, and the amount by which any increase in external costs was below the GNP-PI, as required by 47 C.F.R. Section 76.922(d)(2); affirming that the franchisee has only sought to recover any external cost to the extent that cost exceeded the GNP-PI; and affirming that the franchisee has not attempted to recover any increase in the cost of programming purchased by an affiliate except as provided in 47 C.F.R. Section 76.922(d)(2)(vi). 
(5)  Upon receiving the supplementary filing, the city manager or his designee promptly shall publish a notice that a filing has been received and that it is available for public review (except those parts which may be withheld as proprietary). The notice shall state that interested parties may comment on the filing, and shall provide interested parties twenty (20) days to submit written comments on the filing to the city manager or his designee. The city manager or his designee shall submit the comments received and its recommendations for action to the board of commissioners no later than thirty (30) days prior to the date the board of commissioners must act under subsection 7.5-22(c)(7). 
(6)  The recommendations of staff shall be made available for public inspection. The franchisee may submit a response to public comments or staff recommendations, but must do so no later than ten (10) days after the staff recommendations are submitted to the board of commissioners. The response shall be filed with the city manager or his designee, and if submitted in a timely fashion, the city manager or his designee shall forward a copy to the board of commissioners. 
(7)  The board of commissioners shall issue a written order which may be in any lawful form, approving the proposed rate in whole or in part; denying the proposed rate in whole or in part; or allowing the rate to go into effect in whole or in part, subject to refund. If the board of commissioners issues an order allowing the rates to go into effect subject to refund, it shall also direct the franchisee to maintain an accounting in accordance with 47 C.F.R. Section 76.933. 
(8)  The order specified in subsection 7.5-22(c)(5) shall be adopted within ninety (90) days after the tolling order for any rate the franchisee justifies based on the FCC benchmark. The order shall be adopted within one hundred fifty (150) days of the tolling order for any rate the franchisee justified with a cost of service showing. 
(Ord. No. 9-94, § 1, 4-26-94) 
Sec. 7.5-23. - Provisions generally applicable to rate orders. 
(a)  Any rate order board of commissioners shall be issued and effective upon adoption. Each rate order shall be released to the public and the franchisee. In any case where the board of commissioners approves, denies, or tolls a rate; orders that a rate may go into effect subject to refund; or orders refunds or establishes rates, a public notice shall be published stating that the order has issued and is available for review. Any such order shall be in writing. 
(b)  The board of commissioners may take any steps that it is not prohibited from taking by federal law to protect the public interest as part of any rate order or by any other means. By way of illustration and not limitation, it may require refunds, set rates, and impose forfeitures and penalties directly or through its delegated representatives, and enforce refund orders. Any order prescribing a rate must explain why the franchisee's proposed rate was unreasonable and why the prescribed rate is reasonable. However, before prescribing a rate or ordering a refund to subscribers, the board of commissioners shall ensure the franchisee has had notice and opportunity to comment on the proposed rate or refunds. If the recommendations of the city manager or his designee propose a refund or a rate, then mailing a copy of the recommendation to the franchisee at the time it is submitted to the board of commissioners shall be deemed to provide the franchisee this notice and the franchisee must comment on the refund or rate in its response to the recommendations. 
(c)  No order approving or setting a rate using the FCC benchmarks shall be interpreted to establish the just and reasonable rate to subscribers. Every such rate approved or established shall be subject to further reduction and refund to the extent permitted under applicable laws and regulations, as the same may be amended from time to time. By way of illustration and not limitation, should the FCC reduce the benchmarks, the city shall have the right to reduce a franchisee's rates and to require the franchisee to refund any amounts collected above the benchmark, except to the extent prohibited by federal law. 
(Ord. No. 9-94, § 2, 4-26-94) 
Sec. 7.5-24. - Franchisee's duties. 
(a)  A franchisee must implement remedial requirements, including prospective rate reductions and refunds, within sixty (60) days of the date the board of commissioners issues an order mandating a remedy. 
(b)  Within ninety (90) days of the date an order mandating a remedy is issued, a franchisee must file a certification, signed by an authorized representative of the cable company stating: 
(1)  Whether the franchisee has complied fully with all provisions of the board of commissioners' order; and 
(2)  Describing in detail the precise measures taken to implement the board of commissioners' order; and 
(3)  Showing how refunds (including interest) were calculated and distributed. 
(c)  It is each franchisee's responsibility to keep books and records of account so that it can refund any amounts owed to subscribers. 
(d)  It is each franchisee's duty to submit as complete a filing as possible, and knowingly withholding information or making a filing that is incomplete under applicable law shall be treated as an evasion of this ordinance. 
(e)  Information requests. 
(1)  A franchisee and any other entity that has records of revenues or expenses that are allocated to the franchisee's system must respond to requests for information from the city by deadlines established by the city. A franchisee is responsible for ensuring that such other entity responds to the city's requests. 
(2)  Because federal law limits the time available for an initial response to a filing by a franchisee, before the order contemplated by subsection 7.5-22(b) issues, the franchisee must be prepared to respond to requests for information regarding its filing within five (5) days of the date an information request is mailed to it. The information may include the information the franchisee would be required to provide as part of any supplementary filing. 
(Ord. No. 9-94, § 3, 4-26-94) 
Sec. 7.5-25. - Duties of designated official responsible for rates. 
(a)  The city manager or his designee shall be responsible for administering the provisions herein. Without limitation and by way of illustration: 
(1)  The city manager or his designee shall ensure notices are given to the public and each franchisee as required herein and by FCC regulations. 
(2)  The city manager or his designee may submit requests for information to the franchisee and establish deadlines for response to them, as provided in section 7.5-24. 
(3)  For good cause, the city manager or his designee may waive any provision herein or extend any deadline for filing or response except as to such matters that are mandatory under FCC regulations. 
(4)  The city manager or his designee shall rule on any request for confidentiality. 
(5)  The city manager or his designee shall prepare the recommendations to the board of commissioners contemplated by subsections 7.5-22(b), (c). If the city manager or his designee recommends that any increase be denied in whole or in part, it shall: 
a.  Propose a rate and explain the basis for its recommendation (it may propose that rates remain at existing levels); and 
b.  Recommend whether and on what basis refunds should issue; and 
c.  Notify the franchisee of its recommendations at the time it is submitted to the board of commissioners. 
(Ord. No. 9-94, § 4, 4-26-94) 
Sec. 7.5-26. - Penalties and forfeitures. 
    Except as prohibited by federal law, a franchisee shall be subject to penalties and forfeitures under this chapter, the franchise agreement or any other ordinances of the city, and its request for approval of a rate may be denied if it: 
(1)  Knowingly submits false or fraudulent information to the city in connection with any rate proceeding; 
(2)  Fails to comply with any lawful order or request of the city, including, but not limited to a request for information or an order setting rates; or 
(3)  Evades or attempts to evade federal or local rate regulation; provided that, filing for approval of a rate that is later determined to be unreasonable is not in and of itself an evasion of federal or local rate regulation. 
(4)  If the franchisee fails to provide the necessary information for a determination of rate filing or fails to comply with the Cable Act, or any applicable rules or regulations, then the rate filing shall be considered withdrawn or the request denied. 
(Ord. No. 9-94, § 5, 4-26-94) 
Sec. 7.5-27. - Proprietary information. 
(a)  If these provisions, or any request for information requires the production of proprietary information, the franchisee must produce the information. However, at the time the alleged proprietary information is submitted, a franchisee may request that specific, identified portions of its response be treated as confidential and withheld from public disclosure. The request must state the reason why the information should be treated as proprietary and the facts that support those reasons. The request for confidentiality will be granted if the city determines that the preponderance of the evidence shows that non-disclosure is consistent with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. Section 552. The city shall place in a public file for inspection any decision that results in information being withheld. If the franchisee requests confidentiality and the request is denied, (1) where the franchisee is proposing a rate increase, it may withdraw the proposal, in which case the alleged proprietary information will be returned to it; or (2) the franchisee may seek review within five (5) working days of the denial in any appropriate forum. Release of the information will be stayed pending review. The release of the said information shall be subject to judicial or administrative order for release. 
(b)  Any interested party may file a request to inspect material withheld as proprietary with the city manager or his designee. The city manager or his designee shall weigh the policy considerations favoring non-disclosure against the reasons cited for permitting inspection in light of the facts of the particular case. It will then promptly notify the requesting entity and the cable franchisee that submitted the information as to the disposition of the request. It may grant, deny or condition a request. The requesting party or the franchisee may seek review of the decision by filing an appeal with any appropriate forum. Disclosure will be stayed pending resolution of any appeal. 
(Ord. No. 9-94, § 6, 4-26-94) 
Sec. 7.5-28. - Petition for change in status. 
    Any franchisee may petition for a change in status in accordance with 47 C.F.R. Section 76.915, and the city shall consider that petition in accordance with 47 C.F.R. Section 76.915. The petition and ten (10) copies must be filed with the city manager or his designee.

ARTICLE I. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES 

Sec. 13-1. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has in KRS [ch.] 100 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Board of Commissioners of the City of Henderson, Kentucky, hereby adopts the following floodplain management ordinance, as follows. 
(Ord. No. 32-12, Exh. A, 1-8-13) 
Sec. 13-2. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of Henderson, Kentucky, are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the location in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(Ord. No. 32-12, Exh. A, 1-8-13) 
Sec. 13-3. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(a)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(b)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(c)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
(d)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
(e)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 32-12, Exh. A, 1-8-13) 
Sec. 13-4. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this chapter are: 
(a)  To protect human life and health; 
(b)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(c)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding which are generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(d)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(e)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in special flood hazard areas; 
(f)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
(g)  To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a flood area; and 
(h)  To ensure that those who occupy a special flood hazard area assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. No. 32-12, Exh. A, 1-8-13) 
ARTICLE II. - DEFINITIONS 

Sec. 13-4.1. - Words and terms defined. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
    A zone means portions of the special flood hazard area (SFHA) in which the principal source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant threat to structures. Areas of 100-year flood, base flood elevations and flood hazard factors are not determined. 
    Accessory structure means a structure located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure, the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and should be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds. 
    Accessory use means a use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal use of the parcel of land on which it is located. 
    Addition (to an existing structure) means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a fire wall. Any walled and roofed addition which is connected by a fire wall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing walls is new construction. 
    AE zones means special flood hazard areas inundated by the one-percent annual flood (100-year flood). Base flood elevations (BFEs) are determined. 
    Appeal means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this chapter or from the floodplain administrator's ruling on a request for a variance. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH zone on the City of Henderson's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the "100-year flood"). 
    Base flood elevation (BFE) means the elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one-percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    Basement means that portion of a structure having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    Breakaway wall means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the structure and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces without causing damage to the elevated portion of the structure or the supporting foundation system. 
    Community rating system (CRS) means a program developed by the Federal Insurance Administration to provide incentives to those communities in the regular program to go beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to develop extra measures for protection from flooding. 
    Community flood hazard area (CFHA) means an area that has been determined by the floodplain administrator (or other delegated, designated, or qualified community official) from available technical studies, historical information, and other available and reliable sources, which may be subject to periodic inundation by floodwaters that can adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. Included are areas downstream from dams. 
    Critical facility means any property that, if flooded, would result in severe consequences to public health and safety or a facility which, if unusable or unreachable because of flooding, would seriously and adversely affect the health and safety of the public. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to: housing likely to contain occupants not sufficiently mobile to avoid injury or death unaided during a flood; schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response installations, vehicle and equipment storage facilities, emergency operations centers likely to be called upon before, during and after a flood, public and private utility facilities important to maintaining or restoring normal services before, during and after a flood, and those facilities or installations which produce, use or store volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials, hazardous materials or hazardous waste. 
    D zone means an area in which the flood hazard is undetermined. 
    Development means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operation, or storage of equipment or materials. 
    Elevated structure means a nonbasement building built to have the lowest floor elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, pilings, columns (posts and piers), shear walls, or breakaway walls. 
    Elevation certificate means a statement certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor on the FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of certification that verifies a structure's elevation and other related information to verify compliance with this chapter. 
    Enclosure means that portion of a structure below the base flood elevation (BFE) used solely for parking of vehicles, limited storage, or access to the structure. 
    Encroachment means the physical advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, structures, permanent structures or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain. 
    Existing construction means any structure for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMS effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures". 
    Existing manufactured home park/subdivision means a manufactured home park/subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the City of Henderson based on specific technical base flood elevation data which established the area of special flood hazards. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park/subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    Five-hundred year flood [(500-year flood)] means the flood that has a 0.2-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any year. Areas subject to the 500-year flood have a moderate to low risk of flooding. 
    Flood, flooding , or floodwaters are sometimes used interchangeably, and mean: 
(1)  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; 
(2)  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; 
(3)  The condition resulting from flood-related erosion. 
    Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) means an official map of a community, issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, where the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard have been defined as zone A or as amended by FEMA by letter or otherwise. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means a map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has delineated special flood hazard areas and risk premium zones. These maps are now made available in digital format (DFIRM), but the paper copies of the maps on file are the maps of record. 
    Flood insurance study (FIS) means the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) containing flood profiles, the flood insurance rate map (FIRM), and/or the flood boundary floodway map (FBFM), and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
    Floodplain or floodprone area means any land area susceptible to being inundated by floodwaters from any source. 
    Floodplain administrator means the individual appointed by a NFIP participating community to administer and enforce the floodplain management ordinances. 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management ordinances, and open space plans. 
    Floodplain management regulations means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control), and other applications of police power, which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state and/or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    Floodproofing means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitation facilities, structures, and their contents. 
    Floodproofing certificate means a certification by a registered professional engineer or architect, on a FEMA-approved form in effect at the time of certification stating that a nonresidential structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, is watertight to a specified design elevation with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and all structural components are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy and anticipated debris impact forces. 
    Floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1) foot. Also referred to as the "regulatory floodway". 
    Floodway fringe means that area of the floodplain on either side of the regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted without additional hydraulic and/or hydrologic analysis. 
    Floor means the top surface of an enclosed area in a structure (including basement), i.e., top slab in concrete slab construction or top of wood flooring in wood frame construction. The term does not include the floor of a garage used solely for parking vehicles. 
    Fraud and victimization means, as related in Article VI, appeals and variance procedures of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the governing body will consider the fact that every newly constructed structure adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty (50) to one hundred (100) years. Structures that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages may incur. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
    Governing body means the local governing unit, i.e. County or municipality that is empowered to adopt and implement ordinances to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. The governing body may delegate administration and enforcement of this chapter to a department of local government, or to a joint city-county board. 
    Hazard potential means the possible adverse incremental consequences that result from the release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or mis-operation of a dam or appurtenances. The hazard potential classification of a dam does not reflect in any way the current condition of a dam and its appurtenant structures (e.g., safety, structural integrity, flood routing capacity). 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is: 
(1)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register. 
(2)  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
(3)  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
(4)  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior. 
    Kentucky Revised Statute [KRS] 151.250 means plans for dams, levees, etc. to be approved and permit issued by cabinet - (Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet). 
(1)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no person and no city, county or other political subdivision of the state, including levee districts, drainage districts, flood control districts or systems, or similar bodies, shall commence the construction, reconstruction, relocation or improvement of any dam, embankment, levee, dike, bridge, fill or other obstruction (except those constructed by the department of highways) across or along any stream, or in the floodway of any stream, unless the plans and specifications for such work have been submitted by the person or political subdivision responsible for the construction, reconstruction or improvement and such plans and specifications have been approved in writing by the cabinet and a permit issued. However, the cabinet by regulation may exempt those dams, embankments or other obstructions which are not of such size or type as to require approval by the cabinet in the interest of safety or retention of water supply. 
(2)  No person, city, county, or other political subdivision of the state shall commence the filing of any area with earth, debris, or any other material, or raise the level of any area in any manner, or place a structure, barrier or obstruction of any sort on any area located adjacent to a river or stream or in the floodway of the stream so that such filling, raising, or obstruction will in any way affect the flow of water in the channel or in the floodway of the stream unless plans and specifications for such work have been submitted to and approved by the cabinet and a permit issued as required in subsection (1) above. 
(3)  Nothing in this section is intended to give the cabinet any jurisdiction or control over the construction, reconstruction, improvement, enlargement, maintenance or operation of any drainage district, ditch or system established for agricultural purposes, or to require approval of the same except where such obstruction of the stream or floodway is determined by the cabinet to be a detriment or hindrance to the beneficial use of water resources in the area, and the person or political subdivision in control thereof so notified. The department for natural resources through KRS ch. 350 shall have exclusive jurisdiction over KRS ch. 151 concerning the regulation of dams, levees, embankments, dikes, bridges, fills, or other obstructions across or along any stream or in the floodway of any stream which structures are permitted under KRS ch. 350 for surface coal mining operations. 
    Letter of map change (LOMC) is an official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMC's include the following categories: 
1)  Letter of map amendment (LOMA) means a revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated SFHA. A LOMA amends the current effective FIRM and establishes that a specific property is not located in a SFHA. 
2)  Letter of map revision (LOMR) means a revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. 
3)  Letter of map revision-Fill (LOMR F) means a determination that a structure or parcel has been elevated by properly placed engineered fill above the BFE and is, therefore, excluded from the SFHA. 
    Levee means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    Levee system means a flood protection system that consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    For a levee system to be recognized, the following criteria must be met: 
(1)  All closure devices or mechanical systems for internal drainage, whether manual or automatic, must be operated in accordance with an officially adopted operation manual (a copy of which must be provided to FEMA by the operator when levee or drainage system recognition is being sought or revised). 
(2)  All operations must be under the jurisdiction of a federal or state agency, an agency created by federal or state law, or an agency of a community participating in the NFIP. 
    Limited storage means an area used for storage and intended to be limited to incidental items which can withstand exposure to the elements and have low flood damage potential. Such an area must be of flood resistant material, void of utilities except for essential lighting, and cannot be temperature controlled. 
    Lowest adjacent grade means the elevation of the sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement entryway immediately next to the structure and after the completion of construction. It does not include earth that is emplaced for aesthetic or landscape reasons around a foundation wall. It does include natural ground or properly compacted fill that comprises a component of a structure's foundation system. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, structure access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this chapter. 
    Manufactured home means a structure, transportable in one (1) or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle" (see "Recreational vehicle"). 
    Manufactured home park/subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Map means the flood hazard boundary map (FHBM) or the flood insurance rate map (FIRM) for a community issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 
    Map panel number means the four-digit number on a flood map, followed by a letter suffix, assigned by FEMA. The first four (4) digits represent the map panel. The letter suffix represents the number of times the map panel has been revised. (The letter "A" is not used by FEMA, the letter "B" is the first revision.) 
    Market value means the structure value, excluding the land (as agreed between a willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market will bear. Market value can be established by independent certified appraisal; replacement cost depreciated by age of structure (actual cash value) or adjusted assessed values. 
    Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For the purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the MSL is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain as shown on a community's FIRM. For purposes of this chapter, the term is synonymous with the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) 1988. 
    Mechanical equipment means, for the purpose of this chapter, defined as electrical, heating, air condition equipment, and other machinery or equipment servicing the structure which is not designed for immersion in water. 
    Mitigation means sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of mitigation is twofold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the costs of disaster response and recovery. 
    National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) means the federal program that makes flood insurance available to owners of property in participating communities nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the federal government and the private insurance industry. 
    New construction means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of this chapter and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of the City of Henderson's floodplain management ordinance.

    The Henderson City-County Planning Commission is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions of this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accordance with its provisions and by designating an administrative and enforcement officer, herein referred to as the floodplain administrator. 
(Ord. No. 32-12, Exh. A, 1-8-13) 
Sec. 13-14. - Permit procedures. 
    A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or other development begins within any special flood hazard area established in Section 13-6. Endorsement of the floodplain administrator is required before a state floodplain construction permit can be processed. Application for a development permit shall be made to the floodplain administrator on forms furnished by him or her prior to any development activities, and may include, but not be limited to, the following: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structure, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required: 
(1)  Application stage. 
a.  Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level of the proposed lowest floor (including basement) of all structures in zone A and elevation of highest adjacent grade; or 
b.  Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential structure will be floodproofed; 
c.  All appropriate certifications from a Kentucky registered professional engineer or architect that the nonresidential floodproofed structure will meet the floodproofing criteria in Article V, subsections 13-18(b) and 13-21(b). 
d.  Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development; and 
(2)  Construction stage. Provide a floor elevation or floodproofing certification after the lowest floor is completed. Upon placement of the lowest floor and before construction continues, or floodproofing by whatever construction means, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the floodplain administrator and to the state a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor or the floodproofed elevation, whichever is applicable as built, in relation to mean sea level. In AE and A zones where the city has adopted a regulatory base flood elevation, said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a Kentucky registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same. When floodproofing is utilized for a particular building, said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a Kentucky registered professional engineer or architect and certified by same. Any work undertaken prior to submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The floodplain administrator shall review the lowest floor and floodproofing elevation survey data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further progressive work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the survey or failure to make said correction required hereby shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project. 
(Ord. No. 32-12, Exh. A, 1-8-13) 
Sec. 13-15. - Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator. 
    The floodplain administrator and/or staff is hereby appointed, authorized and directed to administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this chapter. The floodplain administrator is further authorized to render interpretations of this chapter, which are consistent with its spirit and purpose by granting or denying development permits in accordance with its provisions. 
    The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to the following: 
(a)  Permit review. Review all development permits to ensure that: 
(1)  Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied; 
(2)  All other required state and federal permits have been obtained. Review proposed development to assure that all necessary permits have been received from those governmental agencies from which approval is required by federal or state law, including section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C 1334; 
(3)  Flood damages will be reduced in the best possible manner; and 
(4)  The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of affected watercourses. For purposes of this chapter, "adversely affects" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one (1) foot at any point. 
(b)  Review and use of any other base flood data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Article III, Section 13-6, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer Article V. Any such information shall be submitted to the appropriate governing body for adoption. 
(c)  Notification of other agencies. 
(1)  Notify adjacent communities, the Kentucky Division of Water, and any other federal and/or state agencies with statutory or regulatory authority prior to any alteration or relocation of the watercourse, and

(3)  Assure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained and not diminished. 
(d)  Documentation of floodplain development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following: 
(1)  Certification required by Article V, subsection 13-18(a)(5) (lowest floor elevations) as shown on a completed and certified elevation certificate. Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, in accordance with Article IV, subsection 13-14(b); 
(2)  Certification required by Article V, subsection 13-18(b)(4) (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures) as shown on a completed and certified floodproofing certificate. Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the new or substantially improved structures have been flood-proofed, in accordance with Article IV, subsection 13-14(b); 
(3)  Certification required by Article V, subsection 13-18(c)(1) (elevated structures); 
(4)  Certification of elevation required by Article V, subsection 13-20(h) (subdivision standards);

(7)  Review certified plans and specifications for compliance; 
(8)  Remedial action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in Article III, Section 13-12. 
(e)  Map determinations. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas, for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions. 
(1)  Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions) the floodplain administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Article VI, subsection 13-16(b); 
(2)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with Article III, Section 13-6, then the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of Article V; 
(3)  When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, the floodplain administrator shall obtain certification from a Kentucky registered professional engineer or architect, in accordance with Article V, subsection 13-18(b)(4) a floodproofing certificate; 
(4)  All records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter shall be maintained in the office of the floodplain administrator and shall be open for public inspection. 
(f)  Right of entry. 
(1)  Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the provisions of this chapter, or whenever the floodplain administrator has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any structure or upon any premises any condition or ordinance violation which makes such structure or premises unsafe, dangerous or hazardous, the floodplain administrator may enter such structure or premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same or perform any duty imposed upon the administrator by this chapter. 
(2)  If such structure or premises are occupied, he/she shall first present proper credentials and request entry. If such structure or premises are unoccupied, he shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other persons having charge or control of such request entry. 
(3)  If entry is refused, the floodplain administrator shall have recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure entry. 
(4)  When the floodplain administrator shall have first obtained a proper inspection warrant or other remedy provided by law to secure entry, no owner or occupant or any other persons having charge, care or control of any structure, or premises shall fail or neglect, after proper request is made as herein provided, to promptly permit entry therein by the administrator for the purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to this chapter. 
(g)  Stop work orders. 
(1)  Upon notice from the floodplain administrator, work on any structure or premises that is being done contrary to the provisions of this chapter shall immediately cease.

(h)  Revocation of permits. 
(1)  The floodplain administrator may revoke a permit or approval, issued under the provisions of this chapter, in case there has been any false statement or misrepresentation as to the material fact in the application or plans on which the permit or approval was based. 
(2)  The floodplain administrator may revoke a permit upon determination by the administrator that the construction, erection, alteration, repair, moving, demolition, installation, or replacement of the structure for which the permit was issued is in violation of, or not in conformity with, the provisions of this chapter. 
(i)  Liability. 
(1)  Any officer, employee, or member of the floodplain administrator's staff, charged with the enforcement of this chapter, acting for the applicable governing authority in the discharge of his duties, shall not thereby render himself personally liable, and is hereby relieved from all personal liability, for any damage that may accrue to persons or property as a result of any act required or permitted in the discharge of his duties. Any suit brought against any officer, employee, or member because of such act performed by him or her in the enforcement of any provision of this chapter shall be defended by the department of law until the final termination of the proceedings. 
(j)  Expiration of floodplain construction permit. 
(1)  A floodplain construction permit, and all provisions contained therein, shall expire if the holder of a floodplain construction permit has not commenced construction within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days from the date of its issuance by the floodplain administrator. 
(Ord. No. 32-12, Exh. A, 1-8-13) 
Sec. 13-16. - Appeals and variance procedures. 
(a)  The variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or cause damage to the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. 
    It is the duty of the City of Henderson to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level is so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance should be rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
(b)  The board of zoning adjustment as established by the City of Henderson shall hear and decide requests for variance from the requirements of this chapter and appeals of decisions or determinations made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. For purposes of this section, the board of zoning adjustment shall be referred to as the appeals board. 
(c)  The appeals board shall not hear any request for a variance from the requirements of this chapter unless the applicant has first made application to the Kentucky Division of Water and received written approval from same for any construction for which a variance is being requested. However, approval from the Kentucky Division of Water shall not guarantee approval of a request for variance from the appeals board. 
(d)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the appeals board or any taxpayer may appeal such decision to the Henderson Circuit Court, as provided in the Kentucky Revised Statutes. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section, except for Article IV, subsections 13-16(h)(1) and (4), provided the proposed reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration will not result in the structure losing its historical designation. 
(f)  In passing upon such application, the appeals board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and: 
(1)  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
(2)  The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
(3)  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
(4)  The importance to the community of the services provided by the proposed facility; 
(5)  The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, in the case of a functionally dependent facility; 
(6)  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion damage, for the proposed use; 
(7)  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
(8)  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and the floodplain management program for that area; 
(9)  The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(10)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
(11)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
(f)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above, and the purposes of this chapter, the appeals board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
(g)  Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(h)  Conditions for variances: 
(1)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the appeals board need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the appeals board believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance. 
(2)  In the instance of a historic structure, a determination shall be made that the variance is the minimum necessary to afford relief and not destroy the historic character and design of the structure; 
(3)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud or victimization of the public (as defined above), or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(4)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation; 
(5)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variance to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) upon request. 
(6)  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of Article VI, subsections 13-16(a)-(k) are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. 
(i)  Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of the floodplain administrator that: 
(1)  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance; and 
(2)  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county court clerk and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land by means of a land use restriction. 
(3)  The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in the community's biennial report submission to FEMA. 
(j)  Historic structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

ARTICLE IV. - SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES AND PLACES OF EMPLOYMENT 

Sec. 16-50. - Findings and intent. 
    The City of Henderson Board of Commissioners finds that: 
(a)  Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor to indoor air pollution. Breathing secondhand smoke is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers. These diseases include heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease and lung cancer. The National Cancer Institute determined in 1999 that secondhand smoke is responsible for the early deaths of up to sixty-five thousand (65,000) Americans annually. (National Cancer Institute (NCI), "Health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke: the report of the California Environmental Protection Agency. Smoking and Tobacco Control Monograph 10," Bethesda, MD: National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute (NCI), August 1999.) 
(b)  The Public Health Service's National Toxicology Program (NTP) has listed secondhand smoke as a known carcinogen. (Environmental Health Information Service (EHIS), "Environmental tobacco smoke: first listed in the Ninth Report on Carcinogens," U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Public Health Service, NTP, 2000; reaffirmed by the NTP in subsequent reports on carcinogens, 2003, 2005.) 
(c)  A study of hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction in Helena, Montana, before, during, and after a local law eliminating smoking in workplaces and public places was in effect, has determined that laws to enforce smoke-free workplaces and public places may be associated with a reduction in morbidity from heart disease. (Sargent, Richard P.; Shepard, Robert M.; Glantz, Stanton A., "Reduced incidence of admissions for myocardial infarction associated with public smoking ban: before and after study," British Medical Journal 328: 977-980, April 24, 2004.) 
(d)  Secondhand smoke is particularly hazardous to the elderly, individuals with cardiovascular disease and individuals with impaired respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway disease. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk of asthma, respiratory infections, sudden infant death syndrome, developmental abnormalities, and cancer. (California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal EPA), "Health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke", Tobacco Control 6(4): 346-353, Winter, 1997.) 
(e)  The Americans with Disabilities Act, which mandates access to public places and workplaces for persons with disabilities, deems impaired respiratory function to be a disability. (Daynard, R.A., "Environmental tobacco smoke and the Americans with Disabilities Act," Nonsmokers' Voice 15(1): 8-9.) 
(f)  The U.S. Surgeon General has determined that the simple separation of smokers and nonsmokers within the same air space may reduce, but does not eliminate, the exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand smoke. (Department of Health and Human Services. The Health Consequences of Involuntary Smoking: A Report of the Surgeon General. Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control, 1986.) 
(g)  The Environmental Protection Agency has determined that secondhand smoke cannot be reduced to safe levels in businesses by high rates of ventilation. Air cleaners, which are only capable of filtering the particulate matter and odors in smoke, do not eliminate the known toxins in secondhand smoke. (Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), "Indoor air facts no. 5: environmental tobacco smoke," Washington, D.C.: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), June 1989.) 
(h)  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has determined that the risk of acute myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease associated with exposure to tobacco smoke is nonlinear at low doses, increasing rapidly with relatively small doses such as those received from secondhand smoke or actively smoking one (1) or two (2) cigarettes a day and has warned that all patients at increased risk of coronary heart disease or with known coronary artery disease should avoid all indoor environments that permit smoking. (Pechacek, Terry F.; Babb, Stephen, "Commentary: How acute and reversible are the cardiovascular risks of secondhand smoke?" British Medical Journal, 328: 980-983, April 24, 2004.) 
(i)  A significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the workplace. Employees who work in smoke-filled businesses suffer a twenty-five (25) to fifty (50) percent higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as increased acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease in lung function. (Pitsavos, C.; Panagiotakos, D.B.; Chrysohoou, C.; Skoumas, J.; Tzioumis, K.; Stefanadis, C.; Toutouzas, P., "Association between exposure to environmental tobacco smoke and the development of acute coronary syndromes: the CARDIO2000 case-control study," Tobacco Control 11(3): 220-225, September 2002.) 
(j)  Smoke-filled workplaces result in higher worker absenteeism due to respiratory disease, lower productivity, higher cleaning and maintenance costs, increased health insurance rates, and increased liability claims for diseases related to exposure to secondhand smoke. ("The high price of cigarette smoking," Business & Health 15(8), Supplement A: 6-9, August 1997.) 
(k)  Numerous economic analyses examining restaurant and hotel receipts and controlling for economic variables have shown either no difference or a positive economic impact after enactment of laws requiring workplaces to be smoke-free. Creation of smoke-free workplaces is sound economic policy and provides the maximum level of employee health and safety. (Glantz, S.A.; Smith, L., The Effect of Ordinances Requiring Smoke-Free Restaurants on Restaurant Sales in the United States. American Journal of Public Health, 87:1687-1693, 1997; Colman, R.; Urbonas, C.M., "The economic impact of smoke-free workplaces: an assessment for Nova Scotia, prepared for Tobacco Control Unit, Nova Scotia Department of Health," GPI Atlantic, September 2001.) 
(l)  Smoking is a potential cause of fires; cigarette and cigar bums (sic) and ash stains on merchandise and fixtures causes economic damage to business health 15(8), Supplement A: 6-9, August 1997.) 
(m)  The smoking of tobacco is a form of air pollution, a danger to health and a material public nuisance. 
    Accordingly, the board of commissioners adopts the foregoing as justification for this article, the purpose of which is to: 
(1)  Protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places and places of employment; and 
(2)  Guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air; and 
(3)  Recognize that the public's need to breathe smoke-free air shall have priority over the individual's desire to smoke.

In the event an owner, manager, operator or employee of an establishment regulated by this article observes a person or persons violating this article, he or she shall immediately direct the person or persons in violation to extinguish the item being smoked. 
(1)  In the event the person [or persons] violating this article complies with this directive, no violation shall exist for the owner, manager, operator or employee witnessing the violation. In the event an owner, manager, operator or employee of an establishment regulated by this article observes a person or persons violating this article and fails to immediately direct the person [or persons] in violation to extinguish the item being smoked, the owner, manager, operator or employee failing to take appropriate steps required by this article shall be in violation of this article.

As an example of the reasonableness required, if there is a person violating the ordinance who, the owner, manager, operator or employee of an establishment regulated by this article is required to remove from the premises, but the person is intoxicated or otherwise reasonably believed to be unable to safely drive or conduct himself or herself if required to leave those premises, in this event the owner, manager, operator or employee may reasonably determine to allow the person violating this article to remain on the premises until appropriate arrangements may be made for the person's removal. 
In the event the person [or persons] violating this article is timely removed from the premises, no violation shall exist for any owner, manager, operator or employee related to the establishment in which these events occurred. In no event is an owner or agent of the premises to forcibly remove the person violating the article. Compliance is achieved under this subsection if the owner or agent of the premises orders the person violating the article to leave its premises and promptly notifies the police if the person refuses. 
(3)  In the event the person [or persons] violating this article fails or refuses to comply with this directive and the owner, manager, operator or employee who observed the violation or if a different person who directed the person [or persons] in violation to leave the premises, fails to take immediate and reasonable steps to obtain the removal of the person [or persons] from the premises, the owner, manager, operator or employee failing to take appropriate steps required by this article shall be in violation of this article. 
(4)  In all events, the establishment in which a violation occurs shall be in violation of this article for each violation that occurs on its premises and in connection with which the owner, manager, operator or employee fail to take appropriate steps required by this article. 
(5)  An employee who observes a person [or persons] violating this article may immediately notify his or her owner, manager or supervisor of the violation in satisfaction of the employee's responsibility under this article. The failure of the employee's owner, manager or supervisor to take appropriate steps required by this article in response to the employee's notice shall not constitute a violation on the part of the employee. 
(6)  In the event all duties required under this section are satisfied yet the person violating this article persists in his or her violation and/or refuses to vacate the premises on which the violation occurred, the owner, manager, supervisor and/or employee shall immediately contact one or more of the agencies or departments authorized above to enforce this article informing the agency or department of the circumstances of the violation. 
(7)  The mere presence of a person smoking within premises of an establishment governed by this article does not constitute a violation on the part of the establishment. The establishment and its agents shall only be charged for a violation of this article if the responsible agent[s] of the establishment fails to timely satisfy each responsibility prescribed for them in this section. 
(f)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the city, the Henderson County Health Department, an employee, or any person aggrieved by a failure to comply with this article, whether by commission or omission, including violations on the part of an owner, operator, manager, employee or other person[s] in control of a public place or a place of employment covered by this article, may bring legal action to enforce this article, either by civil action seeking injunctive relief or by criminal complaint in a court of competent jurisdiction.

ARTICLE VI. - SYNTHETIC MARIJUANA 

Sec. 16-101. - Declaration of findings and policy. 
    The board of commissioners finds that herbal incense products marketed in the United States that provide a marijuana-like high when smoked have become increasingly popular, particularly among teens and young adults and that these products consist of plant material that has been laced with chemicals that have not been approved by the FDA for human consumption. The City of Henderson further finds that the Commonwealth of Kentucky has moved to prohibit the sale and possession of similar products, but the changing nature of the products has resulted in the availability of herbal incense products that exceed the commonwealth's definition and statutes and therefore are not properly regulated by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The commission is aware that the side effects of the unregulated herbal incense products pose a threat to the public health and safety of the citizens of the City of Henderson and it is in the best interest of the city to regulate the sale and use of such products.

Sec. 21-34. - Exempted activities. 
(a)  Nonprofit organizations, as determined by the Internal Revenue Service approval of not-for-profit status, must file an application for occupational license.

(b)  The following business entities are exempt from the net profit occupational license tax and are not required to file a city occupational license return, except as otherwise noted: 
(1)  Public Service Corporations that pay an ad valorem tax on property valued and assessed by the Kentucky Department of Revenue, pursuant to the provisions of KRS 136.120. To be entitled to this exemption, companies are required to show that they are actually assessed as public service companies by the Kentucky Revenue Cabinet and that they in fact pay an ad valorem tax based on this assessment. Licensees whose businesses are predominantly nonpublic service but who are also engaged in public service activity are required to pay a license tax on their net profits derived from the nonpublic service activities apportioned to the city. 
(2)  Life insurance companies incorporated under the laws of and doing business in the commonwealth. (See KRS 136.320(4), (5)). 
(3)  Banks, trust companies, combined bank and trust companies, combined trust, banking and title businesses, and savings and loan associations, whether state or federally chartered, that are expressly exempted by KRS 92.300.

(5)  Persons whose sole business activity is the manufacture of and/or sale of alcoholic beverages. Persons engaged in the business of manufacturing and/or selling alcoholic beverages are required to file a return, but may exclude the portion of their net profits derived from such manufacturing and/or sale of alcoholic beverages. 
(6)  Any usual activities of boards of trade, chambers of commerce, trade associations or unions, community chest funds or foundations; corporations or associations organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, educational, or civic purposes, or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animal; or clubs or fraternal organizations operated exclusively for social, literary, educational, or fraternal purposes where no part of the income or receipts of such units, groups, or associations inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual. To qualify for this exemption, the organization must submit satisfactory proof of their exempt status for federal income tax purposes. If any part of the earnings of such business inures to the benefit of any person, it shall be sufficient to defeat the exemption. If an organization earns "unrelated business income," as defined and administered in section 511 of the Internal Revenue Code, a net profit license tax is assessed on the "unrelated business income." 
(7)  The farmer's market as provided for in chapter 11.5, article II, of the City's Code of Ordinances.

Sec. 21-35. - Apportionment. 
(a)  Except as provided in subsection (d), net profit shall be apportioned as follows: 
(1)  For business entities with both payroll and sales revenue in more than one (1) tax district, by multiplying the net profit by a fraction, the numerator of which is the payroll factor, described in subsection (b), plus the sales factor, described in subsection (c), and the denominator of which is two (2); and 
(2)  For business entities with sales revenue in more than one (1) tax district, by multiplying the net profit by the sales factor as set forth in subsection (c). 
(b)  The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount paid or payable in the city during the tax period by the business entity for compensation, and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid or payable by the business entity everywhere during the tax period. Compensation is paid or payable in the city based on the time the individual's service is performed within the city. 
(c)  The sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity in the city during the tax period, and the denominator of which is the total sales revenue of the business entity everywhere during the tax period. 
(1)  The sale, lease, or rental of tangible personal property is in the city if: 
a.  The property is delivered or shipped to a purchaser, other than the United States government, or to the designee of the purchaser within the city regardless of the F.O.B. point or other conditions of the sale; or 
b.  The property is shipped from an office, store, warehouse, factory, or other place of storage in the city and the purchaser is the United States government. 
(2)  Sales revenues, other than revenues from the sale, lease, or rental of tangible personal property or the lease or rental of real property, are apportioned to the city based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the time spent in performing such income-producing activity within the city and the denominator of which is the total time spent performing that income-producing activity. 
(3)  Sales revenue from the sale, lease, or rental of real property is allocated to the tax district where the property is located. 
(d)  If the apportionment provisions of this section do not fairly represent the extent of the business entity's activity in the city, the business entity may petition the city or the city may require, in respect to all or any part of the business entity's business activity, if reasonable: 
(1)  Separate accounting; 
(2)  The exclusion of any one (1) or more of the factors; 
(3)  The inclusion of one (1) or more additional factors which will fairly represent the business entity's business activity in the city; or 
(4)  The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of net profit ("alternate apportionment method"). The city must approve any alternate apportionment method prior to its implementation by the business entity. Once an alternate apportionment method is approved by the city, the business entity must apply such apportionment scheme in all future tax years, unless otherwise directed by the city. 
(e)  All partnerships, S corporations, limited liability companies, and all other entities where income is "passed through" to the owners are subject to this article. The occupational license tax imposed in this article is assessed against income before it is "passed through" these entities to the owners. 
(f)  If a business entity makes, or is required to make, a federal income tax return, the occupational license tax shall be computed for the purposes of this article on the basis of the same calendar or fiscal year required by the federal government, and the entity shall employ the same methods of accounting required for federal income tax purposes.

(b)  Every employer making payment of compensation to an employee shall deduct and withhold from the compensation due each employee at the time of payment by the employer an occupational license tax calculated under section 21-33. 
(c)  When compensation is paid or payable for work done or services performed or rendered by an employee, both within and without the city, the license tax shall be measured by that part of the compensation paid or payable as a result of work done or service performed or rendered within the city. The license tax shall be computed by obtaining the percentage of compensation for work performed or services rendered within the city as it bears to the total wages and compensation paid or payable. For the city to verify the accuracy of a taxpayer's reported percentages under this subsection, the taxpayer shall maintain adequate records. 
(d)  Subject to subsection (e) below, at a minimum, every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section shall make a return and report to the city, and pay to the city, the tax required to be withheld under this section on a quarterly basis, on or before the last day of the months of January, April, July, and October following the withholding period.

If the employer withholds, but fails to pay the amounts withheld to the city, the lien shall commence as of the date the amounts withheld were required to be paid to the city. If the employer fails to withhold these sums, the lien shall commence at the time the liability of the employer is assessed by the city. 
(h)  Every employer required to deduct and withhold tax under this section shall annually, on or before February 28 of each year, complete and file with the city an annual report of earnings reporting the tax withheld in each tax district where compensation is paid or payable to employees.

(l)  Notwithstanding subsections (f) and (j), every employee receiving compensation in the city subject to the tax imposed under section 21-33 shall be personally liable for any amount due.

The return is due on April 15 of each year, except returns made on the basis of a fiscal year, which shall be made by the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the close of the fiscal year. 
(b)  Whenever, in the opinion of the city, it is necessary to examine the federal income tax return of any business entity to audit the return, the city may compel the business entity to produce for inspection a copy of any statements and schedules in support thereof. The city may also require copies of reports of adjustments made by the federal government and/or other financial documents maintained by the business entity.

For an extension of other than the first automatic extension, the business entity must submit to the city a copy of the extension with evidence showing that the IRS has accepted and approved the requested extension. 
(b)  If the time for filing a return is extended, the business shall pay, as part of the tax, an amount equal to twelve (12) percent per annum simple interest on the tax shown due on the return, but not been previously paid, from the time the tax was due until the return is actually filed and the tax paid to the city.

(3)  A person is considered to be in violation of this division if the person connects a line conveying any pollutant to the MS4, or allows such a connection to continue. 
(g)  Suspension of MS4 access. 
(1)  Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. HWU may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person or premises when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the state. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, HWU may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the state, or to minimize danger to persons. 
(2)  Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge . Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this division may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. HWU will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the Henderson Water Utility for a reconsideration and hearing. 
(3)  [Reinstatement of MS4 access.] A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of HWU. 
(Ord. No. 06-11, 3-22-11; Ord. No. 20-14, 6-24-14) 
Sec. 23-27.1. - Industrial or construction activity discharges. 
    Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the Henderson Water Utility prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. 
(Ord. No. 06-11, 3-22-11) 
Sec. 23-27.2. - Monitoring of discharges. 
(a)  Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction activity. 
(b)  Access to facilities. 
(1)  HWU shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this division as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this division. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of HWU. 
(2)  Facility operators shall allow HWU ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law. 
(3)  HWU shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of HWU to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge. 
(4)  HWU has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
(5)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of HWU and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator. 
(6)  Unreasonable delays in allowing HWU access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this division. A person who is the operator of a facility with an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies HWU reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this division. 
(7)  If HWU has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and HWU is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this division, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this division or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then HWU may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. 
(Ord. No. 06-11, 3-22-11) 
Sec. 23-27.3. - Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce stormwater pollutants by the use of best management practices, including new development and redevelopment projects. 
(a)  Best management practices required. The Henderson Water Utility will adopt requirements identifying best management practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system, or waters of the state, including requirements during construction of new or redevelopment projects. 
(b)  Stormwater management measures post-construction. Owners or operators of any new development or redevelopment project shall design, construct and perpetually maintain stormwater management facilities or measures that will treat, filter, infiltrate, screen, harvest or reuse stormwater runoff from all impervious areas to manage stormwater quality. Facilities constructed or measures used to meet this requirement shall capture or treat all such runoff up to and including that from an eightieth percentile storm event. HWU will publish the eightieth percentile storm intensity and technical details of treatment requirements in the HWU Technical Stormwater Manual. 
(c)  Accidental discharges. The owner or operator of any development or redevelopment project, or any commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the MS4 or watercourses through the use of structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for any property or premises, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. 
(d)  Other permits. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.

Sec. 23-29. - Building sewers and connections to sanitary sewers. 
(a)  Permits. 
(1)  There shall be two (2) classes of building sewer permits required: 
a.  For residential and commercial service, and 
b.  For service to industrial establishments. 
In either case, the owner(s) or his agent shall make application on a special form furnished by the city. Applicants for service to commercial and industrial establishments shall be required to furnish information about all waste producing activities, wastewater characteristics and constituents. The permit application shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications, or other information considered pertinent in the judgment of the general manager. Details regarding commercial and industrial permits include, but are not limited to, those required by this division. Permit and inspection fees shall be paid to the city at the time the application is filed and shall be as set forth in the city's schedule of charges and fees. 
(2)  Users shall promptly notify the city in advance of any introduction of new wastewater constituents or any substantial change in the volume or character of the wastewater constituents being introduced into the POTW. The general manager may deny or condition the new introduction or change in discharge based on the information submitted in the notification or additional information as may be requested. 
(3)  No person(s) shall uncover, plug or make any connection with or opening into, use, alter, or disturb any public sanitary or combined sewer or appurtenance thereof without first obtaining permission from the general manager. Any violation of the above provision shall be subject to any and all civil and criminal penalties as outlined under section 23-34 and the penalty provisions outlined in section 23-35. 
(b)  Prohibited connections. 
(1)  No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, basement wall seepage or floor seepage, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains, or other surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer. Any such connections which already exist on the effective date of this division shall be completely and permanently disconnected within sixty (60) days of the effective date of this division. The owner(s) of any building sewers having such connections, leaks or defects shall bear all costs incidental to removal of such sources. Pipes, sumps, and pumps for such sources of ground and surface water shall be separate from wastewater facilities. Removal of such sources of water without presence of separate facilities shall be evidence of drainage to public sanitary sewer. 
(2)  Floor, basement, or crawl space drains which are lower than ground surfaces surrounding the building shall not be connected to the building sanitary sewer. Any sanitary fixture or drain which has an overflow rim less than two (2) feet above the elevation of the next upstream manhole rim shall be protected by an approved backflow prevention device. 
(3)  Construction of new combined sewers and the introduction of inflow sources to the sanitary sewer system are strictly prohibited by this division. All new construction tributary to the combined sewer system must be designed such that inflow contribution to the combined sewer system is minimized and/or delayed as much as is possible. The domestic waste connection(s) of any new buildings constructed after the effective date of this division must be distinct form the building inflow connection in order to facilitate disconnection if a storm sewer becomes available. 
(c)  Design and installations. 
(1)  A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for every building; except where one building stands at the rear of another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, courtyard, or driveway. The sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one (1) building sewer, but the city does not and will not assume any obligation or responsibility for damage caused by or resulting from any such single connection aforementioned. 
(2)  Old building sewers (more than twenty-five (25) years old) may not be used in connection with new buildings. 
(3)  Extension of customer service lines from any point on the customer's side of the tap for delivery of waste from any location other than that of the customer in whose name the tap is registered shall not be permitted. 
(4)  The building sewer shall be PVC (polyvinyl-chloride) sewer pipe, ASTM D-3034, latest revision, or ductile iron pipe, AWWA specification C-151 cement lined, and shall meet requirements of the state plumbing code. Joints shall be as set out hereinafter. Any part of the building sewer that is located within five (5) feet of a water service pipe shall be constructed with ductile iron pipe, unless the building sewer is at least one (1) foot deeper in the ground than the water service line. Ductile iron pipe may be required by the city where the building sewer is exposed to damage or stoppage by tree roots. Ductile iron pipe shall be used in filled or unstable ground, in areas where the cover over the building sewer is less than three (3) feet, or in areas where the sewer is subject to vehicular or other external loads. 
(5)  The size, slope, alignment and materials used in the construction of a building sewer, and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing, testing, and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the requirements of the local and state building and plumbing codes and other applicable rules and regulations of the city. 
(6)  All costs and expenses incidental to the installation and connection of the building sewer shall be borne by the owner(s). The owner(s) shall indemnify the city for any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the building sewer. Fees for connection shall be as established by the city. 
(7)  The owner shall ensure that all excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the city. 
(8)  In all buildings in which any sanitary facility drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the same building sewer. Drain pipe and sump for collection of such sanitary drainage shall be above the basement floor or in a separately watertight or drained sump or channel. 
(9)  The building sewer shall be connected into the public sewer at the easement or property line. Where no properly located service branch is available, an authorized agent of the city shall cut a neat hole into the main line of the public sewer and a suitable wye or tree saddle [shall be] installed to receive the building sewer. The invert of the building sewer at such point of connection with a saddle shall be in the upper quadrant to the main line of the public sewer. A neat workmanlike connection, not extending past the inner surface of the public sewer, shall be made and the saddle made secure and watertight by encasement in epoxy cement specially prepared for this purpose. A ninety-degree, six-inch tee shall be installed at the property line between the public sewer and the building sewer. This fitting shall serve the purpose of a cleanout and for applying the smoke test during inspection of the line. After testing, a PVC or ductile iron riser will be inserted in this fitting and brought flush with the ground surface. A threaded brass plug shall seal this riser against the intrusion of ground or surface water. 
(10)  All building sanitary sewer lines will be installed so as to meet or exceed the most current revision of the State Plumbing Code. 
(11)  All persons working on sewers with a cleaning rod must use an approved type rod in cleaning sewer connections to city sewers. 
(12)  Sewer taps shall not be allowed for structures where the lowest floor to be connected to the sewer is below the elevation of the nearest existing downstream manhole rim. 
(13)  Property owners shall be responsible for maintaining sewer laterals, including sewer taps, from the building plumbing to the main sewer lines, unless a suitable cleanout is provided at the property or easement line. Where a cleanout is provided at or near the property or easement line, the city will assume responsibility for maintenance of the lateral from the cleanout to the main sewer. 
(14)  New connections to the sewer lines, including sewer taps, shall include a six-inch diameter cleanout at the property line, right-of-way line, or easement line that is readily accessible for sewer maintenance. 
(15)  Repairs to existing sewer lines, whether performed by HWU or by the property owner, shall include the addition of a six-inch diameter cleanout where none existed before or where a four-inch diameter cleanout existed before. 
(d)  Inspection. 
(1)  The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify HWU when the building sewer is ready for connection to the public sewer. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the general manager or his designee. The connections shall be made gastight and watertight and verified by proper testing. 
(2)  All building sewers shall be tested according to State Plumbing Law, Regulations and Code, issued by the Department of Housing, Building, and Construction. 
(Ord. No. 06-11, 3-22-11; Ord. No. 20-14, 6-24-14) 
Sec. 23-30. - Pollutant discharge limits. 
(a)  General conditions. The following described substances, materials, waters or wastes shall be limited in discharges to the Henderson sanitary sewer system to concentrations or quantities which: (i) will not harm either the sewers, wastewater treatment processes or equipment, (ii) will maintain and protect water quality in the receiving stream, and (iii) will not otherwise endanger lives, limb, public property, or constitute a nuisance. The general manager or his designee may set additional limitations or limitations more stringent than those established in the provisions of this ordinance, if in his opinion more severe limitations are necessary to meet the above objectives. In forming his opinion as to the acceptability of a discharge, the general manager or his designee shall give consideration to such factors as the quantity of subject waste in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, the wastewater treatment process employed, capacity of the wastewater treatment plant, and other pertinent factors. 
(b)  Restricted discharges. 
(1)  Wastewater containing more than fifty (50) milligrams per liter of petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oils, or products of mineral oil origin. 
(2)  Wastewater containing floatable oils, fat, or grease, whether emulsified or not, in excess of one hundred fifty (150) milligrams per liter (mg/l) or containing substances which may solidify or become viscous at temperatures between 32º-150ºF (0º-65ºC). 
(3)  Any garbage that has not been properly shredded. Garbage grinders may be connected to sanitary sewers from homes, motels, institutions, restaurants, hospitals, catering establishments, or similar places where garbage originates from the preparation of food in kitchens for the purpose of consumption on the premises or when served by caterers. Ground paper products such as cups, dishes, napkins, and milk containers shall not be discharged to the sewer system. 
(4)  Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity or quantities, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants which injure or interfere with any wastewater treatment processes, constituted a hazard to humans or animals, causes the city to violate the terms of its KPDES permit, prevents the use of acceptable sludge disposal methods, or exceed a limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. 
(5)  Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the city in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations. 
(6)  Any water or wastes which by interaction with other water or wastes in the public sewer system, release noxious gases, form suspended solids which interfere with the collection system, or create a condition deleterious to structures and treatment processes. 
(7)  Any wastewater with objectionable color which cannot be removed to an acceptable level within the operation of the wastewater treatment process unless otherwise specifically noted in the industrial user permit (IUP). 
(8)  Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment processes employed to the extent required by the city's NPDES/KPDES permit. 
(9)  Any waste(s) or wastewater(s) classified as a hazardous waste by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) without a sixty-day prior notification of such discharge to the general manager. This notification must include the name of the hazardous waste, the EPA hazardous waste number, type of discharge, volume/mass of discharge and time of occurrence(s). The general manager may prohibit or condition the discharge(s) at any time. 
(10)  Any water or wastes which have characteristics based on a twenty-four-hour composite sample, grab or a shorter period composite sample, if more representative, that exceed the following normal maximum domestic wastewater parameter concentrations: 
Table 1 
Normal Maximum Domestic Wastewater Concentrations 
Henderson North and South POTWs 
City of Henderson, Kentucky Parameter Maximum allowable concentration without surcharge fee assessment (mg/l) BOD 400 COD 800 TSS 400 NH 3 -N 50 Oil and grease (total) 150  
Any person discharging wastewater exceeding the allowable concentrations as noted in table 1, will be subject to a surcharge fee for each pound loading over and above the allowable concentration. Any other amenable constituents requiring the addition of specific chemicals for proper treatment will also be subject to surcharge as noted on the industrial user permit. Exceedance of the effluent limits specified in table 1 shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of a permit condition or this ordinance if the appropriate surcharge fee is paid and the discharge does not cause interference or pass through to the POTW. 
(11)  The discharge limitations as established in tables 2 and 3 are for characteristics of any wastewaters to be discharged into the municipal sewer system, to the north and south wastewater treatment plants (POTWs), subject to any compliance schedule as must comply with these limitations where they are more stringent than applicable state and/or federal regulations. Based upon the sampling program at the Henderson wastewater treatment plants, the discharge limitations given in tables 2 and 3 may be adjusted to reflect the POTW's needs. The city shall give public notice when any change results in a limitation less stringent than currently exists.

(c)  Dilution of wastewater discharge. No user shall ever increase the use of process water or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the federal categorical pretreatment standards, or in any pollutant specific limitation developed by the city or state. 
(d)  Grease, oil, and sand interceptors. 
(1)  Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be installed when, in the opinion of the general manager or his designee, they are deemed necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing any type of floatable grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of type and capacity approved by the general manager or his designee and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for inspection by HWU staff. 
(2)  The design and capacity of the interceptor shall be the responsibility of the owner(s); however the general manager or his designee must approve the unit. The HWU collection system must be provided adequate protection from prohibited substances traveling through the sewer line(s). 
(3)  No user shall discharge to the POTW any solid or viscous pollutants in amounts which could cause obstruction to the flow in the sewers, or cause interference with the operation of, or cause damage to the POTW, including grease or other materials which may coat or clog a sewer line or appurtenances. 
(4)  Users shall periodically examine their interceptors and update the interceptor if there is evidence of the unit being too small, worn, broken, or otherwise no longer functioning properly. 
(5)  The city may require the interceptor to be cleaned on a more frequent basis if there is evidence of problems occurring, such as due to grease buildup, occurring in the sewer line(s). The city may require reporting of such information for review on a regular basis. 
(6)  In the maintaining of an interceptor, the owner(s) shall be responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means of the captured material and shall maintain records of the dates, and means of disposal for a period of not less than three (3) years. The city reserves the right to recover any costs associated with cleanup in the collection system from the owner(s) of the interceptor due to failure of the unit for any reason. 
(7)  Any removal and hauling of the collected materials not performed by owner(s) personnel must be performed by currently licensed disposal firms. Interceptors shall also comply with the applicable regulations of any other local, state or federal agency having jurisdiction. 
(e)  Floor drains. Floor drains are prohibited unless the following conditions exist: 
(1)  If the business is an existing user and floor drains are already present in the facility, every precaution and safeguard will be expected from the facility to protect the POTW from slugs, spills, negligence, etc. This includes all users, not just those participating in the HWU pretreatment program. The general manager or his designee may inspect the floor drains at any time. The general manager or his designee may request that the drains be sealed in cases where there is a potential harm to the POTW. 
(2)  Permission from the general manager or his designee must be granted before floor drains may be installed on new construction or renovation projects. 
(3)  If floor drains are allowed by the general manager or his designee, an interceptor must accompany them to provide protection to the POTW from petroleum-based products and flammable liquid wastes.

(5)  It shall be illegal to discharge any batch liquid waste into any manhole or other part of the public sewer system, or any building sewer or other facility that discharges to the public sewer system, except at designated points of discharge specified by the general manager, or his designee, for such purpose. 
(6)  Any liquid waste hauler illegally discharging to the public sewer system or discharging wastewater not authorized in the permit shall be subject to immediate revocation of discharge privileges and further subject to the penalties and enforcement actions prescribed in section 23-35, including fines and imprisonment. A suspended permittee shall immediately cease discharging any wastes to the sanitary sewer system of the city or to facilities that discharge directly or indirectly into its system. Should a suspended permittee fail to voluntarily comply with any suspension order, the general manager or his designee shall take such actions as are deemed necessary or appropriate to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW and/or to protect the health and welfare of the general public. 
(7)  A suspended permit may be reinstated by the general manager upon submission of assurances satisfactory to the general manager that the suspended permittee will comply with this division and the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to this section plus payments of such fines or other penalties as may be levied by the HWU. The general manager or his designee shall require that within fifteen (15) days after the date of any such occurrence, the suspended permittee submit a written report to the HWU detailing the nature and extent of the violation(s), including any nonpermitted discharges, and the measures taken by the suspended permittee to prevent any future occurrence. 
(8)  Waste haulers who have been granted permission to discharge to the public sewer system shall pay fees for such discharge in accordance with a fee schedule established by the general manager and approved by the city. The Henderson Water and Sewer Commission shall establish, and from time to time may alter, a schedule of fees, rates and charges for the domestic hauler's discharge permit to cover the costs of treatment and disposal of all wastes governing permit issuance, requirements, conditions, suspensions and all other matters necessary or appropriate to implement this section. 
(9)  Only wastes approved by the general manager or his designee and originating from within the City of Henderson, Henderson County, or Webster County shall be allowed under this permit. Dumping hours shall be fixed by HWU and shall be limited to 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., local time, Monday through Saturday, excluding HWU holidays. Dumping after hours or on holidays may be allowed by permission only from the operator on duty at the HWU wastewater treatment plant. 
(10)  The permittee shall complete a load report for each load of waste deposited into the city's sewer system. The information on the load report shall be recorded and signed by an employee of the permittee, or the permittee himself, and shall be in duplicate on forms furnished by the HWU. The original copy of all load reports, a summary monthly report and accompanying payment based upon the current rate per one thousand (1,000) gallons of approved liquid waste plus the current rate per one thousand (1,000) gallons for contents from grease traps which were discharged into the city's dry bed system for the previous month, shall be submitted to the HWU's administrative office or its designee by the fifteenth day of the month following the discharge. 
(11)  Discharge of all liquid wastes allowed under this section shall take place only at the location(s) designated by the general manager or his designee. The designated location to be used under the domestic hauler's discharge permits may be changed by the general manager or his designee as deemed necessary. 
(12)  The discharge of trucked and/or hauled wastes from industrial plating processes or radiator businesses is prohibited. 
(13)  Nothing in this division shall relieve waste haulers of the responsibility for compliance with Henderson County Health Department, state, or federal regulations. 
(h)  Protection from accidental and slug discharges. 
(1)  [Accidental and/or slug discharges.] Each significant industrial user shall provide protection from accidental and/or slug discharges of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this division which adversely affects the POTW. Facilities to prevent accidental and/or slug discharges of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner or user's own cost and expense. Periodically, the general manager or his designee will determine whether each industrial user needs to develop or update a plan to control slug discharges.

(14)  The permit may require the user to incorporate best management practices (BMPs) that are required by a categorical standard, and to report on compliance with BMP-based categorical standards; 
(15)  Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the city to ensure compliance with this division. 
(e)  Alternative discharge limits. 
(1)  Where an effluent from a categorical industrial process is mixed prior to treatment with wastewater other than that generated by the regulated process, fixed alternative discharge limits may be derived for the discharge permit by the general manager. These alternative limits shall be applied to the mixed effluent and shall be calculated using the combined wastestream formula and/or flow-weighted average formula as defined in section 23-26. 
(2)  Where the effluent limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutants per unit of production (production-based standards), the general manager or his designee may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or of effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent permit limitations applicable to the permittee. The permittee shall be subject to all permit limits calculated in this manner under 40 CFR 403.6(c) and must fully comply with these alternative limits. 
(3)  All categorical users subject to production-based standards must report production rates annually so that alternative permit limits can be calculated if necessary. The categorical industrial user must notify the general manager or his designee thirty (30) days in advance of any major change in production levels that may affect the limits for the discharge permit. 
(f)  Permit duration. Industrial user permits shall be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed five (5) years for a categorical user, and not to exceed three (3) years for a significant user. Temporary permits may be issued for any new categorical user to allow data gathering to determine strength and characteristics of the user's effluent quality. A permit may be issued for a period of less than one (1) year or may be stated to expire on a specific date. The user shall apply for permit reissuance a minimum of sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the user's existing permit. The terms and conditions of the permit may be subject to modification by the city during the term of the permit as limitations or requirements as identified in section 23-30 are modified or other just cause exists. The industrial user shall be informed of any proposed changes in its permit at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of change. Any changes or new conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance. 
(g)  Permit transfer. Industrial user permits are issued to a specific user for a specific operation. An industrial user permit shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new owner, new user, different premises, or a new or changed operation without a thirty (30) day prior notification to the general manager or his designee and provision of a copy of the existing permit to the new owner. The general manager or his designee may deny the transfer of the permit if deemed necessary. 
(h)  Compliance date reporting. Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new user, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to federal categorical pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the general manager or his designee a report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process which are limited by categorical pretreatment standards and requirements and the average and maximum daily flows for the process units in the user's facility which are limited by such categorical pretreatment standards or requirements. The report shall state whether the applicable categorical pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional pretreatment and time schedule is necessary to bring the user into compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standards or requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the user. 
(i)  Periodic compliance reports. 
(1)  All significant industrial users shall submit to the general manager or his designee at least once every six (6) months or on dates specified in the industrial user permit, a report indicating, at a minimum, the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by pretreatment standards or the discharge permit. In addition, this report shall include a record of all daily flows which during the reporting period exceeded the average daily flow. At the discretion of the general manager and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the pretreatment coordinator may agree to alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted. 
(2)  All analyses shall be performed by a laboratory acceptable to the city. Analytical procedures shall be in accordance with procedures established by the U.S. EPA administrator pursuant to Section 304 (g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR 136 and amendments thereto and 40 CFR 261 or with any other test procedures approved by the U.S. EPA administrator. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the U.S. EPA administrator, and shall follow the sampling requirements of 40 CFR 403.12(e) and (h). Non-categorical and categorical SIUs shall report all monitoring results. 
(3)  Where 40 CFR 136 does not include a sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant(s) in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication, "Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants," April 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the U.S. EPA administrator. 
(4)  A wastewater application (WA) must be submitted to the pretreatment coordinator by all categorical industrial users at least ninety (90) days prior to initiation of discharge to the sanitary sewer. The WA must contain, at a minimum, the following: 
a.  Production data: A process description, SIC code number, raw materials used, chemicals used, final product, pretreatment industrial category (if applicable), and a schematic which indicates points of discharge to the sewer system. 
b.  Identifying information to include name, address of facility, owner(s), contact person and any other permits held by the facility. 
c.  Wastewater characteristics: Total plant flow, types of discharges, average and maximum flows from each process. 
d.  Nature/concentration of pollutants: Analytical results for all pollutants regulated by this division and/or any applicable federal pretreatment standard and sample type and location. All analyses must conform to 40 CFR 136 and amendments thereto. 
e.  Information concerning any pretreatment equipment used to treat the facility's discharge. 
(5)  New sources shall give estimates of the information requested in subsections c. and d. above, but at no time shall a new source commence discharge(s) to the public sewer of substances that do not meet all provisions of this division. All new sources must be in compliance with all provisions of this division and state and federal pretreatment regulations prior to commencement of discharge to the public sewer. 
(j)  Permit violations. 
(1)  All significant industrial users must notify the pretreatment coordinator within twenty-four (24) hours of first becoming aware of a permit violation. This notification shall include the date of violation, the parameter violated and the amount in exceedance. 
(2)  The user shall immediately repeat the sampling and analysis of the parameter(s) in question and submit the results of this resampling to the pretreatment coordinator within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violation. Exception to this regulation is only if the city performs the sampling within the same time-period for the same parameter(s) in question. 
(3)  Compliance with the terms of an industrial user permit shall be deemed compliance with the terms of this division. 
(k)  Monitoring. 
(1)  The city may require significant industrial users to provide and operate, at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage system. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in a public right-of-way. The general manager shall review and approve the location, plans, and specifications for such monitoring facilities and may require them to be constructed to provide for the separate monitoring and sampling of industrial waste and sanitary sewage flows. 
(2)  There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility shall be designed and maintained in a manner such that the safety of city and user personnel shall be foremost. The monitoring facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a proper operating condition at the expense of the significant industrial user. 
(3)  Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed within ninety (90) days following approval of the location, plans and specifications. 
(4)  All sampling analyses done in accordance with approved federal EPA procedures by the industrial user during a reporting period shall be submitted to the pretreatment coordinator, regardless of whether or not the analyses were required by the significant industrial user's discharge permit. All users shall provide representative samples in their periodic monitoring reports. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(5)  A significant industrial user must receive the approval of the pretreatment coordinator before changing the sampling point and/or monitoring facilities to be used in all required sampling. Industrial users shall sample only at the sampling point. HWU may sample at other locations in order to establish compliance by the user. 
(6)  Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis, based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the applicable reporting period. 
a.  Except as indicated in b. and c. below, the user shall collect wastewater samples using twenty-four-hour flow-proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite or grab sampling is authorized by the pretreatment coordinator. Where time-proportional or grab sampling is authorized, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate US EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides, the samples may be composited in the field or in the laboratory; for volatile organics, and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits. 
b.  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab sampling techniques. 
c.  For samples required in support of baseline monitoring and ninety-day compliance reports, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and organic compounds. For facilities where historical sampling is available, the pretreatment coordinator may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by subsection 23-31 (i), the user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(l)  Inspection and sampling. 
(1)  The city shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purposes of this division are being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the general manager or his designee ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, copying records, records examination or in the performance of any of their duties. 
(2)  HWU, approval authority, and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspections, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city, approval authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. 
(m)  Pretreatment. All significant industrial users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this division and achieve compliance with any applicable federal categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. The general manager may require the development of a compliance schedule for installation of pretreatment technology and/or equipment by any industrial user that cannot meet the discharge limits required by this division. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level required by this division shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the general manager and pretreatment coordinator for review, and shall be acceptable to the general manager before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent that complies with the provisions of this division. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the general manager or his designee prior to the user's initiation of the changes. 
(n)  Annual publication. 
(1)  The city shall annually publish in a newspaper of local circulation a list of significant industrial users which were in significant noncompliance with any pretreatment requirements or standards during the previous twelve (12) months. The notification shall also summarize any enforcement actions taken against the user(s) during the same twelve (12) months. The costs to the city resulting from such publication shall be borne on a proportional basis by the significant industrial users published. 
(2)  All records relating to the city's pretreatment program shall be made available to officials of the EPA or approval authority upon request. All records shall be maintained for a minimum of three (3) years in accordance with 40 CFR 403.12 (O) (2). 
(o)  Significant noncompliance. A user is defined as being in significant noncompliance when it commits one (1) or more of the following actions:

(Ord. No. 06-11, 3-22-11) 
Sec. 23-34. - Enforcement. 
(a)  General. 
(1)  The city, through the general manager or his designee, to insure compliance with this chapter, and as permitted through 40 CFR subchapter N, and 401 KAR 5:055, may take the following enforcement steps against users in noncompliance with the ordinance. The remedies available to the POTW include injunctive relief, civil and criminal penalties, immediate discontinuance of discharges and/or water service and the publishing of a list of significant industrial users in significant noncompliance annually. The enforcement authority shall be vested in the general manager or his/her designee. 
(2)  The general manager may suspend wastewater treatment service, an industrial user permit, MS4 service, and/or a domestic hauler's discharge permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the general manager, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes interference to the POTW or causes the city to violate any condition of its NPDES/KPDES permit. 
(3)  Any user notified of a suspension of wastewater treatment service, its industrial user permit, MS4 service, and/or its domestic hauler's discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city shall take such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, the collection system, the MS4, and/or endangerment to any individuals. Severance of connection to the MS4 may require the MS4 user to obtain a separate stormwater permit. The city shall reinstate the industrial user permit, wastewater treatment service, MS4 service, and/or the domestic hauler's discharge permit upon receiving proof of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the city's pretreatment coordinator within fifteen (15) days of the date of occurrence. 
(4)  In the event of termination of service, the sewer user, MS4 user or significant industrial user shall pay the HWU for all costs incurred to perform the disconnection and reconnection of service plus fifteen (15) percent administrative costs prior to the service being restored. If actual costs cannot be determined, the costs shall be estimated by the general manager. 
(b)  Notice of violation. 
(1)  Any user found to be violating any provisions of this division, an industrial user permit, or any order issued hereunder, shall be served by the city with written or verbal notice of violation (NOV) stating the nature of the violation(s) and requiring correction of the violation within a time limit as determined by the general manager. Within the specific time limit set by said notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted to the general manager. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of potential liability for any violation occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. 
(2)  If the violations persist or the explanation and/or plan are not adequate, the city's response shall be more formal and commitments (or schedules as appropriate) for compliance will be established in an administrative order. The enforcement response selected will be related to the seriousness of the violation. Enforcement responses will be escalated if compliance is not achieved expeditiously after the initial action. Enforcement actions may require without limitation: 
a.  The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting; 
b.  The elimination of illicit connections or discharges; 
c.  That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and desist; 
d.  The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property; 
e.  Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs, as well as punitive assessments; and 
f.  The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs. 
Identification of significant noncompliance as defined in subsection 23-31(o), will require a formal enforcement action. 
(3)  The full scale of enforcement actions will be as detailed in the HWU enforcement response plan. 
(c)  Appeal of notice of violation. Any person receiving a notice of violation (NOV) may appeal the determination of the authorized enforcement officer. The notice of appeal must be received within five (5) days from the date of the notice of violation. Hearing on the appeal before the general manager or his/her designee shall take place within fifteen (15) days from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal. The decision of the general manager or his designee shall be final. 
(d)  Enforcement measures after appeal. If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within fifteen (15) days of the decision of the general manager upholding the decision of the authorized enforcement officer, then the authorized enforcement officer shall enter upon the subject private property and are authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the Henderson Water Utility or designated contractor to enter upon the premises for the purposes set forth above. 
(e)  Cost of abatement of the violation. After abatement of the violation, the owner of the property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the assessment within fifteen (15) days. If the amount due is not paid within a timely manner as determined by the decision of the municipal authority or by the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment. 
(f)  Administrative orders. 
(1)  Any user who after receiving a notice of violation shall continue to discharge in violation of this division or other pretreatment standards or requirements or is determined to be in significant noncompliance shall be ordered to appear before the general manager. At said appearance, a compliance schedule will be given to the noncompliant user and an administrative fine may be assessed. The fine shall be determined on a case-by-case basis which shall consider the type and severity of the violation(s), duration of violation(s), number of violation(s), severity of impact on the POTW, impact on human health, user's economic benefit from the violation(s), history of violation(s), and good faith of the user, and shall be a nonarbitrary but appropriate amount. 
(2)  Users desiring to dispute such fines shall file with the general manager a request for the municipal water and sewer commission to reconsider the fine. This appeal must be filed within ten (10) days of the date of being notified of the fine. The Henderson Water and Sewer Commission shall convene a hearing on the matter within fifteen (15) days of receiving such a request from the user. The decision of the Henderson Water and Sewer Commission shall be final. 
(3)  The administrative order may take any of the following three (3) forms: 
a.  Consent orders. The general manager or his/her designee is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with the industrial user responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will include specific actions to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order. Consent orders shall have the same force and effect as orders issued pursuant to subsection (f)(3)b. below. 
b.  Compliance orders. When the general manager or his designee finds that a user has violated or continues to violate this division or a permit or order issued hereunder, he may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, sewer service, water service, or MS4 access shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances and equipment have been installed and are properly operated. Compliance orders may also contain such other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring, and management practices. 
c.  Cease and desist orders. When the general manager finds that a user has violated or continues to violate this division or any permit or order issued hereunder, the general manager may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and direct the user in noncompliance to:

2.  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and terminating the discharge. 
(g)  Show cause hearing. 
(1)  The general manager or his designee may issue to any user who causes or contributes to violations of this division, or permit or order issued hereunder, an order to appear and show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the general manager regarding the violation, the reasons why the action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the user to show cause, before the general manager, why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days before the hearing. Service may be made on any authorized representative of the user. Whether or not a duly notified user or its authorized representative appears, immediate enforcement action may be pursued by the general manager. 
(2)  The general manager may, himself, conduct the hearing and take the evidence, or designate a representative to: 
a.  Issue, in the name of the city, notices of hearings requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearing; 
b.  Take the evidence; and 
c.  Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including transcripts, recordings and other evidence, together with recommendations to the general manager for action thereon. 
(3)  At any hearing held pursuant to this division, testimony taken must be under oath and recorded electronically. This recording will be made available to any member of the public or any party to the hearing upon payment of the usual charges thereof. 
(4)  After the city has reviewed the evidence, it may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that, following a specified time period, the sewer service will be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are properly installed and operated. Further orders and directives as are necessary and appropriate may be issued. 
(h)  Additional enforcement remedies. 
(1)  Performance bonds. The general manager may decline to reissue a permit to any user which has failed to comply with the provisions of this division or any order or previous permit issued hereunder unless such user first files with HWU a satisfactory bond, payable to HWU, in a sum not to exceed a value determined by the general manager to be necessary to achieve consistent compliance. 
(2)  Liability insurance. The general manager may decline to reissue a permit to any user which has failed to comply with the provisions of this division or any order or previous permit issued hereunder, unless such user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient to restore or repair POTW damage caused by its discharge.

DIVISION 4. - WATER SUPPLY SHORTAGE RESPONSE 

Sec. 23-45.11. - Declaration of water supply shortage; rationing. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide for the declaration of phases of water supply shortages and for the implementation of voluntary and mandatory water conservation measures affecting the water customers of the city in the event a shortage is declared. 
(b)  Definitions. As used in this section, the following words and terms shall have the following meanings: 
(1)  Customer . Any person using water for any purpose from the city's water distribution system. 
(2)  HWU . The Henderson Water Utility. 
(3)  Outside water use . Nonessential uses of water outside of buildings, including, but not limited to: filling and operation of private swimming pools, water features, fountains and reflecting pools; noncommercial washing of motor vehicles, boats and trailers; and watering of lawns, gardens, playing fields and recreational areas, whether public or private. 
(4)  Rationing . Procedures established to provide for the fair distribution of critically limited water supplies, in order to balance demand and supply, and to assure that sufficient water is available to preserve public health and safety. 
(c)  Water shortage phases . In order of increasing severity the following four (4) phases of water shortage are hereby established: 
(1)  Phase 1, advisory. When HWU finds that a potential shortage of potable water exists or will exist, HWU shall publicly declare a water shortage advisory, calling upon all customers of HWU to employ voluntary water conservation and to reduce the use of potable water. 
(2)  Phase 2, alert. When HWU finds that a condition exists where it will not be able to meet the expected needs of its customers for water without a minimal level of water conservation, HWU shall publicly declare a water shortage alert, calling upon all customers to employ voluntary water conservation, and also to restrict outside water use to the following schedule: 
i.  Outside water use for addresses ending in an odd number shall be limited to Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays; and 
ii.  Outside water use for addresses ending in an even number shall be limited to Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays. 
(3)  Phase 3, emergency. When HWU finds that it is unable to meet the expected needs of its customers, HWU shall publicly declare a water shortage emergency, calling upon customers to comply with mandatory water conservation to eliminate the waste of potable water. All outside water use shall be halted, and water shall be used only as necessary to sustain human life and the lives of domestic pets, to maintain minimum standards of hygiene and sanitation, to provide patient care and rehabilitation in health care facilities, for firefighting, and for essential health and public protection purposes. 
(4)  Phase 4, rationing. When HWU finds that potable water is in critically short supply, and that the conditions specified in subsection (d) below are determined to exist, HWU shall publicly declare water rationing. In the rationing phase, it is imperative that water customers achieve an immediate further reduction in water use in order to extend existing water supplies and, at the same time, assure that sufficient water is available to preserve the public health and sanitation and to provide fire protection service. The mandatory water conservation measures of the emergency phase shall apply, and in addition, HWU may institute temporary service interruptions to all or portions of the water supply system. 
(5)  Length of continuance of declaration. The declaration of a water shortage phase shall continue until HWU finds and publicly declares that the conditions calling for the declaration no longer exist. 
(d)  Basis for rationing. Whenever HWU finds it necessary to allocate critically limited potable water supplies in order to balance water demand and supply, and to assure that sufficient water is available to preserve public health and safety, it shall be empowered to declare the adoption of mandatory rationing, when any of the following conditions is determined to exist: 
(1)  Mandated reductions in systemwide usage have not been achieved; or 
(2)  Mandated reductions in systemwide water usage have been achieved, but have failed to sufficiently extend limited water supplies; or 
(3)  Temporary service interruptions are necessary in order to further extend limited water supplies. 
(e)  Notification. When it is determined that rationing through temporary service interruptions is necessary, HWU shall notify its customers through the public media (newspapers, radio, and television), at least one (1) day prior to the temporary service interruptions that a planned, temporary service interruption is to be imposed. Such notice shall: 
(1)  State the day or days when the temporary service interruptions will occur, including the times when such temporary service interruptions will commence and cease; 
(2)  State whether the temporary service interruptions are to be imposed on the entire system or part thereof, and, if only parts of the system will experience temporary service interruptions, identify geographic boundaries within which such interruptions will occur; and, 
(3)  Advise all customers within the areas affected by temporary service interruptions how to treat any water received from the system for human consumption, during the period of such interruptions and for such additional time as may be necessary until full pressure and water quality is restored in the system. 
(f)  Rationing for hospital facilities. If a temporary service interruption is imposed as authorized by this section, it must provide for the continued delivery of water to hospital facilities within the area affected by such interruption by means of any adequate, alternative delivery measures that may be necessary. 
(g)  Regulations. During the effective period of any water supply shortage, the HWU general manager is empowered to issue such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section. Such regulations shall be subject to the approval of the city water and sewer commission at its next meeting. 
(h)  Violations. Any person who violates the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall be subject to a fine not to exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00). Any person who violates the provisions of paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall be subject to a fine not to exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) and disconnection of water service.

Sec. 23-98. - Water and sewer charges. 
(a)  Special rates: 
(1)  If the wastewater or other liquid wastes being discharged into the sewers from any building or premises is determined by HWU to contain unduly high concentrations of any substances which add to the operating cost of the sewer facilities of HWU, HWU may establish special rates or charges as to such class of building or premises, or HWU may require the owner or other interested party to specially treat such sewage, water or other liquid wastes before it is discharged into the sewers. 
(2)  HWU may establish rules and regulations regarding the use of the sewer facilities which may control the amount and characteristics of wastes permitted to be discharged therein where such quantities or characteristics may be injurious to the works or deleterious to their operation. 
(b)  Application for special classification. Whenever it is determined by HWU to be necessary to classify any commercial institutions or industries by reason of the unusual purpose for which water is used or the character of the wastewater or other liquid wastes discharged therefrom, or whenever the foregoing schedules or charges for any reason are not applicable, then HWU may establish special rates or other charges, and any person, being charged the foregoing rates and being dissatisfied therewith by reason of peculiar or unusual use or occupancy of any premises and consequently alleging peculiar or unusual uses of water, may file application with HWU for special classification, rates or charges. 
(c)  Authority to revise rates. The rates or charges shall be revised from time to time as may be necessary in order that the city may comply with the covenants and undertakings securing the water and sewer revenue bonds of the city. 
(d)  No free sewer service. No free use of the services and facilities of the sanitary sewers shall be granted or permitted to any sewer user, excepting the city itself. 
(e)  Provision of water and wastewater service, rates and charges outside city. There shall be monthly rates and charges for water and/or wastewater services rendered by HWU to customers and users outside the corporate limits of the city. The city owes no obligation to make water or wastewater service available to property located outside its corporate limits, and does not offer water or wastewater services to such property except under the following conditions: 
(1)  Where such property is adjacent to or within reasonable distance of a water or wastewater main or line in the service area of HWU's water or wastewater plants, the owner of such property may make written application to the water and sewer commission for the privilege of connecting to such water and/or wastewater main or line. The application shall include a properly executed and notarized form consenting to annexation and the provision of water and/or wastewater service shall be conditioned on the execution of a deed restriction for the property to be served not to oppose annexation. If, in the sole discretion of the water and sewer commission (each case to be judged on its own merits) such connection can be accommodated without exceeding the capacity of the main or line in question or causing other problems in the distribution, collection, or treatment systems and will be beneficial to the public health and welfare of the area, the water and sewer commission may approve the application subject to formal acceptance by the board of commissioners. 
(2)  Where an existing private or publicly owned wastewater system is to be taken over in whole or in part by HWU, such system can be accepted following written application to and approval by the water and sewer commission and formal acceptance by the board of commissioners. 
(3)  Where an existing private or publicly owned wastewater system desires to contract with HWU for wastewater services such contractual arrangements can be accepted following written application to and approval by the water and sewer commission and formal acceptance by the board of commissioners.

(b)  Interest will accrue on all deposits at the rate prescribed by KRS 278.460 beginning on the date of the deposit. Interest accrued will be refunded to the customer or credited to the customer's bill on an annual basis.

Such interest shall not be compounded. 
(c)  All interest accruing on such cash deposits shall be paid annually at the conclusion of the fiscal year of the city or the utility commission, as the case may be, by crediting to and deducting from the depositor's next succeeding utility bill a sum equal to such unpaid accrued interest. The first such payment of all unpaid accrued interest by credit shall be made at the conclusion of the 1983-84 fiscal year and annually thereafter. 
(d)  The cash deposit of depositors voluntarily terminating utility service shall be refunded with accrued interest, computed in the manner stated herein, in cash, to the extent such deposit and accrued interest exceeds the final unpaid utility bill of such depositor. 
(e)  Notwithstanding the requirement of subsection (a), a deposit will not be required for real estate being sold under a contract of sale or under a deed with a purchase money lien retained by the seller, if both the seller and buyer sign documents required by the city that will bind both the seller and buyer to the city for the payment for all gas and/or electricity used. 
(f)  In lieu of the requirement of subsection (a), all residential or commercial tenants may post with the city a surety bond, to be approved by the director of finance. 
(g)  In lieu of the surety bond required by subsection (f), an owner of real estate who is a user of city utilities and who has not been on the "cut off" list since he or she has been such a user or for the past twenty-four (24) months, may sign as a guarantor for a residential tenant. Such guaranty agreement with the city, shall provide for and shall be subject to the following: 
(1)  If the residential tenant shall fail to pay his or her utility charges within ten (10) days from the date of issuance and mailing of the bill, such bill shall then be mailed to the guarantor. If the guarantor fails to pay said bill within six (6) days from the date of said issuance and mailing to him or her, the service provided by the appropriate utility shall be discontinued in due course to the premises of both the residential tenant and the guarantor and said charges shall be assessed against the guarantor. Service shall not be resumed to the premises of either the residential tenant or the guarantor, where such service has been discontinued for said nonpayment, until all charges, penalty and service charges have been paid in full. 
(2)  If the guarantor ceases to become a user of city utilities, or gives to the city written notice that he or she wants to be removed as guarantor, his or her guaranty agreement with the city shall be terminated within ten (10) days after actual notice thereof is given to tenant. Tenant shall, within said ten-day period, make the required cash deposit, or post the appropriate surety bond, or have a qualified guarantor execute another guaranty agreement on his or her behalf. 
(3)  No person may sign as a guarantor for more than three (3) residential tenant users of city utilities, except with the written consent of the city manager. 
(4)  The provisions of this subsection shall be applied retroactively. Every residential tenant who has previously made the required cash deposit shall, upon the execution of the guaranty agreement required by this subsection, be reimbursed in the amount of such deposit. 
(5)  The city manager may waive the requirement for a utility security deposit by a tenant who is not the owner of the premises when the tenant is financially unable to provide the deposit as a result of emergency conditions beyond the control of the tenant. 
(h)  City may transfer delinquent read out bills of a customer to any other account under the customer's name or Social Security number.

(1)  No acceptance of any payment by the city shall be construed as an accord and satisfaction that the amount paid is in fact the release of any claim that the city may have for further or additional sums payable under this article. 
(2)  Notwithstanding the above, the company shall be required to pay the city an amount intended to adequately compensate it for its permitting and inspection of the company's construction activities in the rights-of-way pursuant to the Code and all attorney's fees that the city may incur relating to the franchising process, including but not limited to any attorneys' fees incurred relating granting of the franchise and any transfer, renewal or modification of the franchise.

(c)  If company locates its above ground facilities where poles or other wire holding structures already existing for use in serving Henderson, Kentucky are available for use by the company, but it does not make arrangements for such use, the city may require the company to use such poles and structures if it determines that the public health, welfare and/or safety would be enhanced thereby. 
(d)  Where the city or a public utility serving the city desires to make use of the poles or other wire holding structures of the company, but agreement thereof with the company cannot be reached, the board of commissioners may require the company to permit such use, if the board of commissioners determines that the use would enhance the public health, welfare and/or safety. 
(e)  If the company uses its own poles or other wire holding structures, the company shall remove or reset (if required for public safety) said poles or other wire holding structures within twelve (12) hours of any said pole or other wire holding structure coming down.

(a)  All districts. The following conditional uses only may be approved in all zoning districts: 
(1)  Utility structures and public service buildings. 
(2)  Government buildings and uses. 
(b)  Specified districts. Other conditional uses may be approved in only those zoning districts where they are specifically designated as conditional uses under the zoning district regulations. 
(c)  Procedure. In applying for a conditional use permit, the applicant shall submit an application to the administrative official and follow all procedures set forth in this section. The administrative official shall refer the application to the board of zoning adjustment. The board of zoning adjustment shall hold a public hearing in accordance with the provisions of KSA Ch. 424 and Ch. 100.237. 
(d)  Action. The board may approve, modify or deny an application for a conditional use permit. If it approves such permit, it may attach necessary conditions such as time limitations requirements that one (1) or more things must be done before such request can be initiated or conditions of a continuing nature. Any such conditions shall be recorded in the board's minutes and on the conditional use permit, along with a reference to the specific section of this chapter listing the conditional use under consideration. The board shall have the power to revoke a conditional use permit for noncompliance with the conditions thereof. Further the board shall have the right of action to compel offending structures or uses removed at the cost of the violator and may have judgment in personam for such costs. 
(e)  Filing. All conditional use permits approved by the board of adjustments shall be kept on file in the office of the code administrator and a certificate of land use restriction shall be recorded by the administrative official of the board of adjustments in the office of the county court clerk at the expense of the applicant. 
(f)  Time limit. In any case where a conditional use permit has not been exercised within the time limit set by the board, or within one (1) year, if no specific time limit has been set, such conditional use permit shall not revert to its original designation unless there has been a public hearing held by the board of zoning adjustment in accordance with KSA Chapter 424 and Chapter 100.237. "Exercised" as set out in this section shall mean that binding contracts for the construction of the main building or other improvements is under construction to a substantial investment, is under contract, in development or completed. When construction is not a part of the use, exercised shall mean that the use is in operation in compliance with the conditions as designated in the permit. 
(g)  Exemptions. Granting of a conditional use permit does not exempt the applicant from complying with all the requirements of building, housing, and other codes and regulations. 
(h)  Review. The administrative official shall review all conditional use permits, except those for which all conditions have been permanently satisfied, at least once annually and shall have the power to inspect the land or structure where the conditional use is located in order to ascertain that the landowner is complying with all of the conditions which are listed on the conditional use permit. If the landowner is not complying with all of the conditions listed on the conditional use permit, the administrative official shall report the fact in writing to the chairman of the board of adjustments. The report shall state specifically the manner in which the landowner is not complying with the conditions on the conditional use permit and a copy of the report shall be furnished to the chairman of the board of adjustments. The board shall hold a hearing on the report within a reasonable time and notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be furnished to the landowner at least one (1) week prior to the hearing. If the board of adjustments finds that the facts alleged in the report of the administrative official are true and that the landowner has taken no steps to comply with them between the date of the report and the date of the hearing, the board may authorize the administrative official to revoke the conditional use permit and take necessary legal action to cause termination of activity on the land which the conditional use permit authorizes. 
(i)  Permanent approval. Once the board of zoning adjustment has completed a conditional use permit and all the conditions required are of such type that they can be completely and permanently satisfied, the administrative official, upon request by the applicant may, if the facts warrant, make a determination that the conditions have been satisfied and enter the facts which indicate that the conditions have been satisfied and the conclusion in the margin of the conditional use permit, which is on file in the office of the code administrator.

iii.  Facade colors, building trim and accent areas, may contrast, and shall be subtle, neutral or earth tone colors. 
(2)  Outlots and auxiliary buildings. The presence of smaller retail stores, restaurants and office buildings gives a center a "friendlier" appearance by creating variety, breaking up large expanses, and expanding the range of the site's activities. All buildings within the development shall meet the following; 
i.  All buildings within the shopping center shall conform to the master building architectural, signage, lighting and landscaping plan prepared by the developer of the primary retail and/or office establishments. A draft of such standards shall be presented to the planning commission as part of the master plan for the project. 
ii.  Sidewalks and pedestrian connections shall be installed between outparcels and the primary uses, and between each outparcel, to enhance internal circulation and create a streetscape experience for pedestrians. 
(3)  Parking. 
i.  Parking areas should provide safe, convenient, and efficient access. Parking areas serve not only vehicular traffic, but pedestrian as well and should be designed to meet the needs of both. 
ii.  All parking shall be located no more than one hundred eighty (180) feet from a pedestrian facility/sidewalk. 
iii.  Parking spaces shall be required at the ratio of eight (8) spaces for the first one thousand (1,000) square feet gross floor area and one (1) space for each additional per two hundred (200) square feet of usable floor area.

vii.  All planting islands will be provided with two (2) two and one-half-inch caliper canopy trees. The remaining area of the parking island shall be planted with vegetation that complements the structure or a suitable groundcover. The dimensions of the parking islands shall be sufficient to support the health of the canopy trees at maturity. 
(4)  Access and loading areas. 
i.  Entrances from any public road, street or highway to the shopping center shall not be located at intervals of less than six hundred sixty (660) lineal feet, unless it is determined that a smaller interval would not be detrimental to the development of the shopping center. 
ii.  Marginal access streets may be required parallel to and adjacent to all public roads, streets and highways and such frontage road shall be not less than forty (40) feet wide, which shall be improved and paved in accordance with accepted standards.

The service drive shall be in addition to and shall not be a part of the drive or circulation system used by the vehicles of customers or shoppers. The arrangement of truck loading and unloading facilities for each shop or business shall be such that in the process of loading and unloading, no truck will block the passage of other vehicles using the service drive or extend into any other private drive, street or avenue or vehicular circulation. 
(5)  Pedestrian flow. 
i.  Pedestrian accessibility opens auto-oriented developments to the neighborhood, reducing traffic impacts and enabling the development to project a friendlier, more inviting image. This section sets forth standards for public sidewalks and internal pedestrian circulation systems that can provide user-friendly pedestrian access as well as pedestrian safety, shelter, and convenience within the center grounds. 
ii.  Pedestrian facilities shall be included in any site plan submitted for review. 
iii.  Sidewalks at least five (5) feet in width shall be provided along all sides of a lot that abuts a public or private right-of-way. 
iv.  Continuous internal pedestrian walkways, no less than five (5) feet in width, shall be provided from the public sidewalk or right-of-way to the principal customer entrance of all buildings on the site. At a minimum, walkways shall connect focal points of pedestrian activity such as, but not limited to, central features and community spaces transit stops, parking areas, street crossings, building and store entry points, and shall feature adjoining landscaped areas that include trees, shrubs, benches, flower beds, ground covers, or other such materials for no less than fifty (50) percent of their length. 
v.  Sidewalks no less than five (5) feet in width, shall be provided along the full length of the building along any facade featuring a customer entrance, and along any facade abutting public parking areas. In instances where arcades are incorporated into the wall, foundation landscaping shall be located outside of the covered area. 
vi.  All internal pedestrian walkways shall be distinguished from driving surfaces through the use of durable, low maintenance surface materials such as pavers, bricks, or scored concrete to enhance pedestrian safety and comfort, as well as the attractiveness of the walkways. 
(6)  Landscaping.

The landscaping shall be composed of mixtures of planting materials. If the building is taller than twenty-five (25) feet the foundation landscaping shall incorporate trees. 
iii.  Exemptions from this requirement may be granted when the following circumstances exist or when any of the following conditions are proposed on the site: 
(a)  Building entrances and exits. 
(b)  Areas used for pedestrian activities (sidewalks, plazas, etc.), in which instances the landscaping must be installed between the building foundation and the back of curb separating the pedestrian area from the vehicle use area. In no case shall the length of the planted area be less than fifty (50) percent of the length of the building facade, minus the width of entrances and exits. A variety of planting beds, street trees and elevated planters may be used. 
(c)  For those portions of buildings which have drive up services along the side of the building (i.e., pharmacies, banks, fast-food, dry-cleaners, photo shops, etc.). 
(d)  Adjacent to truck loading or service areas not open to public parking or on the rear side of a building when less than ten (10) percent of the total required parking is located in the rear of the building and the rear is not adjacent to any public right-of-way.

i.  Detailed lighting plan. The lighting plan shall show the location of all site lighting including lights mounted on buildings that are intended to illuminate spaces adjacent to the building. The lighting plan shall include specifications and details of all fixtures, and a photometric plan. The photometric plan and lighting plan shall be submitted with the site plan. 
ii.  Orientation and shielding. Light fixtures in excess of one hundred (100) watts or two hundred (200) lumens shall use full cut-off lenses or hoods to prevent glare or spillover from the project onto adjacent lands or right-of-way. Standard decorative street lights are exempt. No illumination in excess of one (1) footcandle across any residentially zoned lot line is allowed. The orientation of all lighting shall be downward. 
iii.  Height. Luminary heights shall not exceed twenty-five (25) feet.

v.  Wherever possible, illumination of outdoor seating areas, building entrances, and walkways shall be accomplished by use of ground mounted fixtures not more than four (4) feet in height. 
vi.  Type. Each outdoor luminary shall be a recessed or a full cutoff luminary, and the use of decorative luminaries with full cutoff optics is desired. A full cutoff luminaire is an outdoor light fixture shielded in such a manner that all light emitted by the fixture, either directly from the lamp or indirectly from the fixture is projected below the horizontal plane. 
vii.  Location. All exterior lighting fixtures shall not be located within a required buffer area unless they are located at the interior edge. 
viii.  Hue. Lighting sources shall be color neutral types such as halogen or metal halide. Light types of limited spectral emission such as low-pressure sodium or mercury vapor lights are prohibited. 
ix.  Floodlights and spotlights. Floodlights and spotlights shall be selected, located, aimed, and shielded so that the direct illumination is focused exclusively on a portion of the building facade or other intended site feature and away from adjoining lands or right-of-way. Such lighting shall be installed in a fixture that is shielded so that no portion of the light extends below the bottom edge or above the top edge of the shield and the main beam from the light source is not visible from adjacent lands or the adjacent right-of-way. Floodlights or other type of lighting attached to light poles that illuminate the site and/or buildings are prohibited. 
x.  Prohibited lighting. The following lighting fixtures are prohibited: searchlights, laser source lights, or any similar high-intensity light, except in emergencies by police and fire personnel. 
xi.  Canopy lighting. Lighting installed on canopies or drive-thru facilities are permitted an average footcandle reading of twenty (20) footcandles under any area that is illuminated. Lighting shall use diffusers and be shielded. No light source or lens in a canopy structure shall extend downward further than the lowest edge of the canopy ceiling, unless the fixture is of a full cut-off design. 
xii.  Building lighting. Property owners and managers are encouraged to safely illuminate building entry/exit locations; however, such areas shall only be illuminated using wall mounted lights as described below or off-building lighting that does not generate glare or otherwise allow the light to be viewed directly from off the property. Building walls may be illuminated. 
xiii.  Wall mounted lights. Wall mounted lights shall be fully shielded luminaries to prevent the light source from being visible from any adjacent residential property or public street right-of-way. Nothing in this subsection shall prevent the use of sconces or other decorative lighting fixtures with wattage equal to or less than one hundred fifty (150) watts.

Sec. 5.01. - Powers and duties. 
    The board of zoning adjustment established by Ordinance No. 35-66 passed in 1966, and continued by Ordinance No. 3-70 passed in 1970, and Ordinance No. 35-70 passed in 1970, and Ordinance No. 15-82 passed in 1982, is continued by this ordinance.

When a vacancy occurs other than through expiration of the term of office, it shall be filled for the remainder of the term. All appointments shall continue until the successors shall have qualified. 
(g)  All members of the board of adjustment shall, before entering upon their duties, qualify by taking the oath of office prescribed by Section 228 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Kentucky before any judge, notary public, clerk of a court or justice of the peace within the district or county in which he/she resides. 
(h)  Any member of the board of adjustment may be removed by the appropriate appointing authority for inefficiency, neglect of duty, malfeasance or conflict of interest. Any appointing authority who exercises the power to remove a member of the board of adjustments shall submit a written statement to the commission setting forth the reasons for removal, and the statement shall be read at the next meeting of the board of adjustment which shall be open to the general public. The member so removed shall have the right to appeal from the removal to the circuit court of the county in which he/she resides. 
(i)  The board of adjustment shall annually elect a chairman, vice-chairman and secretary and any other such officers it deems necessary and any officer shall be eligible for reelection at the expiration of his term. 
(j)  The board of adjustment shall conduct meetings at the call of the chairman who shall give written notice or oral notice to all members of the board at least seven (7) days prior to the meeting, which notice shall contain the date, time and place for the meeting and the subjects which will be discussed. 
(k)  A simple majority of the total membership of a board of adjustment as established by regulation or agreement shall constitute a quorum. Any member of the board of adjustment who has any direct or indirect financial interest in the outcome of any question before the body shall disclose the nature of the interest and shall disqualify himself/herself from voting on the questions. 
(l)  The board of adjustment shall adopt bylaws for the transaction of business and shall keep minutes and records of all proceedings including regulations, transactions, findings, and determinations and the number of votes for and against each question, and if any member is absent or abstains from voting, indicating the fact, all of which shall immediately after adoption, be filed in the office of the board. A transcript of the minutes of the board of adjustment meeting shall be provided if requested by a party, at the expense of the requesting party, and the transcript shall constitute the record. 
(m)  The board of adjustment may employ or contract with planners or other persons as it deems necessary to accomplish its assigned duties. 
(n)  The board of adjustment shall have the power to issue subpoena to compel witnesses to attend its meetings and give evidence bearing upon the questions before it. The sheriff shall serve such subpoenas. The circuit court may, upon application by the board, compel obedience to such court or such subpoena by proceedings of contempt. 
(o)  The chairman of the board of adjustments shall have the power to administer an oath to witnesses prior to their testifying before the board on any issue. 
(p)  The board shall have the power to hear and decide applications for conditional use permits to allow the proper integration into the community of uses which are specifically named in the zoning regulations which may be suitable only in specific locations in the zone only if certain conditions are met. 
(1)  The board may approve, modify, or deny any application for a conditional use permit. If it approves such permits it may attach necessary conditions such as time limitations, requirements that one (1) or more things be done before the request can be initiated, or conditions of a continuing nature. Any such conditions shall be recorded in the board's minutes and on the conditional use permit along with a reference to the specific section in the zoning regulation listing the conditional use under consideration. The board shall have the power to revoke conditional use permits or variances for noncompliance with the condition thereof. Furthermore, the board shall have a right of action to compel offending structures or uses removed at the cost of the violator and may have judgment in personam for such cost. 
(2)  Granting of a conditional use permit does not exempt the applicant from complying with all of the requirements of building, housing and other regulations. 
(3)  In any case where a conditional use permit has not been exercised within the time limit set by the board, or within one (1) year, if no specific time limit has been set, such conditional use permit shall not revert back to its original designation unless there has been another public hearing. "Exercised" as set forth in this section shall mean that binding contracts for the construction of the main building or other improvements have been met or, in the absence of contracts, that the main building or other improvement is under construction to a substantial degree, or that prerequisite conditions involving substantial investment, under contract, in development are completed. When construction is not a part of the use, "exercised" shall mean that the use is in operation in compliance with the conditions as set forth in the permit. 
(4)  The administrative official shall review all conditional use permits except those for which all conditions have been permanently satisfied, at least once annually and shall have the power to inspect the land or structure where the conditional use is located in order to ascertain that the landowner is complying with all of the conditions listed on the conditional use permit. If the landowner is not complying with all of the conditions listed on the conditional use permit, the administrative official shall report the fact in writing to the chairman of the board of adjustments. The report shall state specifically the manner in which the landowner is not complying with the conditions on the conditional use permit, and a copy of the report shall be furnished to the landowner at the same time it is furnished to the chairman of the board of adjustments. The board shall hold a hearing on the report within a reasonable time and notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be furnished to the landowner at least one (1) week prior to the hearing. If the board of adjustments finds that the facts alleged in the report of the administrative official are true and that the landowner has taken no steps to comply with them between the date of the report and the date of the hearing, the board of adjustments may authorize the administrative official to revoke the conditional use permit and take the necessary legal action to cause the termination of the activity on the land which the conditional use permit authorizes. 
(5)  Once the board of adjustment has completed a conditional use permit and all the conditions required are such type that they can be completely and permanently satisfied, the administrative official upon request of the applicant may, if facts warrant, make a determination that the conditions have been satisfied, and note the conclusion in the margin of the conditional use permit which is on file in the office of the code administrator. Thereafter said use, if it continues to meet the other requirements of the regulations, will be treated as a permitted use. 
(6)  When an application is made for land located within or abutting any residential zoning district, written notice shall be given at least fourteen (14) days in advance of the public hearing on the application to the applicant, administrative official, the mayor and city clerk, an owner of every parcel of property adjoining the property to which the application applies. Written notice shall be by first class mail with certification by the board's secretary or other officer that the notice was mailed. It shall be the duty of the applicant to furnish to the board the name and address of each parcel of property as described in this subsection. Records maintained by the property valuation administrator may be relied upon conclusively to determine the identity and address of said owner. In the event such property is in condominium or cooperative forms of ownership, then the person notified by mail shall be the president or chairperson of the owner group which administers property commonly owned by the condominium or cooperative owners. A joint notice may be mailed to two (2) or more co-owners of an adjoining property who are listed in the property valuation records as having the same address. 
(7)  When any property within the required notification area for a public hearing upon a conditional use permit application is located within an adjoining city, county, or planning unit, notice of the hearing shall be given at least fourteen (14) days in advance of the hearing by first class mail to that unit's planning commission. If the adjoining property is not part of a planning unit, notice shall be given to the mayor of the city in which the property is located or, if the property is in an unincorporated area, notice shall be given to the judge/executive of the county in which the property is located. 
(q)  The board shall have the power to hear and decide on applications for variances. The board may impose any reasonable conditions or restrictions on any variance it decides to grant. 
(r)  Before any variance is granted, the board must find that the granting of the variance will not adversely affect the public health, safety or welfare, will not alter the essential character of the general vicinity, will not cause a hazard or a nuisance to the public and will not allow an unreasonable circumvention of the requirements of the zoning regulations. In making these findings the board shall consider whether: 
(1)  The requested variance arises from special circumstances which do not generally apply to land in the general vicinity, or in the same zone; 
(2)  The strict application of the provisions of the regulation would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of the land or would create an unnecessary hardship on the applicant; and 
(3)  The circumstances are the result of actions of the applicant taken subsequent to the adoption of the zoning regulation from which relief is sought. 
(s)  The board shall deny any request for a variance arising from circumstances that are the result of willful violations of the zoning regulation by the applicant subsequent to the adoption of the zoning regulation from which relief is sought. 
(t)  The board shall not possess the power to grant a variance to permit a use of any land, building, or structure which is not permitted by the zoning regulation in the zone in question, or to alter density requirements in the zone in question. 
(u)  A dimensional variance applies to the property for which it is granted, and not to the individual who applied for it. A variance also runs with the land and is transferrable to any future owner of the land, but it cannot be transferred by the application to a different site. 
(v)  The lawful use of a building or premises existing at the time of adoption of any zoning regulations affecting it may be continued, although such use does not conform to the provisions of such regulations except as otherwise provided herein. The board of adjustment shall not allow the enlargement or extension of a nonconforming use beyond the scope and area of its operation at the time the regulation which makes its use nonconforming was adopted, nor shall the board permit a change from one (1) nonconforming use to another unless the new nonconforming use is in the same or a more restrictive classification provided, however, the board of adjustments may grant approval, effective to maintain nonconforming use status, for enlargements or extensions, made or to be made to the facilities of a nonconforming use where the use consists of the presenting of a major public attraction or attractions such as a sports event or events, which has been presented at the same site over such period of years and has such attributes and public acceptance as to have attained local prestige and to have achieved the status of a public tradition, contributing substantially to the economy of the community and state, of which prestige and status the site is an essential element, and where the enlargement or extension was or is designed to maintain the prestige and status by meeting the increasing demand of participants and patrons. 
(w)  The board of adjustment shall have the power to hear and decide cases where it is alleged by an applicant that there is an error in any order, requirement, decision, grant or refusal made by an administrative official in the enforcement of the zoning regulations. Such appeal shall be taken within thirty (30) days. 
(x)  Appeals to the board may be taken by any person or entity claiming to be injuriously affected or aggrieved by an official action or decision of the zoning enforcement officer. Such appeal shall be taken within thirty (30) days after the appellant or his agent receives notice of the action appealed from, by filing with said officer and with the board a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof, and giving notice of such appeal to any and all parties of record. Said officer shall forthwith transmit to the board all papers constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken and shall be treated as and be the respondent in such further proceedings. At any hearing by the board any interested person may appeal and enter his appearance and all shall be given an opportunity to be heard. 
(y)  The board shall fix a reasonable time for hearing the appeal and give public notice in accordance with KRS Ch. 424, as well as written notice to the appellant and the administrative official at least one (1) week prior to the hearing and shall decide it within thirty (30) days. The affected party may appear at the hearing in person or by attorney. 
(z)  If no building permit has been issued and a builder begins or continues to build, a restraining order may be obtained upon application to the property court of record and evidence of the lack of a building permit shall establish a prima facie case for the issuance of the restraining order.

VII, §§ 7.01-7.07, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 12-83, adopted June 28, 1983; Ord. No. 18-91, § 1, adopted May 14, 1991; Ord. No. 48-94, adopted Sept. 13, 1994; Ord. No. 59-95, adopted Dec. 26, 1995; Ord. 02-01, adopted Jan. 23, 2001; and Ord. No. 13-12, adopted May 8, 2012. 

Sec. 7.01. - Application for amendment. 
    A proposal for amendment of the zoning ordinance may originate with the planning commission, legislative body, and other government body, the owner of the subject property or by a person having written authorization from the owner of the subject property. Regardless of the origin of the proposed amendment, an application must be filed with the planning commission at least twenty-one (21) days prior to the first Tuesday of the following month requesting the proposed amendment, accompanied by such information as required by this zoning ordinance and in such form as established by the planning commission. The planning commission may require the submission of further information subsequent to the filing of an application, a nonreturnable filing fee shall be paid according to the schedule of fees as established herein. Upon the filing of an application for a zoning map amendment by a governmental body, the planning commission shall promptly notify the owner of the subject property. In accordance with KRS 100.212, regardless of the origin of a proposed zoning map amendment, the owners of all property adjoining the subject property shall be notified. Property owners across public rights-of-way shall be notified as they are considered adjoining. 
(Ord. No. 23-14, Exh. A, 7-8-14) 
Sec. 7.02. - Commission procedure. 
    Upon the filing of an application for an amendment to this zoning ordinance, the planning commission shall study and review the application as provided in this zoning ordinance and the bylaws of the Henderson City-County Planning Commission. 
(Ord. No. 23-14, Exh. A, 7-8-14) 
Sec. 7.03. - Notice of public hearing. 
    Before voting upon any proposed amendment, notice of the time, place and reason for holding a public hearing shall be given as required by KRS Ch. 424 and KRS 100.212 and 100.211. 
(Ord. No. 23-14, Exh. A, 7-8-14) 
Sec. 7.04. - Public hearing on application. 
    After notice of the public hearing as provided herein above, the planning commission shall hold at least one (1) public hearing on the proposed amendment. 
(Ord. No. 23-14, Exh. A, 7-8-14) 
Sec. 7.05. - Recommendation of the planning commission on zoning amendment. 
    The planning commission shall make its recommendation to the board of commissioners within sixty (60) days of the advertised public hearing. In its finding the planning commission may after careful review, as a condition to the granting of any zoning change, require the submission of a development plan which, where agreed upon, shall be followed. Development plan means written and graphic material for the provision of a development including any or all of the following: Location and bulk of buildings and other structures, intensity of use, density of development, streets, ways, parking facilities, signs, drainage of surface water, access points, a plan for screening or buffering, utilities, existing manmade and natural conditions, and all other conditions agreed to by the applicant. The development plan shall become part of the ordinance for amendment upon motion and approval by the planning commission and is then considered as part of the findings recommended to the board of commissioners. The development plan shall not take the place of submission of a subdivision plat through the planning commission. Before recommending to the board of commissioners that an application for amendment to the zoning ordinance be granted, the planning commission shall find that the map amendment is in agreement with the comprehensive plan or in the absence of such a finding that: 
(1)  The existing zoning classification given to the property was inappropriate or improper; or 
(2)  That there have been major changes of an economic, physical or social nature within the area involved which were not anticipated in the comprehensive plan, and which have substantially altered the basic character of such area. The findings of fact made by the planning commission shall be recorded in the minutes and records of the planning commission. After voting to recommend that an application for amendment to the zoning ordinance be granted or denied, the planning commission shall forward its findings of fact and recommendation in writing to the board of commissioners. Once the planning commission has made a determination of fact and recommendation to the board of commissioners concerning the disposition of zoning on an individual tract of land, said tract of land, or any portion thereof, shall not be reconsidered by the planning commission for reclassification to the same zone for a period of at least six (6) months, except upon application for reclassification initiated by the planning commission or board of commissioners. 
(Ord. No. 23-14, Exh. A, 7-8-14) 
Sec. 7.06. - Action by the legislative body on zoning ordinance amendments. 
    The board of commissioners shall not act upon a proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance until it shall have received written findings of fact and recommendation thereon from the planning commission. Proposed map amendments may follow the alternative zoning regulations of KRS 100.2111. The planning commission recommendation relating to the proposed amendment shall become final and the map amendment shall be automatically implemented subject to the provisions of KRS 100.347, all as set forth in the planning commission recommendations, unless within twenty-one (21) days after final action by the planning commission: 
a)  Any aggrieved party files a written request with the planning commission that the final decision shall be made by the appropriate fiscal body; or 
b)  The appropriate legislative body or fiscal court files a notice with the planning commission that the legislative body shall decide the map amendment. 
    If the alternative zoning regulation is not followed, before an amendment to the zoning ordinance is granted the board of commissioners must find that the map amendment is in agreement with the comprehensive plan or, in the absence of such a finding that: 
(a)  The existing zoning classification given to the property was inappropriate or improper; or 
(b)  There have been major changes of an economic, physical, or social nature within the area involved which were not anticipated in the comprehensive plan which have substantially altered the basic character of such area. 
    It shall take a majority of the entire board of commissioners to override the recommendation of the planning commission. Unless a majority of the entire board of commissioners votes to override the planning commission's recommendation, such recommendation shall become final and effective, and if a recommendation of approval was made by the planning commission, the ordinance of the board of commissioners adopting the zoning map amendment shall be deemed to have passed by operation of law. Upon approval the ordinance with development plans including written agreements, if any, will be published and recorded in the same manner as all other municipal ordinances. 
(Ord. No. 23-14, Exh. A, 7-8-14) 
Sec. 7.07. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE VIII. - NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES[8] 

Footnotes: 
--- (8) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 23-14, Exh. A, adopted July 8, 2014, amended art. VIII in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former art. VIII, §§ 8.01-8.08, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 12-83, adopted June 28, 1983; and Ord. No. 1-13, adopted Jan. 22, 2013. 

Sec. 8.01. - Statement of purpose. 
    Within the zones and districts established by this zoning ordinance, or amendments thereto, there exist lots, uses of land and structures, and characteristics of use which were lawful before this zoning ordinance was adopted or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this zoning ordinance or future amendment. It is the purpose of this zoning ordinance to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this zoning ordinance that nonconformities shall not be enlarged or extended beyond the scope and area of their operation at the time of the adoption or amendment of this zoning ordinance, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same zone. 
    To avoid undue hardship nothing in this zoning ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building or premises on which an application for a building permit was filed with the building inspector prior to the date of adoption of this zoning ordinance or amendment thereto. The issuance of said permit shall be valid only in the event that construction on said structure or premises, in accordance with the plans and specifications submitted with the application for a building permit, is begun within sixty (60) days after the date of issuance of said permit and is diligently carried on. Actual construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in permanent manner. Where grading or excavation, or demolition or removal of an existing building has been begun preparatory to rebuilding or reusing the premises, such grading or excavation, or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction provided that work shall be carried on diligently. 
(Ord. No. 23-14, Exh. A, 7-8-14) 
Sec. 8.02. - Nonconforming lots of record. 
a.  At the time of the adoption of this zoning ordinance, there exist lots of official record which do not include sufficient land to conform to the site development or other requirements of the zone(s) in which they are located. Such lots may be used as a building site, and the zoning administrator is authorized to issue a permit for the use of the property which conforms to the zoning requirements for the district in which the lots are located as set forth in this ordinance. If proposed structures cannot comply with the abovementioned requirements, an application may be submitted before the board of adjustments for a variance from the terms of the zoning ordinances as per the terms of Section 5.01. 
b.  A nonconforming lot, may not be further subdivided or consolidated in whole, or in part, with another parcel in a manner that increases its nonconformity. It may, however, be altered so as to decrease its nonconformity. However, the planning commission may approve the subdivision of a nonconforming lot of record, which has two (2) or more legally constructed principal structures, into separate parcels, for the purpose of sale or transfer of the individual residences if the planning commission makes findings that the properties have been used in a separate and distinct manner with separate utilities and other facilities, so that the resulting subdivision will not constitute a material change in the use of the property. 
(Ord. No. 23-14, Exh. A, 7-8-14) 
Sec. 8.03. - Nonconforming uses of land. 
    Pursuant to KRS 100.253, any use that has legally existed at the time of the adoption or amendment of this zoning ordinance, may be continued, although such use does not conform to the provisions of such regulations, except as otherwise provided herein: 
a)  No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or extended from the date of the adoption or amendment of this zoning ordinance. 
b)  The board of adjustment shall not allow the enlargement or extension of a nonconforming use beyond the scope and area of its operation at the time the regulation which makes its use nonconforming was adopted, nor shall the board permit a change from one (1) nonconforming use to another unless the new nonconforming use is in the same or a more restrictive classification, provided however, the board of adjustment may grant approval, effective to maintain nonconforming use status, for enlargements or extensions, made or to be made, of the facilities of the nonconforming use, where the use consists of the presenting of a major public attraction or attractions, such as sports event or events, which has been presented on the same site over such period of years and has such attributes and public acceptance as to have attained international prestige and to have achieved the status of public tradition, contributing substantially to the economy of the community and the state, of which prestige and status the site is an essential element, and where the enlargement or extension was or is designed to maintain the prestige and status by meeting the increased demands of participants and patrons. 
c)  Discontinuance: If a nonconforming use is discontinued for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months, all nonconforming rights are lost and reestablishment of the nonconforming use is prohibited. As used herein, the word "discontinuance" means that the landowner cannot demonstrate the clear intent to continue using the property for the nonconforming purpose. Intent may be demonstrated by the landowner, to provide clear and substantial documentation or evidence that the landowner has made clear and reasonable efforts to have the property rented or sold for the nonconforming purpose, or the property has been vacant or not in continuous use as a result of legal proceedings. 
d)  If a nonconforming use is changed to a conforming use, no matter how short the period of time, all nonconforming use rights are lost and reestablishment of the nonconforming use is prohibited. 
e)  Intentional damage or destruction: When a building holding a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed by causes within the control of the landowner or agent(s), including condemnation by gross negligence, all legal nonconforming use rights are lost and reestablishment of the nonconforming use is prohibited. 
(Ord. No. 23-14, Exh. A, 7-8-14) 
Sec. 8.04. - Nonconforming structures. 
    Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance that could not be built under the terms of this zoning ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful subject to the following provisions: 
(a)  No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, but proposed alterations and expansions are permitted when the proposed alteration or expansion complies with all applicable lot and building standards (for example, a building with a nonconforming front setback may be expanded to the rear as long as the rear expansion complies with the rear setback standards and all other applicable lot and building standards), but any structure or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity. 
(b)  Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of a structure be damaged, destroyed, or demolished by any means, it may be reconstructed or repaired within twelve (12) months of destruction, but not to extend or enlarge the scope of its nonconformity or to exceed the footprint or number of cubic feet which existed prior to damage, destruction or demolition. 
(Ord. No. 23-14, Exh. A, 7-8-14) 
Sec. 8.05. - Nonconforming uses of structures or of structures and premises in combination. 
    If lawful use involving individual structures or of structure and premises in combination exists at the date of adoption or amendment of this zoning ordinance that would not be allowed in the zone or district under the terms of this zoning ordinance, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(a)  No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this zoning ordinance in the zone or district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the zone or district in which it is located except as provided in subsection 8.05(e). 
(b)  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were arranged or designed for such use at the date of adoption or amendment of this zoning ordinance, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building. 
(c)  If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to another nonconforming use by appeal to the board of adjustment as provided under subsection 5.01(w) hereinabove if the proposed use is in the same or a more restrictive classification. In permitting such change, the board of adjustment may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the provisions of this zoning ordinance.

Footnotes: 
--- (9) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 23-14, Exh. A, adopted July 8, 2014, amended art. IX in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former art. IX, §§ 9.01-9.03 pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. 12-83, adopted June 28, 1983; Ord. No. 2-88, adopted Feb. 9, 1988; Ord. No. 17-89, § 2, adopted Aug. 8, 1989; Ord. No. 23-92, § 1, adopted July 14, 1992; Ord. No. 37-02, adopted Dec. 5, 2002; and Ord. No. 7-10, adopted April 15, 2010. 

Sec. 9.01. - Off-street parking requirements. 
    In all zoning districts, off-street parking spaces for the storage and parking of motor vehicles for the use of occupants, employees and patrons of the buildings hereafter erected, or enlarged after the effective date of these regulations, shall be provided as herein prescribed. The remodeling or alteration of present buildings would exempt from these provisions if: 
1.  The exterior dimensions are not changed; and 
2.  Any increase in floor space is confined within the basic structure; and 
3.  The principal use of the structure remains unchanged. 
    Required parking spaces shall be maintained and shall not be encroached upon so long as said main buildings or structures remain, unless an equivalent number of such spaces are provided elsewhere in conformance with these regulations. The owner or owners of a building, structure or other land use requiring off-street parking space must show, to the satisfaction of the building inspector, that he is the record title holder of the property devoted to said principal land use and of the property proposed for off-street parking use, or that he is the lessee of such property. 
(a)  Required off-street parking space. Off-street parking space shall be provided with vehicular access to a street or alley. Parking space shall be provided on the premises so that there will be no generation of automobile parking on any street. For the purposes of computing the number of spaces available in a given area, a standard vehicle parking space shall be computed as an area ten (10) feet wide by eighteen (18) feet long. Additional area will be required in order to provide vehicle maneuvering space, access and egress space. 
(b)  Fractional requirements. When units or measurements determining number of required parking spaces result in requirements of a fractional space, any fraction up to and including one-half (1/2) shall be disregarded and fractions over one-half (1/2) shall require one (1) parking space. 
(c)  Loading space limitations. Loading space as required in this article shall not be construed as supplying off-street parking space. 
(d)  Location of parking space for one- and two-family dwellings. The off-street parking facilities required for one- and two-family dwellings shall be located on the same lot or plot of ground as the building they are intended to serve, and shall consist of a garage, and/or a hard surfaced parking strip and parking apron, which connects to a publicly maintained street or alleyway. 
(e)  Location of parking space for other uses. The off-street parking facilities required for all other uses shall be located on the lot or within four hundred (400) feet of the permitted use requiring such off-street parking, such distance to be measured along lines of public access to the property between the nearest point of the parking facility to the building to be served. A legal agreement providing for the shared use of parking, must be executed by the parties involved, filed as a land use restriction (LUR) with the county clerk, and filed with the city codes and planning office. Shared parking privileges will continue in effect only as long as the agreement, binding upon both parties, remains in force. If the agreement is not in force, the normal parking standards will then apply. 
(f)  Usable floor area. For the purpose of this section, usable floor area in the case of offices, merchandising, or service types of uses, shall mean the gross floor area used or intended to be used by customers, patrons, clients, patients, owners, and tenants, less twenty (20) percent thereof. 
(g)  Seating capacity or seats. As used in this article for parking requirements, seating capacity or seats shall mean that each twenty-one (21) inches of seating facilities shall be counted as one (1) seat, except that where specifications and plans filed with the building inspector specify a certain seating capacity for a particular building, such specified seating capacity shall be used as the basis for required parking space. 
(h)  Bed. Whenever the term "bed" is herein referred to, it shall mean such beds as are occupied by the patient or guests of the hospital or building in question, provided however, that bassinets and incubators shall not be counted as beds. 
(i)  Similar uses and requirements. In the case of a use not specifically mentioned, the requirements for off-street parking facilities for a use which is so mentioned, and which said use is similar, shall apply. 
(j)  Existing off-street parking at effective date of regulation. Off-street parking existing at the effective date of these regulations which serves an existing building or use, shall not be reduced in size less than that required under the terms of these regulations. 
(k)  Collective provisions. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent collective provisions of off-street parking facilities for two (2) or more buildings or uses, provided such facilities collectively shall not be less than the sum of the requirements for the various individual uses computed separately in accordance with the table under this article. 
(l)  General use condition. Unless land is being used as storage space in connection with a repair or service garage business. The purpose and intention of the requirements of maintaining vehicle storage or parking space is to provide for the public safety in keeping parked cars off the streets. Such requirement is not designed to allow the storage or parking on such open land of wrecked or junked cars, in off-street parking areas or for creating a junkyard or nuisance. 
(m)  Joint use. Parking spaces already provided to meet off-street parking requirements for theaters, stadiums, auditoriums, and other places of public assembly, stores, office buildings, and industrial establishments lying within one thousand five hundred (1,500) feet of a church as measured along lines of public access, and that are not normally used between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m., on Sundays, and are made available for other parking, may be used to meet not more than seventy-five (75) percent of the off-street requirements of that use, or the church use. A legal agreement providing for the shared use of parking, must be executed by the parties involved, filed as a land use restriction (LUR) with the county clerk, and filed with the city codes and planning office. Shared parking privileges will continue in effect only as long as the agreement, binding upon both parties, remains in force. If the agreement is not in force, the normal parking standards will then apply. 
(n)  Required parking barriers. When off-street parking spaces or access aisles are located adjacent to the right-of-way line of a public street or alley, a concrete or asphalt curb measuring six (6) inches in height shall be placed along the edge of the parking space or access aisle for the purpose of preventing any vehicle encroachment onto the street or alley right-of-way. In no instance shall the vehicle encroach into the public street or alley right-of-way. 
(o)  Table of off-street parking requirements. The amount of off-street parking space required as specified above shall be determined in accordance with the following table, and the space so required shall be stated in the application for a building permit and shall be irrevocably reserved for such use and/or shall comply with the initial part of this section.

Sec. 9.02. - Off-street loading requirements. 
    On the same premises with every building, structure or part thereof, erected and occupied for manufacturing, storage, warehouse, truck freight terminal, goods display, department store, wholesale store, market, hotel, hospital, mortuary, laundry, dry cleaning or other uses similarly involving the receipt or distribution of vehicles, materials or merchandising, there shall be provided and maintained on the lot adequate space for standing, loading, and unloading services in order to avoid undue interference with public use of the streets and alleys.

    Such loading and unloading space, unless otherwise adequately provided for, shall be an area ten (10) feet by fifty (50) feet, within a fifteen-foot height clearance. The required loading space shall in no way impede any parking space or drive aisle, and shall be provided according to the following schedule:

(Ord. No. 23-14, Exh. A, 7-8-14) 
Sec. 9.03. - Off-street waiting area for drive-through facilities. 
    On the same premises with every building, structure or part thereof erected and occupied for the purpose of serving customers in their automobiles by means of a service window or similar arrangement where the automobile engine is not turned off, there shall be the following design queue standards: 
    All facilities that require the installation of a drive thru to serve customers whether for restaurants, pharmacies, banks, dry cleaners, car washes and others should provide sufficient room for waiting vehicles to stack. For each specific lane use, different queuing lengths are necessary to accommodate stacked vehicles. Table 11 outlines the recommended design queues based on lane use: 
Table 11: Recommended Queue Lengths for Drive Thru Facilities Fast food restaurant Nine (9) vehicles from order board Bank Seven (7) vehicles per teller stall Car wash-Self serve Four (4) vehicles per stall Car wash-Automated Ten (10) vehicles per stall with a minimum drying lane length of fifty (50) feet Pharmacy Four (4) vehicles per stall All other drive thru facilities A minimum of three (3) vehicles but more stringent requirements may be enforced at the discretion of the responsible authority  
    These requirements are necessary to prevent drive thru facilities from possibly interfering with traffic flow on adjacent streets and prevent undue congestion or confusion within on-site circulation. Depending upon use, it may be necessary to limit or remove parking that will back into the flow of drive thru traffic either before or after ordering and receiving. The fifty-foot requirement for automated car wash facilities is necessary to prevent undue amounts of water from collecting on the roadway which could create a safety hazard. 
    Any off-street waiting space is defined as an area ten (10) feet wide by twenty (20) feet long.

Sec. 10.04. - Computations. 
    The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign height. 
(a)  Computation of area of individual signs . The area of a sign face (which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one (1) face) shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed, but not including any canopy or marquee or any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets zoning ordinance regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself. See appendix 5. 
(b)  Computation of area of multi-faced signs. The sign area for a sign with more than one (1) face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any one (1) point. When two (2) identical sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more than forty-two (42) inches apart at the furthest point, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of one (1) of the faces. 
(c)  Computation of height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at the normal grade to the top for the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower of: 
(1)  Existing grade prior to the construction; or 
(2)  The newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on the lot, whichever is lower. 
(Ord. No. 26-99, § 1, 9-14-99; Ord. No. 17-11, Exh. A, 7-12-11) 
Sec. 10.05. - Permits required. 
    If a sign requiring a permit under the provision of this article is to be placed, constructed, erected, or modified on a lot, the owner of the lot shall secure a sign permit prior to the construction, placement, erection, or modification of such a sign in accordance with the requirements of section 10.17. 
    No sign permit of any kind shall be issued for an existing or proposed sign unless such sign is consistent with the requirements of this article (except for face changes on existing nonconforming signs) in every respect. 
(Ord. No. 26-99, § 1, 9-14-99; Ord. No. 17-11, Exh. A, 7-12-11) 
Sec. 10.06. - Design, construction, and maintenance. 
    All signs shall be designed, constructed, and maintained in accordance with the following standards: 
  All signs shall comply with applicable provisions of the Kentucky Building Code and the National Electrical Code adopted by the City of Henderson. 
  Except for banners, flags, temporary signs, and window signs conforming in all respects with the requirements of this article, all signs shall be constructed of permanent materials and shall be permanently attached to the ground, a building, or another structure by direct attachment to a rigid wall, frame, or structure. 
  All signs shall be maintained in good structural condition, in compliance with all building and electrical codes, and in conformance with this Code, at all times. 
  When any sign (including nonconforming signs) becomes defective or dangerous, as determined by the administrator, the administrator has the power and authority to remove or cause to have removed such sign when the owner or agent has failed to comply within thirty (30) days of time specified by the administrator to repair or make that sign safe or has failed to satisfy the administrator that the sign is not defective or dangerous. The owner or agent of the sign must bear the full costs of such removal and will be billed accordingly. If the administrator determines that the sign is of possible immediate danger to persons or vehicles that may be passing nearby, the administrator may place or cause to have placed signs or barriers indicating such danger.

 Computation of the maximum total sign area, the maximum area for individual signs, the height of signs and the number of freestanding signs allowed on the lot(s) included in the plan under this article; and 
 An accurately drawn indication on the plot plan of the proposed location of each present and future sign of any type, whether requiring a permit or not, except that incidental signs need not be shown. 
(b)  Limit on number of permanent freestanding signs. The signage site plan, for all lots with individual or multiple uses, shall limit the number of permanent freestanding signs to a total of one (1) for each street on which the lots included in the plan have frontage and may provide for shared or common usage of such signs when multiple uses occupy one lot. Billboards, as regulated under section 10.11, shall not be considered a permanent freestanding sign. 
(c)  Consent. The signage site plan shall be signed by all owners or their authorized agents in such form as the administrator requires. 
(d)  Procedures . A signage site plan shall be included in any development plan, site plan, planned unit development plan, or other official plan required by the city for the proposed development and shall be processed simultaneously with such other plan. 
(e)  Binding effect after approval of a signage site plan. No sign shall be erected, placed, painted, or maintained, except in conformance with such plan, and such plan may be enforced in the same way as any provision of this article. In case of any conflict between the provisions of such a plan and any other provision of this article, the ordinance shall control.

(b)  Duration of permit. The administrator shall cause an inspection to be made of the lot for which each permit for a new sign or for modification of an existing sign is issued during the sixth month after issuance of such permit or at such earlier date as the owner may request. If the construction is not substantially complete at the time of inspection, the permit shall lapse and become void. If the construction is substantially complete but not in full compliance with this article and applicable codes, the owner shall be given notice of the deficiencies and shall be granted an additional thirty (30) days from the date of inspection for the deficiencies to be corrected.

Sec. 10.19. - Nonconforming signs. 
    Permanent signs and billboards that are conforming at the time of the adoption of this article but which become nonconforming as a result of the requirements of this article because of size, placement, type or number of signs on the lot or building shall comply with the following requirements. 
(a)  No such nonconforming sign may be enlarged or structurally altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, but any portion thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity. The change in the text or color of a sign shall not be deemed to be an increase in its nonconformity. 
(b)  No nonconforming sign shall be relocated unless such relocation creates a conforming situation. 
(c)  Should a nonconforming sign or a portion of a nonconforming sign be damaged it may be repaired, but not to exceed the size and height of the original sign, and not in a manner which alters the original design of the sign structure. The structure must comply with all state and federal regulations. 
(d)  No nonconforming sign shall be allowed to remain after twelve (12) months of inactivity on the premises upon which the sign is located. 
(e)  No nonconforming off-premises sign shall be allowed to remain after the purpose to which the sign relates has been discontinued for a period of thirty (30) days. 
(f)  Whenever any sign that does not comply with the provisions and regulations of this article collapses, or if the sign is removed from its location, except for normal maintenance, the sign may not be replaced or reconstructed except in full compliance with all of the provisions and regulations of this chapter. However, if such a sign is removed or destroyed other than by intentional means of the owner, the sign may be reconstructed provided the owner make application to reconstruct within six (6) months of the date of removal or destruction, but the sign may not be enlarged, extended, or moved. 
(g)  If a nonconforming sign that was permitted at the time it was installed is required to be moved due to deed restrictions or encroachment over property boundaries that existed at the time of the original installation, or due to a taking or condemnation for public roadway improvements, and such taking is limited to only a portion of the sign, then the sign may be moved the minimum distance necessary at an angle perpendicular to the property line at the point of encroachment or taking of condemnation to comply with the deed restriction or property boundary, as long as it can be maintained on the same site, and provided that no dimensional changes are made relative to height, square footage, or total usable area. 
(h)  The administrator has the power and authority to remove or cause to have removed any and all signs that have been determined to be a traffic hazard when the owner or agent responsible for the maintenance of the sign has failed to eliminate such traffic hazards within two (2) weeks from the date the written notice is mailed by the administrator. The owner or agent must bear the full costs of such removal and will be billed accordingly. 
(Ord. No. 26-99, § 1, 9-14-99; Ord. No. 06-08, 4-8-08; Ord. No. 17-11, Exh. A, 7-12-11) 
Sec. 10.20. - Signs constituting a nuisance/abatement. 
(1)  The following signs shall constitute a nuisance: Refer to definition of an abandoned sign. 
a.  A sign in a dilapidated or unsafe condition or in a condition of disrepair. 
b.  A sign which remains in place following the period of time within which the sign was to have been removed. 
c.  A sign which is in nonconformance with the provisions as set forth in this chapter. 
(2)  Whenever the administrator shall deem such a nuisance to exist, the administrator shall issue a notice to the parties hereinafter stated, and such notice shall: 
a.  Be in writing; 
b.  Specify the identity of the sign and its location; 
c.  Request the nuisance to be abated; and 
d.  Advise the party(ies) that they have ten (10) days to abate the nuisance by removal or repair, as the case may be, or to make a written demand for a hearing before the board of adjustment, or else the nuisance will be removed and abated by the city at the owner's expense. 
(3)  The notice shall be sent by registered mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address of the owner of the property whereon the nuisance is located, as it appears on the current tax-assessment roll. Where the owner of the property is not the occupant thereof, such notice shall also be mailed to the occupant. The notice shall also be sent to the owner of the sign if the owner of the sign is not the owner or occupant of the property. If the owner's address is not known or cannot readily be ascertained, the notice to him to abate may be given by attaching such notice to the sign. If the latter method of service is used, the administrator shall make an affidavit attesting to such facts. 
(4)  In the event the owner, occupant, and owner of the sign fail to abate such public nuisance within the time as set forth above following receipt of notice, the administrator is hereby authorized, empowered and directed to remove same and dispose of it. 
(5)  Any interested party may appeal the decision of the administrator by appealing to the board of zoning adjustment. If an appeal is taken within the three-day period, the determination of the administrator is stayed pending the proceedings before the board of zoning adjustment. If no appeal is taken within this time period, the administrator shall have the right to cause the sign to be removed and disposed of in any manner as he may provide. 
(6)  The cost of the removal and disposal shall be accounted for by the administrator. The owner and occupant of the property upon which the sign is located and the owner of the sign shall be jointly and severally liable for reimbursement of such cost. In the event the full amount due the city for such service is not paid by such persons within thirty (30) day after the disposal of the nuisance, then and in that case, the administrator shall provide information to the city's finance department which includes the cost and expense incurred for the work, the date the work was done, and the location of the property on which the work was done. The finance department shall have recorded a sworn statement in the county clerk's office. The recordation of a sworn statement shall constitute a lien and privilege on the property, and shall remain in full force and effect for the amount due in principal and interest, plus attorney fees and court costs, if any, for collection, until final payment has been made. Sworn statements recorded in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be prima facie evidence that all legal formalities have been complied with and shall be full notice to every person concerned that the amounts due constitutes a charge against the property designated or described in the statement and that the same is due and collectable as provided by law. 
(7)  The city shall be entitled to recover from the responsible party or parties the total cost of removal and disposal, plus interest thereon, and all reasonable attorney fees and other costs incurred by the city by reason of the collection upon and enforcement of the responsible party or parties' liability hereunder, and the lien which secures same. Interest shall accrue on such costs at the legal rate of eight (8) percent per annum.

Sec. 14.01. - Statement of purpose. 
    These districts are composed primarily of areas containing a mixture of one-family, two-family, and multiple-family dwellings. The district regulations are designed to protect the residential character of the areas by prohibiting commercial activities, to encourage a suitable neighborhood environment for family life by including among the permitted uses such facilities as schools and churches, to prevent overcrowding of the land by requiring certain minimum yard and other open spaces for all buildings, and to avoid excessive population density by requiring a certain minimum building site area for each dwelling unit. 
(Ord. No. 23-14, Exh. A, 7-8-14)

Footnotes:

Editor's note- Ord. No. 23-14, Exh. A, adopted July 8, 2014, amended art. XV in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former art. XV, §§ 15.01-15.03 pertained to R-PUD, residential planned unit development district, and derived from Ord. No. 12-83, adopted June 28, 1983; Ord. No. 18-91, § 1, adopted May 14, 1991; and Ord. No. 06-03, adopted April 8, 2003. 

Sec. 15.01. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the intention of this section to provide flexibility in design and orientation for the establishment of a structure or group of structures which include multiple dwellings designed in a planned unit development of more than one (1) building on a given site. The requirements of area, height, bulk, parking and placement regulations, as they are usually applicable to individual buildings and individual lots of record, would in certain cases of large scale development have results affording less protection to the public health, safety and welfare than if a measure of flexibility were permitted. The permitting of these planned unit developments as special and particular land uses can, in certain cases, increase the desirability and convenience to the residents or occupants of the planned unit development without causing adverse effects on adjoining properties. 
    Therefore, the zoning ordinance regulations relative to area, height, bulk parking and placement may, in the planned unit development district, be modified by [actions of] the planning commission, which, in their judgment, provide adequate open space and improvement for circulation, recreation, education, light, air and service needs of the tract when fully developed, provided that in no case may the density of the proposed planned unit development exceed that of the zoning ordinance requirements enumerated in article XXVII of this ordinance. 
    Within the planned unit development district the following regulations shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 23-14, Exh. A, 7-8-14; Ord. No. 53-17, 8-25-17)

Sidewalks shall be constructed to Section 5.7 of the Henderson City-County Subdivision Regulations. 
D.  Buffers: Internal buffers of no less than fifteen (15) feet shall be installed between dissimilar uses within the PUD, and external buffers of no less than twenty-five (25) feet shall be installed between dissimilar uses of adjoining lots outside of the boundaries of the PUD. 
E.  PUD open space: Generally, PUDs shall include dedicated acreage for open space in accordance with the formula established in subsection (1), below. Open space may include a combination of common and recreational (active or passive) elements as indicated in subsection (2) below, so long as a minimum of twenty-five (25) percent of the recreational elements provided are made up of active features. The use of specific elements shall be at the discretion of the developer. Open space shall be provided in a manner that is sensitive to the design and anticipated use of the proposed development and should be designed to provide maximum benefit to the inhabitants of the development through its central location, when possible. Location of features along the exterior boundary of the PUD is discouraged. 
1.  Open space calculation formulas. To calculate the required open space involves the use of two (2) formulas; the formula for the recreational open space and the formula for the common open space. The results obtained from the two (2) formulas are then added together to determine the total required open space: 
(a)  Recreational PUD open space: At a minimum, the amount of recreational open space within a PUD shall be calculated according to the following formula: 
A 1 = D × 2.2 × 0.01 
Where: 
A 1 = the required upland open space area; 
D = the number of dwelling units in the PUD; 
Average household density = 2.2 persons; and the 
Number of acres required per person = 0.01 acres per person. 
(b)  Common PUD open space: 
A 1 = D × 2.2 × 0.01 / 2 
where: 
A 1 = the required common open space area; 
D = Number of dwelling units in a PUD; 
Average household density = 2.2 persons; and the 
Number of acres required per person = 0.01 acres per person. 
2.  Acceptable common and recreational open space features. 
(a)  Common open space uses include, but are not limited to: 
i.  Natural open water bodies and/or water bodies of at least three (3) acres in size capable of supporting aquatic life (generally with a depth of at least four and one-half (41/2) feet that can serve for recreational uses. 
ii.  Natural areas of undisturbed vegetation with maintenance limited to removal of litter, dead trees, plant material and brush. 
iii.  Areas of cultural significance such as locally or nationally listed historic and archeological sites (including structures). 
A developer proposing to use lakes or stormwater ponds to meet the common space requirements must provide certification to the HWU and city engineer that such lake or stormwater pond has been designated to be perpetually filled and capable of supporting aquatic life (generally a minimum perpetual water depth of eight (8) feet from the bottom storage or outlet elevation is required). 
(b)  Recreational open space uses include, but are not limited to: 
(i)  Parks, play grounds, tot-lots, dog parks, picnic areas, basketball courts, tennis courts, swimming pools and similar uses. 
(ii)  Greenways, greenbelts, squares and village greens. 
(iii)  Bicycle paths, bridle paths, footpaths and sidewalks provided such paths are improved with a surface suitable for the intended use. 
(iv)  Lands and appropriate facilities that provide access to rivers and waterways. 
(v)  Land burdened with easements may be used provided that the easements do not interfere with the use of the land for open space and recreational purposes and if future development does occur, then alternate open space is provided. 
3.  Documentation of PUD open space. The provision of open space shall be documented within the written narrative and shown on the conceptual plan. Expected narrative and conceptual plan contents to address this requirement are stated below. 
(a)  Written narrative contents. The written narrative shall explain the intended use of any open space and provide detail as to how such spaces will be accessible, integrated to the overall development and maintained. A single statement indicating that open space will be provided is not acceptable. 
(b)  Conceptual plan content. The conceptual plan shall show all areas intended for open space with their acreage and intended access points. Additionally, a conceptual layout of the equipment or features that will be located in such areas shall be provided as either an attachment to the PUD application or on the conceptual plan. 
4.  Open space access. Open space shall be accessible to all inhabitants of the development. Access to such features shall be provided through a minimum twenty-foot dedicated access point, and not via open storm drainage ditches, swales or easements between or across adjacent properties. Access, however, may be provided via a twenty-foot wide easement over piped storm drainage ditches, swales, or easements, subject to the city engineer and HWU engineering approval. Access easements to be shared with improvements adjacent to drainage must be approved by the appropriate agency. 
5.  Open space requirement for commercial PUDs: Commercial PUDs shall provide a minimum of five (5) percent of the total project area as open space. 
F.  Parking: 
1.  Location: 
(a)  On-site parking areas shall be located at the rear or side of the building except for driveways connecting to the rear or side of-street parking area, unless modified by the planning commission. No on-street parking shall be located at the corner of two (2) intersecting streets. 
2.  Parking reduction: All commercial uses, and mixed use buildings, are allowed a fifty-percent parking reduction from the required on-site parking spaces as set forth in section 9.01, should they satisfy two (2) of the following requirements for reduction. This exemption does not include any reduction of required ADA compliant handicap parking. 
(a)  Rain gardens and best management practices constitute a significant means of treating stormwater; 
(b)  The parking areas utilize pervious concrete or pavers;

The intent of this regulation is to provide for the development in desirable areas of the city, based upon the comprehensive plan, of those heavy commercial and industrial establishments which may create some nuisance and which are not properly associated with or compatible with any of the development proposed for the other land use districts. These uses are primarily of a manufacturing, assembling, and fabricating nature requiring good access by road, railroad, and/or river or water access and needing special sites or public utility services. Reasonable regulations apply to uses in this district, so as to permit the location of industries which will not cause adverse effects on residential and commercial areas. 
    Purpose and findings for regulation of sexually oriented businesses. It is the purpose of these provisions to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city. These regulations have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent of these regulations to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of these regulations to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. 
    Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses as set forth in reports made available to the board of commissioners, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976); FW/PBS, Inc., v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215 (1990); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 120 S. Ct. 1382 (2000); and on studies in other communities including, but not limited to: Dallas, Texas; Town and Village of Ellicottville, New York; Tucson, Arizona; St. Mary's, Georgia; St. Croix County, Wisconsin; Newport News, Virginia; and Garden Grove, California; and also on findings from the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group On The Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the board of commissioners finds: 
(1)  There is convincing documented evidence, including statistics and studies performed in a substantial number of communities concerning the serious objectionable characteristics and secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses in other jurisdictions; 
(2)  There is substantial evidence that an increase in crime tends to accompany, concentrate around, and be aggravated by sexually oriented businesses, including but not limited to increase in the crimes related to prostitution, sale and possession of controlled substances and violence against persons and property; 
(3)  There are unique harmful effects on children and minors exposed to the effects of sexually oriented businesses, including but not limited to, the deterioration of respect for family values, exposure to images and acts for which they are too young or immature to fully understand, and the possibility that such children or minors could inadvertently become targets or otherwise victims of solicitations of a sexual nature for which they are too young or immature to understand or otherwise take appropriate measure to protect themselves; 
(4)  Sexually oriented businesses adversely impact property values and the character of the surrounding neighborhoods and business areas, which together have a deleterious effect on the health and welfare of the community; 
(5)  Sexually oriented businesses have both a real and a perceived negative impact on surrounding properties, including crime rates that are higher and property values that are lower. Their presence influences the public's perception of the neighborhood in which they are located, and can create "dead zones" in commercial areas where shoppers do not want to be associated in any way with sexually oriented businesses, nor have their children walk by such uses. 
(6)  The findings noted in subsections (1) through (5) raise substantial governmental concerns; and 
(7)  The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by these regulations.

(Ord. No. 23-14, Exh. A, 7-8-14) 
Sec. 24.03. - Conditional uses. 
    The following shall require a conditional use permit according to the procedure in Section 4.03: Any use not in conflict with any other ordinances of the city, provided however, that the following uses shall be considered conditional uses and require approval by the board of zoning adjustment: bag cleaning, boiler works, crematoriums, tank works, central mixing plant for cement, mortar, plaster or paving materials, coke oven, curing, tanning and storage of raw hides and skins, distillation of bones, coal, wood or tar, fat rendering, forge plant, foundry or metal fabrication plant, gasoline or oil storage aboveground in excess of five hundred (500) gallons, slaughterhouse or stockyards, recycling processing facility, public or private landfills and sewerage disposal plant, river terminal/barge facility, smelting plant, and the manufacturing of acetylene, acid, alcohol, or alcoholic beverages, ammonia, bleaching powder, chemicals, brick, pottery, terra cotta or tile, candles, disinfectants, dyestuffs, fertilizers, illuminating or heating gas, (or storage of same), linseed oil, paint, oil, turpentine, varnish, soap and tar products, synthetic fuel production or operation, shooting range, indoors (must meet all federal, state, and local regulations),or any other use which in the opinion of the board of zoning adjustment would emit detrimental or obnoxious noise, vibrations, smoke, odors, dust or other objectionable conditions beyond the confines of its property. The board may grant approval if it determines that the proposed use would not extend its detrimental or obnoxious effects beyond the limits of the heavy industrial district in which it is located.

    This article is intended to promote the use and development of land in a manner that is compatible with the continued operation and utility of the Henderson City-County Airport so as to protect the public investment in and benefit provided by the facility to the region. The article also protects the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare of citizens who utilize the facility or live and work in the vicinity by preventing the creation or establishment of obstructions or incompatible land uses that are hazardous to the airport's operation or public welfare. 
    It is hereby found that an obstruction has the potential for endangering the lives and property of users of the Henderson City-County Airport, and property or occupants of land in its vicinity; that an obstruction may affect existing and future instrument approach minimums for the Henderson City-County Airport; and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the Henderson City-County Airport and the public investment therein. Accordingly, it is declared: 
(a)  That the creation or establishment of an obstruction has the potential of being a public nuisance and may injure the region served by Henderson City-County Airport. 
(b)  That it is necessary in the interest of the health, safety, and general welfare that the creation or establishment of obstructions that are a hazard to air navigation be prevented. 
(c)  That the prevention of these obstructions should be accomplished, to the extent legally possible, by the exercise of the police power without compensation. 
(d)  It is further declared that the prevention of the creation or establishment of hazards to air navigation; the elimination, removal, alteration or mitigation of hazards to air navigation; or the marking and lighting of obstructions are public purposes for which a political subdivision may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or interests in the land.

(4)  In areas lying outside other airport zones but within navigable airspace, no permit shall be required for the establishment of structures which extend less than two hundred (200) feet in height above the ground. 
(5)  Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any structure, or growth of any tree in excess of any of the height limits established by this except as set forth in Section 28.04. 
(b)  Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use, structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on the effective date of this article or any amendments thereto or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for such a permit shall be granted. 
(c)  Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the enforcement officer determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been abandoned or more than eighty (80) percent torn down, physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. 
(d)  Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit the growth of any street, or use property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this article, may apply to the board of zoning adjustment for a variance from such regulations. The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the Federal Aviation Administration and Kentucky Airport Zoning Commission as to the effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will result in unnecessary hardship and relief granted, will not be contrary to the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this article. Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this article may be considered by the board of adjustment unless a copy of the application has been furnished to the Henderson City-County Air Board for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If the Henderson City-County Air Board does not respond to the application within fifteen (15) days after receipt, the board of zoning adjustment may act on its own to grant or deny said application.

This does not include existing structures erected for another primary purpose, but which subsequently have cellular antennas attached to or located within them, without any reconstruction of the original structure. For the provisions of these regulations, an alternative cellular antenna tower is considered a cellular antenna tower. 
    Antennas or related equipment means transmitting, receiving, or other equipment used to support cellular telecommunications service or personal communications service. This definition does not include towers. 
    Cellular antenna, rooftop means any exterior transmitting or receiving device mounted on, or attached to, the rooftop of a building through gravity mounts or other surface attachments used for wireless or other telecommunication signals; integrated into the natural rooftop profile of a building so that it resembles a permissible rooftop structure, such as a ventilator, cooling equipment, solar equipment, water tank, chimney or parapet. 
    Cellular antenna tower means a tower constructed for, or an existing facility that has been adapted for, the location of transmission or related equipment to be used in the provision of cellular telecommunications services or personal communications services. 
    Cellular antenna tower height means the distance from the anchored base of the tower, whether on the top of another building or at grade, to the highest point of the antenna structure. 
    Cellular equipment cabinet means a cabinet designed to house radio equipment, similar in size to a traffic signal cabinet, not designed for human occupancy. Any maintenance to radio equipment can only be done from outside the cabinet, as opposed to a larger sized equipment shelter that can be totally accessed by service personnel. 
    Cellular telecommunications service means a retail telecommunications service that uses radio signals transmitted through cell sites and mobile switching stations. 
    Cellular telephone transmitting facility, temporary means any system of wires, poles, rods, reflecting disks, or similar devices used for the transmission or reception of electromagnetic waves, not meeting the definition of a "structure" as defined by this zoning ordinance. Temporary facilities shall be subject to issuance of a locational permit from the division of planning prior to being located on a property. 
    Co-location means locating two (2) or more transmission antennas or related equipment on the same cellular antenna tower. 
    Environmentally sensitive areas means significant wildlife habitat and migration corridors, unique vegetation and critical plant communities, and ridge lines. 
    Geologic hazards means unstable or potentially unstable slopes, undermining, faulting, landslides, rockfalls, flood, wildfire, or similar naturally occurring dangerous features or soil conditions or natural features unfavorable to development. 
    Guyed cellular antenna tower means a type of wireless transmission tower that is supported by thin guy wires. 
    Lattice cellular antenna tower means a self-supporting tower with multiple legs and cross bracing of structural steel. 
    Monopole cellular antenna tower means a slender self-supporting tower on which wireless antenna can be placed. 
    Personal communication service has the meaning as defined in 47 U.S.C. Section 332(c).

(Ord. No. 23-14, Exh. A, 7-8-14) 
Sec. 29.03. - Where permitted. 
A.  To the greatest extent feasible, applicants are encouraged to consider properties owned by the local government for the location of cellular towers. Whenever possible, cellular antenna towers, whether temporary or permanent, shall be sited at locations that minimize their adverse effect on residential uses in the immediate area. Only when no other adequate site is available shall a cellular antenna tower be permitted in a residential zone, unless located on a property not used or intended for residential purposes. In accordance with the procedures established by this article, cellular antenna towers may be permitted in any zone when approved by the planning commission, with the following exceptions: 
1.  No cellular antenna tower shall be constructed on land that is environmentally sensitive or a geologic hazard area as delineated in the Henderson City-County Comprehensive plan and the definitions herein, unless the tower has received approval or necessary permits from the appropriate state or federal governmental regulatory agency charged with permitting activities in these areas. 
2.  No cellular antenna tower shall be located along a scenic byway, as designated by the State of Kentucky, so as to have a negative impact on the scenic qualities of the roadway and the views from the roadway. When approved by the planning commission, any wireless communication facility proposed to be located along a state and/or federally designated scenic byway, or within a scenic view corridor, shall be located on an existing tower structure or utility pole, or shall be designed as an alternative tower, as described in Section 29.02. Any tower or antenna that is not an alternative tower design shall be designed to blend into the surrounding environment through the use of color and/or other camouflaging architectural treatments, except in instances where color is dictated by federal or state authorities, such as the Federal Aviation Administration. In addition, the base of the tower and any supporting equipment shall be located either three hundred (300) feet from the right-of-way, or beyond the view shed of the designated scenic byway; whichever is greater. 
(Ord. No. 23-14, Exh. A, 7-8-14) 
Sec. 29.04 - Uniform application requirements.
