PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete codification of the ordinances of Mount Carmel, Illinois, of a general and permanent nature. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such ordinances not included herein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
    The source of each section is included in the history note which appears in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Table appearing in the back of the volume, the reader can locate all laws and ordinances included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been appropriately catchlined to facilitate usage. Appropriate footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which also refer to relevant state laws have been included. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the twentieth section of Chapter 19 is 19-20. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and, at the same time, new sections, or even whole chapters, can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 4-12 and 4-13 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-12.1, 4-12.2, 4-12.3, respectively. New chapters may be included by the addition of a fraction after the chapter number, e.g., if the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13 it will be designated as Chapter 121/2. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of each chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this looseleaf system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Codes with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part thereof, as provided in Section 4 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Index 
    The general index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Acknowledgments 
    The republication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Brian C. Taylor, Supplement Editor, and Aline L. True, Accuracy Management Coordinator, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Mr. Mike Gidcumb, City Inspector for his cooperation and interest during the progress of the work on this Code.

Sec. 1-4. - Amendments to Code. 
    All ordinances passed subsequent to this Code which amend, repeal or in any way affect this Code may be numbered in accordance with the numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion herein, or in the case of repealed chapters, sections and subsections or any part thereof, by subsequent ordinances, such repealed portions may be excluded from the Code by omission from reprinted pages affected thereby and the subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed or omitted, in the case of repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such time as this Code of Ordinances and subsequent ordinances numbered or omitted are readopted as a new code of ordinances by the city council. (Rev. Ords., § 2-3) 
Sec. 1-5. - Unauthorized alterations or tampering with Code. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person in the city to change or amend, by additions or deletions, any part or portion of this Code, or to insert or delete pages, or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner whatsoever which will cause the law of the city to be misrepresented thereby.

(1947 Rev. Ords., § 2-7) 
Sec. 1-7. - Severability of parts of Code. 
    The sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this Code are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this Code shall be declared unconstitutional, invalid or unenforceable by the valid judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality, invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and sections of this Code. 
Sec. 1-8. - Jurisdictional scope. 
    Unless otherwise provided herein, this Code applies to acts performed within the corporate limits of the city. Provisions of this Code also apply to acts performed outside the corporate limits and up to the limits prescribed by law, where the law confers power on the city to regulate such particular acts outside the corporate limits.

Sec. 1-10. - General penalty for violation of Code; continuing violations. 
(a)  Penalty. A violation of this code shall be trial able as civil cases whenever, in this code or in any ordinance of the city, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an offense or whenever in this code or other ordinance the doing of any act is required or the failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful or an offence where no specific penalty is provided; therefore, the violation of any such provision of this code, or any other ordinance, shall be punished by a fine of not less than $75.00 nor more than $200.00, each day the willful violation of any provisions of this code or of any other ordinance, shall constitute a separate offence. 
(b)  Redemption of vehicle. Before the owner or person entitle to possession of any vehicle impounded for any traffic violation, misdemeanor, criminal offense or warrant arrest, which required a custodial arrest, as defined by the state, a minimum fee of $75.00 per vehicle shall be payable to the city. A minimum fee of $200.00, per vehicle, shall be paid in connection with the custodial arrest of any driver of a vehicle for the offense of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs or any felony level offense, as defined by the state, or the United States of America. Said fee shall be paid at the city police department prior to the release of the vehicle. 
Such fees shall be deposited with the city and identified for police department use. 
The above fees are to be paid by the registered owner or person seeking the vehicles release regardless of whether the owner of said vehicle or any other authorized person was driving the vehicle at the time of the arrest and impoundment by the city police department. 
For all other vehicles towed by the city police department, for any reason other than the above listed offenses, a tow release will be issued by the city police department, free of charge. 
It shall be the duty of the towing or salvage company, in possession of the vehicle, to obtain documentation issued by the city police department confirming compliance with the foregoing requirement and to retain photo copies of the documentation in their files for a period of not less than six months following release of the vehicle. The foregoing information shall be made available to the authorities of the city for inspection and copying, upon their request, by the towing or storage company. The towing or storage company is prohibited from releasing any vehicle they may tow within the city until and unless they have obtained the documentation as aforesaid. The towing or salvage company shall be entitled to receive a fee from the owner or person entitled to possession of any such vehicle prior to the release of the vehicle. The fee shall be to cover costs of removing said vehicle and in addition thereto, the costs of storage of said vehicle for each day (or fraction thereof) that said vehicle shall have remained stored. The foregoing fees shall be an addition to any fees levied or assessed against the owner or operator of the vehicle by reason of violation of any ordinance or statute and any arrest, which may have resulted from such violation.

(4)  Notification. It is the responsibility of every employee to identify to the city clerk any personal relationship which falls under the prohibitions identified in this policy. Employees who fail to disclose personal relationships covered by this policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including the termination of employment. 
(5)  Where the terms of this section require an evaluation whether employment, promotion or transfer of a family member could create an adverse impact on work performance, an actual conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest, such decision shall be made in the reasonable judgment of: (a) in the case of an extended family member of the city clerk or an elected official, the disinterested members of the city council, or (b) in the case of a family member of all other city staff, the city clerk.

ARTICLE IX. - POLICY PROHIBITING SEXUAL HARASSMENT[12] 

Footnotes: 
--- (12) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1083, § 1(Exh. A), adopted January 2, 2018, added provisions to the Code but did not specify manner of inclusion. Therefore, at the discretion of the editor, said provisions have been included as art. IX, §§ 2-291-2-296 herein. 

Sec. 2-291. - Prohibition on sexual harassment. 
    It is unlawful to harass a person because of that person's sex. The courts have determined that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination under Title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991. All persons have a right to work in an environment free from sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is unacceptable misconduct which affects individuals of all genders and sexual orientations. It is a policy of the city to prohibit harassment of any person by any municipal official, municipal agent, municipal employee or municipal agency or office on the basis of sex or gender. All municipal officials, municipal agents, municipal employees and municipal agencies or offices are prohibited from sexually harassing any person, regardless of any employment relationship or lack thereof. 
(Ord. No. 2083, § 1(Exh. A), 1-2-18) 
Sec. 2-292. - Definition of sexual harassment. 
    This policy adopts the definition of sexual harassment as stated in the Illinois Human Rights Act, which currently defines sexual harassment as: 
    Any unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors or any conduct of a sexual nature when: 
(1)  Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment; 
(2)  Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or 
(3)  Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment. 
Conduct which may constitute sexual harassment includes: 
 Verbal: sexual innuendos, suggestive comments, insults, humor, and jokes about sex, anatomy or gender-specific traits, sexual propositions, threats, repeated requests for dates, or statements about other employees, even outside of their presence, of a sexual nature. 
 Non-verbal: suggestive or insulting sounds (whistling), leering, obscene gestures, sexually suggestive bodily gestures, "catcalls," "smacking" or "kissing" noises. 
 Visual: posters, signs, pin-ups or slogans of a sexual nature, viewing pornographic material or websites. 
 Physical: touching, unwelcome hugging or kissing, pinching, brushing the body, any coerced sexual act or actual assault. 
 Textual/electronic: "sexting" (electronically sending messages with sexual content, including pictures and video), the use of sexually explicit language, harassment, cyber stalking and threats via all forms of electronic communication (e-mail, text/picture/video messages, intranet/on-line postings, blogs, instant messages and social network websites like Facebook and Twitter). 
The most severe and overt forms of sexual harassment are easier to determine. On the other end of the spectrum, some sexual harassment is more subtle and depends, to some extent, on individual perception and interpretation. The courts will assess sexual harassment by a standard of what would offend a "reasonable person." 
(Ord. No. 2083, § 1(Exh. A), 1-2-18) 
Sec. 2-293. - Procedure for reporting an allegation of sexual harassment. 
    An employee who either observes sexual harassment or believes herself/himself to be the object of sexual harassment should deal with the incident(s) as directly and firmly as possible by clearly communicating her/his position to the offending employee, and her/his immediate supervisor. It is not necessary for sexual harassment to be directed at the person making the report. 
    Any employee may report conduct which is believed to be sexual harassment, including the following: 
 Electronic/direct communication. If there is sexual harassing behavior in the workplace, the harassed employee should directly and clearly express her/his objection that the conduct is unwelcome and request that the offending behavior stop. The initial message may be verbal. If subsequent messages are needed, they should be put in writing in a note or a memo. 
 Contact with supervisory personnel. At the same time direct communication is undertaken, or in the event the employee feels threatened or intimidated by the situation, the problem must be promptly reported to the immediate supervisor of the person making the report, a department head, a director of human resources, an ethics officer, the city manager or administrator, or the chief executive officer of the municipality. 
The employee experiencing what he or she believes to be sexual harassment must not assume that the employer is aware of the conduct. If there are no witnesses and the victim fails to notify a supervisor or other responsible officer, the municipality will not be presumed to have knowledge of the harassment. 
 Resolution outside municipality. The purpose of this policy is to establish prompt, thorough and effective procedures for responding to every report and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied by the municipality. However, all municipal employees have the right to contact the Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) for information regarding filing a formal complaint with those entities. An IDHR complaint must be filed within 180 days of the alleged incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must be filed within 300 days. 
Documentation of any incident may be submitted with any report (what was said or done, the date, the time and the place), including, but not limited to, written records such as letters, notes, memos and telephone messages. 
All allegations, including anonymous reports, will be accepted and investigated regardless of how the matter comes to the attention of the municipality. However, because of the serious implications of sexual harassment charges and the difficulties associated with their investigation and the questions of credibility involved, the claimant's willing cooperation is a vital component of an effective inquiry and an appropriate outcome. 
(Ord. No. 2083, § 1(Exh. A), 1-2-18) 
Sec. 2-294. - Prohibition on retaliation for reporting sexual harassment allegations. 
    No municipal official, municipal agency, municipal employee or municipal agency or office shall take any retaliatory action against any municipal employee due to a municipal employee's: 
(1)  Disclosure or threatened disclosure of any violation of this policy; 
(2)  The provision of information related to or testimony before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing or inquiry into any violation of this policy; or 
(3)  Assistance or participation in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of this policy. 
For the purposes of this policy, retaliatory action means the reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, denial of promotion or transfer, or change in the terms or conditions of employment of any municipal employee that is taken in retaliation for a municipal employee's involvement in protected activity pursuant to this policy. 
No individual making a report will be retaliated against even if a report made in good faith is not substantiated. In addition, any witness will be protected from retaliation. 
Similar to the prohibition against retaliation contained herein, the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act (5 ILCS 430/15-10) provides whistleblower protection from retaliatory action such as reprimand, discharge, suspension, demotion, or denial of promotion or transfer that occurs in retaliation for an employee who does any of the following: 
(1)  Discloses or threatens to disclose to a supervisor or to a public body an activity, policy, or practice of any officer, member, state agency, or other state employee that the state employee reasonably believes is in violation of a law, rule, or regulation; 
(2)  Provides information to or testifies before any public body conducting an investigation, hearing, or inquiry into any violation of a law, rule, or regulation by any officer, member, state agency or other state employee; or 
(3)  Assists or participates in a proceeding to enforce the provisions of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act. 
Pursuant to the Whistleblower Act (740 ILCS 174/15(a)), an employer may not retaliate against an employee who discloses information in a court, an administrative hearing, or before a legislative commission or committee, or in any other proceeding, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule, or regulation. In addition, an employer may not retaliate against an employee for disclosing information to a government or law enforcement agency, where the employee has reasonable cause to believe that the information discloses a violation of a state or federal law, rule, or regulation. (740 ILCS 174/15(b)). 
According to the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101), it is a civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more people to conspire, to retaliate against a person because he/she has opposed that which he/she reasonably and in good faith believes to be sexual harassment in employment, because he/she has made a charge, filed a complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under the Illinois Human Rights Act. 
An employee who is suddenly transferred to a lower paying job or passed over for a promotion after filing a complaint with IDHR or EEOC, may file a retaliation charge-Due within 180 days (IDHR) or 300 days (EEOC) of the alleged retaliation. 
(Ord. No. 2083, § 1(Exh. A), 1-2-18) 
Sec. 2-295. - Consequences of a violation of the prohibition on sexual harassment. 
    In addition to any and all other discipline that may be applicable pursuant to municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/or collective bargaining agreement, any person who violates this policy or the prohibition on sexual harassment contained in 5 ILCS 430/5-65, may be subject to a fine of up to $5,000.00 per offense, applicable discipline or discharge by the municipality and any applicable fines and penalties established pursuant to local ordinance, state law or federal law. Each violation may constitute a separate offense. Any discipline imposed by the municipality shall be separate and distinct from any penalty imposed by an ethics commission and any fines or penalties imposed by a court of law or a state or federal agency. 
(Ord. No. 2083, § 1(Exh. A), 1-2-18) 
Sec. 2-296. - Consequences for knowingly making a false report. 
    A false report is a report of sexual harassment made by an accuser using the sexual harassment report to accomplish some end other than stopping sexual harassment or retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. A false report is not a report made in good faith which cannot be proven. Given the seriousness of the consequences for the accused, a false or frivolous report is a severe offense that can itself result in disciplinary action. Any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of this policy shall be subject to discipline or discharge pursuant to applicable municipal policies, employment agreements, procedures, employee handbooks and/or collective bargaining agreements. 
    In addition, any person who intentionally makes a false report alleging a violation of any provision of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act to an ethics commission, an inspector general, the state police, a state's attorney, the attorney general, or any other law enforcement official is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. An ethics commission may levy an administrative fine of up to $5,000.00 against any person who intentionally makes a false, frivolous or bad faith allegation.

The city shall document the basis for a denial, including the specific code provisions or application conditions on which the denial is based, and send the documentation to the applicant on or before the day the city denies an application. 
The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified by the city and resubmit the revised application once within 30 days after notice of denial is sent to the applicant without paying an additional application fee. The city shall approve or deny the revised application within 30 days after the applicant resubmits the application or it is deemed approved. Failure to resubmit the revised application within 30 days of denial shall require the application to submit a new application with applicable fees, and recommencement of the city's review period. 
The applicant must notify the city in writing of its intention to proceed with the permitted activity on a deemed approved basis, which may be submitted with the revised application. 
Any review of a revised application shall be limited to the deficiencies cited in the denial. However, this revised application does not apply if the cure requires the review of a new location, new or different structure to be collocated upon, new antennas, or other wireless equipment associated with the small wireless facility. 
e.  Pole attachment agreement. Within 30 days after an approved permit to collocate a small wireless facility on a municipal utility pole, the city and the applicant shall enter into a master pole attachment agreement, provided by the city for the initial collocation on a municipal utility pole by the application.

(3)  Completeness of application. Within 30 days after receiving an application, the city shall determine whether the application is complete and notify the applicant. If an application is incomplete, the city must specifically identify the missing information. An application shall be deemed complete if the city fails to provide notification to the applicant within 30 days after all documents, information and fees specifically enumerated in the city's permit application form are submitted by the applicant to the city. 
Processing deadlines are tolled from the time the city sends the notice of incompleteness to the time the applicant provides the missing information. 
(4)  Tolling. The time period for applications may be further tolled by: 
a.  An express written agreement by both the applicant and the city; or 
b.  A local, state or federal disaster declaration or similar emergency that causes the delay. 
(5)  Consolidated applications. An applicant seeking to collocate small wireless facilities within the jurisdiction of the city shall be allowed, at the applicant's discretion, to file a consolidated application and receive a single permit for the collocation of up to 25 small wireless facilities if the collocations each involve substantially the same type of small wireless facility and substantially the same type of structure. 
If an application includes multiple small wireless facilities, the city may remove small wireless facility collocations from the application and treat separately small wireless facility collocations for which incomplete information has been provided or that do not qualify for consolidated treatment or that are denied. The city may issue separate permits for each collocation that is approved in a consolidated application. 
(6)  Duration of permits. The duration of a permit shall be for a period of not less than five years, and the permit shall be renewed for equivalent durations unless the city makes a finding that the small wireless facilities or the new or modified utility pole do not comply with the applicable city codes or any provision, condition or requirement contained in this article. 
If the Act is repealed as provided in Section 90 therein, renewals of permits shall be subject to the applicable City Code provisions or regulations in effect at the time of renewal. 
(7)  Means of submitting applications. Applicants shall submit applications, supporting information and notices to the city by personal delivery at the city's designated place of business, by regular mail postmarked on the date due or by any other commonly used means, including electronic mail. 
(c)  Collocation requirements and conditions. 
(1)  Public safety space reservation. The city may reserve space on municipal utility poles for future public safety uses, for the city's electric utility uses, or both, but a reservation of space may not preclude the collocation of a small wireless facility unless the city reasonably determines that the municipal utility pole cannot accommodate both uses. 
(2)  Installation and maintenance. The wireless provider shall install, maintain, repair and modify its small wireless facilities in safe condition and good repair and in compliance with the requirements and conditions of this article. The wireless provider shall ensure that its employees, agents or contracts that perform work in connection with its small wireless facilities are adequately trained and skilled in accordance with all applicable industry and governmental standards and regulations. 
(3)  No interference with public safety communication frequencies. The wireless provider's operation of the small wireless facilities shall not interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety communications. 
A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public safety agency's communications equipment. 
Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a public safety agency. 
If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the interference in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675. 
The city may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such interference if the wireless provider is not in compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations cited in the previous paragraph. Failure to remedy the interference as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance. 
(4)  The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless facilities on city utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric supply zone of the pole. 
However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may be located in the communications space on the city utility pole and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole. 
For purposes of this subparagraph, the terms "communications space," "communication worker safety zone, and "electric supply zone" have the meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. 
(5)  The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety. 
(6)  The wireless provider shall comply with written design standards that are generally applicable for decorative utility poles, or reasonable stealth, concealment and aesthetic requirements that are set forth in a city ordinance, written policy adopted by the city, a comprehensive plan or other written design plan that applies to other occupiers of the rights-of-way, including on a historic landmark or in a historic district. 
(7)  Alternate placements. Except as provided in this collocation requirements and conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required to collocation small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole, the city may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within 100 feet of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant. 
If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the city, the applicant shall provide written certification describing the property rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not satisfy the criteria in this paragraph. 
(8)  Height limitations. The maximum height of a small wireless facility shall be no more than ten feet above the utility pole or wireless support structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated. 
New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of: 
a.  Ten feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole, other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place on the date the application is submitted to the city, that is located within 300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the city, provided the city may designate which intersecting right-of-way within 300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height limitation for such facility; or 
b.  Forty-five feet above ground level. 
(9)  Height exceptions or variances. If an applicant proposes a height for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant shall apply for a special use permit in conformance with procedures, terms and conditions set forth in Article XV of the Zoning Ordinances of the city. 
(10)  Contractual design requirements. The wireless provider shall comply with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the city and a private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way. 
(11)  Ground-mounted equipment spacing. The wireless provider shall comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit granting of such exceptions or variances. 
(12)  Undergrounding regulations. The wireless provider shall comply with local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests to install such new utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the replacement of utility poles. 
(13)  Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which a permit is granted shall be completed within 180 days after issuance of the permit, unless the city and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within 60 days after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to complete installation does not exceed 360 days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the city grants an extension in writing to the applicant.

(a)  For the purposes of this section, the following words, as used herein, shall be construed to have the meaning herein set forth: 
(b)  Definition of "nuisance." For the purposes of this section, the term "nuisance" is defined to mean any condition or use of premises or of building exteriors which is detrimental to the property of others or which causes or tends to cause substantial diminution in the value of property in the neighborhood in which such premises are located. This includes, but is not limited to, the keeping or the depositing on, or the scattering over the premises of any of the following: 
(1)  Lumber, junk, trash or debris. 
(2)  Abandoned, discarded or unused objects or equipment such as, but not limited to, automobiles, furniture, stoves, refrigerators, freezers, cans, containers, motorcycles, motor or mini bikes, bicycles, toys, children's vehicles, clothing bedding, mowers or building materials of any type or quantity. 
(c)  Duty of maintenance of private property. No person owning, leasing, occupying or having charge of any premises (all of whom are hereinafter collectively referred to as "owners") shall maintain or keep any nuisance thereon, nor shall any such person keep or maintain such premises in a manner causing substantial diminution in the value of other property in the neighborhood in which such premises are located. 
(d)  Exterior storage of nonoperating vehicles prohibited. No person in charge or in control of premises, whether as owner, lessee, tenant, occupant or otherwise, shall allow any partially dismantled, wrecked, junked, discarded or otherwise nonoperating motor vehicle to remain on such property longer than ten days; and no person shall leave any such vehicle on any property within the city for a longer time than ten days except that this section shall not apply with regard to any vehicle in an enclosed building or so located upon the premises as not to be readily visible from any public place or from any surrounding private property. For the purposes herein, an "otherwise nonoperating motor vehicle" shall include any vehicle not displaying a valid registration license plate with sticker, that is not currently insured, or that is not operable under the provisions of the Illinois Motor Vehicle Code. This section shall further not apply with regard to any vehicle on the premises of a business enterprise operated in a lawful place, other than in a residential district, and operated in a lawful manner, when the keeping or maintenance of such vehicle is necessary to the operation of such business enterprise; or with regard to a vehicle in an appropriate storage place or depository maintained in a lawful place and manner by the city or any other public agency or entity. 
(e)  Penalty for failure of owner to abate such nuisance. If such owners allow said nuisance to exist or fail to abate said nuisance to exist or fail to abate said nuisance, they, and each of them, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not less than $25.00, nor more than $500.00 for each offense and a separate offense shall be deemed committed on each day during or on which such nuisance is permitted to exist. 
(f)  Abatement by city. Whenever said owners fail to abate said nuisance, then the city shall remove the said personalty to a location of its selection, the expenses therefor to be billed to said owners, jointly and severally, said bill to be recoverable in a suit at law. 
When said personalty has been removed and placed in storage by the city, as provided for herein, said personalty shall be sold by the city after the lapse of such time as is provided by law. If the proceeds of such sale are insufficient to pay the costs of abatement, said owners shall be liable to the city for the balance of the costs, jointly and severally, to be recoverable in a suit at law. If the proceeds are in excess of costs, the balance shall be paid to said owners, or deposited in the city treasury for their use. In the event the city is required to abate a nuisance, the owner shall be liable for all reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the city, which shall be added as costs. 
(g)  Enforcement. In addition to the other provisions for enforcement of this section, enforcement may be accomplished by the city in any manner authorized by law, and, in addition, any person who by reason of another's violation of any provision of this section, suffers special damage to himself different from that suffered by other property owners throughout the city generally may bring an action to enjoin or otherwise abate an existing violation.

    Before any permit for the drilling of any well or the laying of any pipeline shall be issued, a written application therefor, signed by the applicant or some duly authorized person in his behalf, shall be filed with the city clerk. Applications for the drilling of a well shall be made on forms to be provided by the city and shall state the block and exact lot or location thereon where the proposed well is to be drilled and there shall be attached thereto a map or plat of such block showing the lots contained therein and the dimensions thereof, and be accompanied by a statement setting forth the owners of the respective lots or parts of lots in such block, on which plat shall be shown the exact location of the well proposed to be drilled, which shall be near the center of such block if feasible.

Every such application for the laying of a pipeline across or along any of the streets, alleys, parkways or public grounds of said city shall set forth the name of the owner of such pipeline and the use or purpose to which the same shall be devoted, the size, beginning and terminus thereof and the depth at which the same is proposed to be laid, and the interference, if any, that is proposed or will be necessitated by such laying, with paved streets, sidewalks, parkways, telephone or lighting lines, water and gas mains, sewers, and other property of the city or, of any public utility. All applications shall be verified before an officer authorized to administer oaths. If it is made to appear, either by such application or by other satisfactory proof, that an applicant for permission to drill a well is the owner of, has under his control, either as owner or lessee, or both, all of the property within the block upon which it is proposed to drill such well, the permit may be granted for drilling such well without notice. If such applicant is not the owner of or does not have under his control for drilling purposes as owner or lessee, or both, all real estate, exclusive of streets and alleys in the block on which it is proposed to drill a well, and does not have the consent of all of the owners or lessees of real estate in such block, then before a permit is granted, such applicant shall after filing his application with the city clerk give not less than five days' notice of a hearing thereon to all persons interested in the real estate in such block, either as owners or as lessees, either by publishing a notice one time in a public newspaper, published in said city, or by posting notices thereof in not less than five public places within the city, one of which notices shall be posted at the city hall, one at the front door of the court house and two at public places within such block. Such notice shall fix the time and place for the hearing on such application on a Monday evening at the hour of 4:30 p.m. before the council, at one of its regular meetings and shall describe the block on which it is proposed to drill and the exact location of such well, and the name of the applicant.

(Ord. No. 371, § 1, 3-13-78) 
Sec. 161/2-5. - Number of permits. 
    Only one permit shall be granted to drill to each oil leasing stratum on a single block as defined in this Code, except in cases where it is made to appear to the council that an additional well or wells are necessary to properly protect real estate situated in any block against improper and unfair drainage from any well or wells on adjoining real estate, in which event the council may permit the drilling of such additional well or wells as may be necessary to prevent such improper and unfair drainage through wells on adjoining lands, provided that on blocks as herein defined that greatly exceed in size an area of 400 feet square, additional permits may be granted if necessary for the proper development of such blocks. This section shall not apply to the hydraulic reserve, and to outlying areas in the city that are not platted into city lots or blocks. 
(Ord. No. 371, § 1, 3-13-78) 
Sec. 161/2-6. - Permit to minority interest. 
    In the event that the owners of the major portion of the real estate or of the major portion of the leasehold interest covering the real estate, or both, in any one block shall not have applied for permission to drill a well on such block, then any owner of real estate or a leasehold interest less than a major interest therein may make application for a permit to drill a well on such block, on giving notice of a hearing on such application as hereinbefore provided. If at such hearing the owners of the major interest of real estate or leases or both in such block shall make application for a permit to drill on such block, permission shall be granted to the holders of such major interest, otherwise permission to drill may be granted by the council to any owner of real estate or of a leasehold interest covering real estate in such block, subject, however, to all of the other terms and conditions of this Code. 
(Ord. No. 371, § 1, 3-13-78) 
Sec. 161/2-7. - Insurance and bonds. 
    No permit for the drilling or putting down of any well shall be issued until the applicant shall have procured public liability insurance in an amount of not less than $50,000.00, and property damage insurance in an amount not less than $100,000.00, and filed certificates showing that such insurance has been obtained and is in force, with the city clerk, with each application for a drilling permit on a block; provided that in such portions of the city where it is unlikely that property damage may result the council may reduce the amount of such property damage bond below the amount above specified. No permit shall issue to drill a well or lay a pipeline until the applicant shall have filed with the city clerk a bond running to the city in a penal sum of not less than $5,000.00, conditioned that such applicant shall abide by and comply with all of the provisions of this Code and shall save and keep harmless the said city against any claims and demands of any nature whatsoever that may be made against it arising out of the operations of said applicant, and that the permittee will in all respects comply with the provisions of section 161/2-15 of this Code. 
    All such bonds shall be signed as surety by a bonding or indemnity company authorized to do business in the state and shall be approved by the council. All such bonds shall be kept in full force and effect during the operations of the permittee and certificates showing that such insurance is in effect shall be kept on file with the city clerk. 
(Ord. No. 371, § 1, 3-13-78) 
Sec. 161/2-8. - Participation by owners. 
    In case the whole of the real estate in any block is covered by leases held by any permittee, such leases shall be deemed to have been unitized, and each owner of real estate in such block shall participate in the royalty interest in oil or gas produced from any well or wells drilled on such block in the proportion that the area owned by each such owner bears to the entire area of such block exclusive of streets and alleys. 
    Owners of real estate in any block who have not made a lease shall be entitled to receive as royalty out of any well or wells drilled on such block such proportion of the average royalty, which shall not be less than one-eighth of the total production, reserved in the leases held by the permittee in such block as the area owned by such non-leasing owner bears to the entire area of such block, exclusive of streets and alleys. 
    Any owner of real estate in any block who may have leased to a lessee other than the permittee shall be entitled to receive as royalty out of any well or wells drilled on such block such proportion, as determined by the royalty reserved in the lease of such owner of the products of such well or wells, as the area owned by such owner bears to the entire area of such block, exclusive of streets and alleys, provided that the royalty reserved in the lease of such owner shall not be greater than the then prevailing and customary royalty in said field. 
    The elections of owners under the provisions of this section shall be exercised by filing the same in writing with the city clerk, and delivering or mailing a copy thereof to the permittee operating on the block in which the real estate of such owner is located. 
(Ord. No. 371, § 1, 3-13-78) 
Sec. 161/2-9. - Participation by lessee. 
    Any lessee holding a lease or leases covering part of a block on which a permit to drill a well shall have been granted to some other person by the council or any owner of real estate in such block who has not made a lease on his real estate in such block may elect to participate in the proportion that the area of such lessee or owner bears to the area of such block, exclusive of streets and alleys, in the working interest in the well or wells drilled or to be drilled on such block by the person to whom a permit has been granted to drill on such block under the provisions of this Code by complying with the following conditions, by the person so desiring to participate: 
(a)  Notice of such election to participate shall be given by the person so desiring to participate by filing a written election with the city clerk, and serving a copy thereof on such permittee either in person or by mailing a copy thereof by registered mail to the post office address of such permittee. 
(b)  The permittee shall give any prospective participant who has given notice of intention to participate an itemized statement of the amount expended by him in drilling and equipping the well or wells on such block, and shall permit examination of his records by such prospective participant to verify the correctness of such statement. If the permittee and the participant are unable to agree upon the amount to be contributed by such participant, the amount shall be determined by arbitration or by appropriate court proceedings. The amount the person so electing to participate shall be required to pay the permittee shall be an amount equal to such proportionate part of the amount expended up to that time by such permittee in the drilling of a well or wells on such block and in equipping the same for the production of oil or gas, exclusive of any amount that may have been paid by such permittee for any lease or leases in such block held by him, and exclusive of all operating costs, as the area in such block owned or held under lease by the person so desiring to participate bears to the entire area of such block, exclusive of streets and alleys. 
Within ten days after the amount the person so electing to participate has been determined, such person so electing to participate shall pay or tender such amount to such permittee, if he can be found by a reasonable effort, and if he cannot be found, then by placing the same in the hands of the treasurer of the city for the use and benefit of such permittee.

(Ord. No. 371, § 1, 3-13-78) 
Sec. 161/2-10. - Mandatory election to participate. 
(a)  Any permittee to whom a drilling permit has been granted, who does not hold leases covering the entire block on which he has been granted a permit to drill a well, may, if he so elects, at any time before the completion of such well, require the owner or owners of the unleased portion and/or of the underlying oil and gas of such block, and/or the holder or holders of leases on the portion of such block not covered by leases held by such permittee, to exercise his or their rights to elect whether or not he or they will participate in the cost of the development of such block and the future operation thereof for the production of oil and gas therefrom in the manner following: 
(1)  Such permittee shall file with the city clerk a written instrument signed by him or his duly authorized agent, stating such election and setting forth in detail the block on which he has been granted a permit to drill and the exact location of the well he proposes to drill thereon, and the depth or formation to which such permittee proposes to drill such well, which instrument shall be accompanied by sworn or certified copies of the leases held by him in such block, and a certificate of some competent abstracter of titles showing the ownership of the fee title, and of the underlying oil and gas and of leasehold interests, on the portion of such block on which permittee does not hold leases. Said instrument of election shall also be accompanied by a sworn statement setting forth the post office address of all of the fee owners and of underlying oil and gas, and the owners of leasehold interests as set forth in said abstracters certificate, if known, and if any such address cannot be ascertained by making diligent inquiry, said sworn statement shall so state and shall give the last known address of such person or persons. 
(2)  Upon the filing of said written election with the accompaniments as aforesaid, the mayor of the city shall by written endorsement thereon, set a date for a hearing thereon, on some date not less than seven days thereafter. Upon such date of hearing being fixed, the permittee shall cause a written notice of such hearing to be served upon each person so named in said abstracter's certificate and sworn statement of addresses whose post office address is given either in person, or by registered mail, such notice to be served or mailed at least five days before the date of such hearing. In case the post office address of any of such owners or lessees is unknown, a notice giving the time, place and purpose of such hearing addressed to such person or persons whose address is unknown, shall be published not less than five days before such date of hearing, at least one time in a public newspaper of general circulation published in the city, and a copy thereof sent by United States mail to the last known address of such owner or lessee as set forth in the sworn statement hereinbefore mentioned. Proof of such serving and mailing of notices shall be made by the affidavit of the person so serving or mailing the same, and proof of publication shall be made by the certificate of the publisher of the paper in which the notice was published. Such affidavit and certificate shall be filed with the city clerk on or before the date fixed for such hearing. If notice of such hearing shall not have been so given, such hearing may be continued by the mayor or council of the city from time to time until notice shall have been given to the interested parties as hereinbefore required. 
(3)  On the date fixed for such hearing, or on such later date to which such hearing may have been continued, the council of the city shall conduct a hearing thereon. On or before the date of such hearing any owner of real estate in such block on which the permittee does not hold a lease or of oil and gas underlying the same, or any holder of a lease on any real estate in such block on which permittee does not hold a lease, if such owner or lessee desires to participate as a leasehold owner in the well proposed to be or being drilled by the permittee, file his election in writing to so participate, in which he shall set forth the area in square feet and a full description of the real estate owned by him or on which he has a lease or leases, or under which he owns the oil and gas in such block, a sworn or certified copy of such lease or leases or conveyance of the underlying oil and gas shall accompany such written election. The permittee shall, not less than two days before such hearing, file with the city clerk a sworn, itemized estimate of the total cost of drilling and equipping the well proposed to be drilled on such block by the permittee. The cost of drilling and of equipping shall be set up separately in such estimate. The person or persons so desiring to participate may severally accept said estimate as correct by filing their written acceptance thereof with the city clerk, or if they are not willing to so accept the same, and are unable to agree with the permittee as to the amount of such estimated cost, then such question of estimated cost shall be by the council referred to three arbitrators, whose fee shall be $25.00 each, and shall be paid by the permittee. One of said arbitrators shall be selected by the permittee and one by the person or persons so electing to participate, which two shall select a third arbitrator. If the parties are unable or fail to so select arbitrators the council may appoint them. The decision of said board of arbitrators shall be filed with the city clerk and shall be final. Within five days after said estimate of cost being so determined, either by acceptance, agreement or by arbitrators, and the filing of the same with the city clerk, the person or persons who have so elected to participate shall pay to the treasurer of the city such proportionate part of such estimated cost as the area owned or held under lease, or under which the oil and gas is owned by such person or persons bears to the area of the block in which such well is proposed to be or is being drilled, exclusive of streets and alleys. Such participant shall also, within the same time, file with the city clerk a bond running to the permittee, executed by a surety company authorized to do a surety business in the state, in an amount not less than one and one-fourth (11/4) times the proportionate part of such estimated cost of said well that such participant is required to pay hereunder, conditioned that said participant will pay to the permittee, his heirs, executors, administrators or assigns, his proportion of the cost of the future development of said block for the production of oil and gas and the cost of future operation and maintenance thereof. 
(4)  If the well so drilled by the permittee is not drilled to the maximum depth specified in the statement filed by the permittee hereunder, the participant or participants shall be entitled to a rebate out of the amount so deposited by him or them to cover drilling costs, with the city treasurer in such proportion as the total actual depth of such well bears to the total depth as set forth in the estimated cost, and if such well is not productive, and is not equipped by the permittee, then the amount so deposited by such participant or participants to cover equipment shall be refunded to him or them. If the permittee completes such well, either as a producer, or as a dry hole, he shall be entitled to have paid to him the amounts so deposited with the city treasurer by the participant or participants, subject to rebates or refunds to the participants as hereinbefore set forth. The city treasurer shall accept as conclusive evidence of the depth to which a well is drilled the affidavit of the contractor drilling such well, or a sworn statement of a disinterested party who has measured its depth, or a certified or sworn copy of an electrical log reading of such well extending to the bottom of such well. 
(5)  The permittee for any block shall have the right to develop and operate such block for oil and gas, to the exclusion of all owners of real estate or other holders of leases, or participants, being accountable to them, however, for such interest in the production from such block to which they are respectively entitled under this Code. The permittee shall have a lien on the share of such production of any participant who fails to make payment of any sum or sums that may become due from him or them to the permittee under the terms of this or any other section of this Code or otherwise. 
(6)  If permittee after production is found fails, refuses or neglects to complete such well, or to equip the same, or at any time abandons the same, then the participant or participants under section 161/2-9 or 161/2-10 of this Code shall have the right to and may take over the working interest in such block, and thereafter develop and operate the same and permittee shall have no further interest therein. 
(7)  Any owner or owners of the fee or of the underlying oil in any block, or any holder or holders of an oil and gas lease or leases in any block, who, after proceedings shall have been had under the provision of this section by the permittee to require him or them to exercise his right to participate in the leasehold interest in such block, shall fail to avail himself or themselves of the right to so participate, shall thereafter have no right to participate in such leasehold interest under section 161/2-9 of this Code, or otherwise, and shall have no share in the oil and gas or either produced by the permittee in such block that belongs to the working of leasehold interest. 
(8)  Any participant under this section or under section 161/2-9 of this Code shall by himself, or his agent appointed in writing, during business hours and in the presence of the permittee, have access to the records of such permittee pertaining to the cost of development and operation by the permittee on such block, the amount of production therefrom, and the proceeds derived from sale of oil and gas, or either, therefrom, which records shall be kept by permittee and shall be available at some place in the city. 
(9)  All bonds required by this or any other section of this Code shall be kept constantly in force by the party required to furnish the same; a failure so to do shall be ground for suspension of such rights under this Code of the person under obligation to furnish the same, until such bond requirements are met by such person.

(a)  All applicants for permit to drill a well shall pay to the city clerk, at the time of making such application, the sum of $100.00 as a fee to apply on the cost and expense of the administration of this Code, of which amount the sum of $75.00 shall be refunded if the application is not granted. All applicants for permits to lay a pipeline longitudinally along any street or alley shall pay at the time of making such application a fee of $0.25 per rod, but in no event less than $10.00 to cover the cost of expense of the administration of this Code, of which amount 75 percent shall be refunded if the application is not granted, provided that no permit shall be required to cross an alley within the block on which a permittee is drilling or operating a well. 
(b)  In addition to the above, any applicant, person, firm or corporation obtaining a permit to drill a well shall pay an additional fee of 1/32 of 7/8 overriding royalty of the production from said well, and this section shall be authority for the purchaser of oil and gas produced from any well to pay to the city 1/32 of 7/8 of the production as a continuing fee. Should the oil and gas purchaser not consider this sufficient authority, then in that event, the acceptance of a permit to drill a well shall automatically obligate the lessee or his assigns to execute any instrument necessary, such that the city shall receive a 1/32 of 7/8 overriding royalty of the production from the well. The overriding royalty shall apply only to oil and gas leases executed after the effective date of this amendment. 
(Ord. No. 371, § 1, 3-13-78; Ord. No. 672, 5-19-97) 
Sec. 16-12. - Annual fee. 
(a)  On or before the fifteenth day of April of each year, the owner of each producing oil well in the corporate limits of the city, which well was completed before the first day of such year, shall pay to the city an annual fee, to cover the cost of administering this Code, based upon the average daily production of such well during the months of January, February and March of such year, as follows: 
(1)  For wells from which the average daily production for such period was in excess of ten barrels, the sum of $50.00. 
(2)  For wells from which the average daily production for such period was not in excess of ten barrels and more than six barrels, the sum of $25.00. 
(3)  For wells from which the average daily production for such period was six barrels or less, the sum of $10.00. 
(b)  Each such owner shall file with the city clerk a sworn statement by some person having knowledge of the facts, or a copy for the runs from such well, furnished by the purchaser of the oil from such well, showing the production from such well for such three-month period, which shall be taken as evidence of such production, and shall be taken as the basis. 
(c)  Each owner of a pipeline laid upon, along or across any public street, alley or public way in the city shall, on or before the fifteenth day of April of each year, so long as such pipeline remains, pay to the city at the rate of $0.10 per rod for the amount of pipe so owned by such owner, to apply on the expense of administering this Code. The city may cancel the permit of any pipeline owner to maintain his pipeline who fails to pay such amounts at or before the time the same becomes due by giving five days written notice to such owner of his agent, served either in person or by United States mail.

(h)  Enforcement. Nothing in this section 20-69 shall be construed as limiting any additional or further remedies that the city may have for enforcement of this section. 
(i)  Waiver and fee implementation. 
(1)  The city hereby waives all fees, charges and other compensation that may accrue, after the effective date of the waiver, to the city by a telecommunications retailer pursuant to any existing city franchise, license or similar agreement with a telecommunications retailer during the time the city imposes the telecommunications infrastructure maintenance fee. This waiver shall only be effective during the time the infrastructure maintenance fee provided for in this article is subject to being lawfully imposed on the telecommunications retailer and collected by the telecommunications retailer from the customer. 
(2)  The city clerk shall send a notice of the waiver by certified mail/return receipt requested to each telecommunications retailer with whom the city has a franchise. 
(3)  The city infrastructure maintenance fee provided for in this section shall become effective and imposed on the first day of the month not less than 90 days after the city provides written notice by certified mail to each telecommunications retailer with whom the city has an existing franchise, license or similar agreement that the city waives all compensation under such existing franchise, license or similar agreement during such time as the fee is subject to being lawfully imposed and collected by the retailer and remitted to the city.

DIVISION 3. - WASTEWATER TREATMENT SERVICE CHARGES; INDUSTRIAL WASTE COST RECOVERY 

Sec. 21-86. - Wastewater service charges. 
(a)  Basis for wastewater service charges: The wastewater service charge for the use of and for service supplied by the wastewater facilities of the city shall consist of a basic user charge for operation and maintenance plus replacement, a debt service charge and surcharge, if applicable. 
    The "debt service charge" shall be computed by dividing the annual debt service of all outstanding revenue bonds by the number of users. Through further divisions, the monthly and quarterly debt service charges can be computed. 
    The "basic user charge" shall be based on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters for wastes having the following normal concentrations: 
(1)  A five-day, twenty-degree centigrade biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of 200 mg/l. 
(2)  A suspended solids (SS) content of 250 mg/l. 
    It shall consist of operation and maintenance costs plus replacement and shall be computed as follows: 
(1)  Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and maintain the wastewater facilities including a replacement fund for the year, for all works categories. 
(2)  Proportion the estimated costs to wastewater facility categories by volume, suspended solids and BOD. 
(3)  Estimate wastewater volume, pounds of SS and pounds of BOD to be treated. 
(4)  Proportion the estimated costs to nonindustrial and industrial users by volume, suspended solids and BOD. 
(5)  Compute costs per 1,000 gallons for normal sewage strength. 
(6)  Compute surcharge costs per 1,000 gallons per mg/l in excess of normal sewage strength for BOD and SS. 
    A "surcharge" will be levied to all users whose waters exceed the normal concentrations for BOD (200 mg/l) and SS (250 mg/l). 
    The surcharge will be based on water usage as recorded by water meters and/or sewage meters for all wastes which exceed the 200 mg/l and 250 mg/l concentrations for BOD and SS respectively. Paragraph (f) specifies the procedures to compute a surcharge. 
    The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall be reviewed annually by certified public accountants for the city in their annual audit report. The wastewater service charge shall be revised periodically to reflect a change in debt service or a change in operation and maintenance costs including replacement costs. 
(b)  Measurement of flow: The volume of flow used for computing basic user charges and surcharges shall be the metered water consumption read to the lowest even increments of 100 gallons. 
(1)  If the person discharging wastes into the public sewers procures any part, or all, of his water from sources other than the public waterworks system, all or a part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the person shall install and maintain, at his expense, water meters of a type approved by the city superintendent for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from these other sources. 
(2)  Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required by the city superintendent if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from the metered water consumption records. 
(3)  Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be installed, owned and maintained by the person. 
    Following approval and installation, such meters may not be removed, unless service is canceled, without the consent of the city superintendent.

Every rule or regulation, every amendment or repeal thereof, and every order, requirement, decision or determination of the board and shall be filed immediately in the office of the board and shall be a public record. The board shall adopt its own rules of procedure not in conflict with this ordinance or with the Illinois Statutes in such case made and provided, and may select or appoint such officers as it deems necessary.

A.  To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged that there is error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the building inspector in the enforcement of this ordinance. 
B.  To hold public hearings on and, when in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this ordinance, to recommend to the city council the authorization of the following exceptions to the terms thereof: 
1.  The extension of a district where the boundary line thereof divides a lot in a single ownership at the time of the passage of this ordinance. 
2.  Interpretation of the provisions of this ordinance in such a way as to carry out the intent and purpose of the plan, as shown upon the district map, where the street layout actually on ground varies from the street layout as shown on the map. 
3.  The use of a temporary building in conjunction with construction work only, which temporary building shall be removed promptly upon completion of the construction work. 
4.  The reconstruction of a nonconforming building which has been damaged by explosion, fire, act of God or the public enemy, to the extent of more than 50 per cent of its fair market value, where the board finds such compelling necessity requiring a continuance of the nonconforming use and the primary purpose of continuing the nonconforming use is not to continue a monopoly. 
5.  Variation of the parking and loading regulations where it is conclusively shown that the specific use of a building would make necessary the parking and loading spaces otherwise required by this ordinance. 
6.  The classification of commercial or industrial uses not specifically listed in the ordinance as to the appropriate district therefor based on the general character of the use and its comparability with other uses specifically permitted in the district. 
C.

The building inspector shall forthwith transmit to the board all of the papers, constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken. A fee of ten dollars shall accompany all notices of appeals, such fee will be refunded if the appeal is successful. 
    An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the building inspector certifies to the board of appeals after the notice of appeal has been filed with him that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case the proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the board of appeals or by a court of record. 
    The board shall fix a reasonable time and place for the hearing of the appeal and give due notice of time, place and purpose thereof to the parties and shall render a decision on the appeal without unreasonable delay.
