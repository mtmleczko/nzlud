PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Bradenton, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1971 Code, as supplemented through May 11, 1994, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1971 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Supervising Editor, and Charles Vignos, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Carl Callahan, City Clerk and Treasurer, and William Lisch, City Attorney, and the other members of the city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(Laws of Fla., ch. 79-427, § 1) 
Sec. 2. - Statement of policy and legislative findings. 
(1)  It is the policy of the state to make it possible for the City to revitalize and preserve property values and prevent deterioration in the downtown area by a system of self-help to correct the blight of such deterioration which has developed there. The authority hereby created is intended to provide a vehicle whereby property owners who will benefit directly from the results of such a program will bear the substantial cost thereof and thereby local problems may be solved on the local level through the use of machinery provided by local government. 
(2)  The legislature hereby finds and declares that the downtown area is a blighted area and that portions therein are slums. The area constitutes an economic and social liability imposing onerous municipal burdens which decrease the tax base and reduce tax revenues, substantially impair or arrest the sound growth of said area, retards the provision of housing accommodations, aggravates traffic problems and substantially impairs or arrests the elimination of traffic hazards and the improvement of traffic facilities; that the prevention and elimination of such slums and blight is a matter of public policy and concern. 
(3)  It is further found and declared that certain portions of the slums and blighted areas require acquisition, clearance and disposition subject to use restrictions, as provided in this act, since the prevailing conditions of deterioration and obsolescence makes impracticable the reclamation thereof by conservation or rehabilitation; that other portions of the downtown may, through the means provided in this act be susceptible of conservation or rehabilitation in such a manner and the conditions hereinbefore enumerated may be eliminated, remedied or prevented; and that salvage, slum and blighted areas can be conserved and rehabilitated through appropriate public action as herein authorized, and the cooperation and voluntary action of the owners and tenants of the property in such area. 
(4)  Among the many causes of such slums and blight are the following: Automobile traffic flow is strangled by outmoded street patterns, proliferation of uncoordinated uses and parking areas, unsuitable topography, faulty lot layouts, fragmentation of land uses and parking areas necessitating frequent automobile movement, lack of separation of pedestrian areas from auto traffic, low level access bridge, air pollution, and excessive noise levels from strangled auto traffic. Voluntary cooperation for coordinated development is impracticable because of fragmentary ownership, distant absentee ownership and unusual conditions of title and other conditions. 
(5)  The area is a business ghetto plagued with vacant and deteriorating buildings which are neglected and produce a depressing atmosphere. Many businesses of all types have left the area for new locations in suburban shopping centers and few businesses have entered to take their places. The oldest commercial structures in the City are in this area and they are obsolete, of inferior construction and incompatible with modern functional design as is featured in competitive shopping centers. 
(6)  The area now has few residences and most of the residences would not be permitted for new construction under the city's building code. Many former residents have left the area and few suitable residence facilities exist. The area is predominantly commercial and is occupied primarily by day workers who sleep in suburban homes outside the downtown area. 
(7)  The only effective device for removal of the slums and blight of the downtown area is the planning and implementation of planning for appropriate land use, beautification, continuity of planning and aesthetic and technical design concepts, the removal of deteriorated and obsolescent structures and the reduction of fragmentary control of properties in the area. To implement such plans requires the exercise of the power of eminent domain so as to assemble land in pursuance of a coordinated program for redevelopment, as authorized by this act; all of which is declared to be a public purpose and a public use. 
(8)  The legislature further finds and declares that the provisions of this act and the powers afforded to the governing board of the authority are essential to guide and accomplish the coordinated, balanced and harmonious development of the downtown in accordance with existing and future needs, to promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the area and its inhabitants, visitors, property owners, and workers, to establish, maintain and preserve aesthetic values and preserve and foster the development and display of attractiveness, to prevent overcrowding and congestion, to regulate auto traffic and provide pedestrian safety, to secure safety from fire, storm, and other dangers and to conserve and provide adequate light and air and to provide a way of life which combines the conveniences and amenities of modern living with the traditions and pleasures of the past. 
Sec. 3. - Creation of authority. 
    There is hereby created and established the downtown development authority, which authority shall have all the powers herein provided, and which shall be a body corporate as well as politic, with power to sue and be sued in all the courts of this state; with power to adopt and use a corporate seal. 
Sec. 4. - Board; membership, appointment, term of office.

    Pursuant to notice and an opportunity to be heard, an appointed member of the board may be removed for cause by the city council. Any such removal shall be subject to judicial review as provided by general law.

(a)  Whenever the board wishes to secure the approval of the electors for the purpose of authorizing an ad valorem tax either for operational purposes, or to provide debt service on bonds or other debt obligations, or whenever the board deems that a referendum is desirable for the proper administration of the authority, a resolution shall be adopted setting out the purpose of the referendum, the question to be put before the electors, the proposed millage to be levied for operational purposes, and the value and purpose of bonds or other debt obligations to be issued, when such obligations are to be financed by an ad valorem tax, and the date on which the ballots are to be mailed to the electors as provided in paragraph (d) of subsection (2) of this section. A copy of the resolution shall be immediately transmitted to the supervisor. 
(b)  Within forty-five (45) days after the effective date of this amended section, and within forty-five (45) days after the adoption of the resolution referred to in paragraph (a), the supervisor shall compile a list of names, and the last-known addresses of the freeholder electors from the public records of Manatee County, Florida, and shall compile a list of the names, and the last-known addresses of the resident electors from the Manatee County supervisor [of] election's registration roll. The lists of freeholder electors and resident electors so prepared shall constitute all electors qualified to vote in any referendum called by the board, except as hereinafter provided. 
(c)  Fourteen (14) days prior to the date that the ballots are to be mailed to the electors, but no more than sixty (60) days after receipt of the resolution, the supervisor shall mail to each elector a notice of the referendum. Such notice shall state the date the ballots are to be mailed, that all ballots must be returned to the supervisor within ten (10) days of their date of mailing, and the question to be put before the electors, including the millage of any proposed ad valorem tax, and the value and purpose of bonds or other debt obligations proposed to be issued if they are to be financed by an ad valorem tax. 
(d)  The ballots shall be mailed on the date provided in the resolution adopted by the board under the provisions of paragraph (a). The ballot shall comply with the law and all appropriate regulations of the department of state, relating to mailing and tabulation of absentee ballots. The supervisor shall include with the ballot a stamped, addressed envelope for return of the ballot to the supervisor. 
(e)  The supervisor shall begin his tabulation of the referendum on the day following the required date of return of the ballots and shall certify the results to the board. The board shall meet upon receipt of such certification and shall canvass the results and declare the vote of the referendum. 
(f)  Any person entitled to vote in such a referendum whose name does not appear on the list of electors may register with the supervisor. The registration list shall remain open until fourteen (14) days after the notification provided in paragraph (c). 
(g)  Corporations or other artificial legal entities which own property within the district shall designate a voting representative no less than one week prior to any referendum in the manner to be prescribed by the supervisor. Such corporation or artificial legal entity shall vote only through its designated representative. 
(h)  For the purpose of this act, one (1) vote shall be allowed for each person who is a freeholder elector or resident elector. In the event that any freeholder elector is also a resident elector, such person shall be entitled to only one (1) vote even though he may be classified in each category. Any freeholder elector who is the owner of any freehold interest in more than one (1) parcel of real property in the downtown area shall nevertheless be entitled to only one (1) vote. 
(i)  The elections to be held under this act shall be held in accordance with the Florida Election Code. 
(3)  A referendum shall be deemed approved when the majority of those voting in such referendum approve it. 
(4)  A referendum may be held to determine if electors residing on or owning lands contiguous to the downtown area desire that such territory be included under this act. The authority may submit the question of whether such territory should be included in the downtown area and whether such territory shall be included for tax purposes to the electors of the territory proposed to be added. 
(Laws of Fla., ch. 79-427, § 2) 
Sec. 11. - Ad valorem tax levy. 
(1)  The authority may authorize an ad valorem tax for: 
(a)  Operational purposes, or 
(b)  Debt service on bonds or other obligations to be levied on the taxable real and tangible personal property located in the downtown area when such tax has been approved in a referendum as provided for in section 10. Such tax shall be levied by the city council at the time and according to the procedure for the levy of ad valorem taxes by the city, and shall be at the millage approved in the referendum or as required to provide debt service on bonds or other obligations approved in the referendum. The tax shall be collected by the tax collector of Manatee County and paid to the authority as provided for by general law for the collection and distribution of ad valorem taxes by special taxing districts. Such taxes shall be used for no purposes other than as approved in the referendum and authorized by the board, pursuant to vouchers signed by the director and treasurer of the authority. 
(2)  The Bradenton Downtown Development Authority is hereby granted all of the powers necessary to operate as a special taxing district, it being the finding of the legislature that, subject to the approval of the electors, the levying of ad valorem taxes for carrying out the objectives of this act constitutes a valid public purpose. 
Sec. 12. - Preparation of budget. 
    The director shall prepare and submit for the approval of the board a budget for the operation of the authority for the next fiscal year. The budget shall conform to the fiscal year of the city and shall contain the information required of all city departments. After approval by the board, a copy of the budget shall be delivered to the city by the director with a statement of the millage required therefor as approved by the referendum, or as necessary to provide debt service on obligations approved by referendum. Such millage shall not exceed the limits fixed by law and by referendum. The operations of the authority shall be financed from any lawful source including the following sources: 
(1)  Moneys borrowed and to be repaid from other funds received under the authority of this act. 
(2)  Donations and contributions to the authority for the performance of its functions from any source public or private. 
(3)  Revenues from the rental, operation or sale of assets, facilities and projects of the authority. 
(4)  Proceeds of special assessments and an ad valorem tax on property in the downtown area. 
Sec. 13. - Bonds. 
    The board is authorized and empowered in order to provide for and carry out the work of this act, to raise funds by the issuance of bonds of the same types and in the same manner with the same power and authority and subject to the same limitations as is now provided by statute for the issuance of bonds by the city; provided that the board and its staff and agents shall perform all of the governmental functions to be done with regard to the bonds. The aggregate amount of the bonded indebtedness shall at no time exceed eighteen per cent (18%) of the assessed valuation of the taxable property in the downtown area at the time of issuance. The term of the bonds may extend beyond the life of the authority if the city shall have agreed to service and pay the bonds after the expiration of the authority. In that event, after the authority expires, the city shall continue to levy and collect the same special assessment tax which is authorized by this law to be levied and collected for the authority on ad valorem taxes authorized by referendum to be levied and collected for the authority, and use the revenues therefrom for the retirement of the bonds and expense necessary in connection with servicing the bonds until the bonds are retired. Any excess tax revenues remaining after retirement of the bonds shall be transferred to the general revenue fund of the city and such special tax shall not be levied in any subsequent year. 
Sec. 14. - Eminent domain. 
    The board shall have the right to acquire by condemnation any interest in real property, including a fee simple title thereto, which it may deem necessary for the action of the authority or for the performance of its lawful functions under this act. Said authority may exercise the power of eminent domain in the manner provided in F.S. chs. 73 and 74, and acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto, or it may exercise the power of eminent domain in the manner now or which may be hereafter provided by any other statutory provision for the exercise of the power of eminent domain. Property already devoted to a public use may be acquired in like manner. Provided that no real property belonging to the state, or any political subdivision thereof, may be acquired without its consent. 
Sec. 15. - Assessable improvements; levy and payment of special assessments; assessment bonds and certificates. 
    The authority may provide for the construction or reconstruction of assessable improvements, and for the levying of special assessments upon benefited property for the payment thereof, under the provisions of this section. 
(1)  The initial proceeding under this section shall be the passage by the board of a resolution ordering the construction or reconstruction of such assessable improvements, indicating the location by terminal points, routes or otherwise, and either giving a description of the improvements by their material, nature, character and size or giving two (2) or more descriptions with the directions that the material, nature, character and size shall be subsequently determined in conformity with one of such descriptions. Assessable improvements need not be continuous and may be in more than one locality or street. The resolution ordering any such improvement may give any short and convenient designation to each improvement ordered thereby, and the property against which assessments are to be made for the cost of such improvements may be designated as an assessment district, followed by a letter or number or name to distinguish it from the other assessment districts, after which it shall be sufficient to refer to such improvement and property by such designation in all proceedings and assessments, except in the notices required by this section. 
(2)  As soon as possible after the passage of such resolution the director shall prepare or cause to be prepared in duplicate plans and specifications for each improvement ordered thereby and an estimate of the cost thereof. Such cost shall include in addition to the items of cost as defined in this act, the cost of relaying streets, sidewalks and other public facilities or conveniences necessarily torn up or damaged and the following items of incidental expenses: 
(a)  Printing and publishing notices and proceedings; 
(b)  Costs of abstracts of title; and 
(c)  Any other expense necessary or proper in conducting the proceedings and work provided for in this section, including the estimated amount of discount, if any, upon the sale of assessment bonds or any other obligations issued hereunder for which such special assessments are to be pledged. If the resolution shall provide alternative descriptions of material, nature, character and size, such estimate shall include an estimate of the cost of the improvement of each such description. 
The director shall also prepare or cause to be prepared in duplicate a tentative apportionment of the estimated total cost of the improvement as between the district and each lot or parcel of land subject to special assessment under the resolution, such apportionment to be made in accordance with the provisions of the resolution and in relation to apportionment of cost provided herein for the preliminary assessment roll. Such tentative apportionment of total estimated cost shall not be held to limit or restrict the duties of the director in the preparation of such preliminary assessment roll. One of the duplicates of such plans, specifications and estimates and such tentative apportionment shall be filed with the board and the other duplicate shall be retained by the director in his files all thereof to remain open to public inspection. In performing the duties of assessment and apportionment of costs the director may employ and utilize such technical consultants as may be necessary, including but not limited to engineers, architects, planners, economists and appraisers. 
(3)  The board upon the filing with it of such plans, specifications, estimates and tentative apportionment of cost shall publish once in a newspaper or newspapers published or of general circulation in the downtown [area] a notice stating that at a meeting of the board on a certain day and hour, not earlier than fifteen (15) days from such publication, the board will hear objections of all interested persons to the confirmation of such resolution, which notice shall state in brief and general terms a description of the proposed assessable improvements with the location thereof, and shall also state that plans, specifications, estimates and tentative apportionment of cost thereof are on file with the board. The board shall keep a record in which shall be inscribed, at the request of any person, firm or corporation having or claiming to have any interest in any lot or parcel of land or property, the name and post office address of such person, firm or corporation, together with a brief description or designation of such lot or parcel, and it shall be the duty of the board to mail a copy of such notice to such person, firm or corporation at such address, at least ten (10) days before the time for the hearing as stated in such notice, but the failure of the board to keep such record or so to inscribe any name or address or to mail any such notice shall not constitute a valid objection to holding the hearing as provided in this section or to any other action taken under the authority of this section. 
(4)  At the time named in such notice, or to which an adjournment may be taken by the board, the board shall receive any objections of interested persons and may then or thereafter repeal or confirm such resolution with such amendments, if any, as may be desired by the board and which do not cause any additional property to be specifically assessed. 
(5)  All objections to any such resolution on the ground that it contained items which cannot be properly assessed against property, or that it is, for any default or defect in the passage or character of the resolution or the plans or specifications or estimate, void or voidable in whole or in part, or that it exceeds the power of the board, shall be made in writing in person or by attorney, and filed with the board at or before the time or adjourned time of such hearing. Any objections against the making of any assessable improvements not so made shall be considered as waived, and if any objection shall be made and overruled or shall not be sustained, the confirmation of the resolution shall be the final adjudication of the issues presented unless proper steps shall be taken in the court system as prescribed by general law. 
(6)  Whenever any resolution providing for the construction or reconstruction of assessable improvements and for the levying of special assessments upon benefited property for the payment thereof shall have been confirmed, as hereinabove provided, or at any time thereafter, the board may issue assessment bonds payable out of such assessments when collected. Said bonds shall mature not later than two (2) years after the last installment in which said special assessments may be paid, as provided in subsection (10), and may bear interest. Such assessment bonds shall be executed, shall have such provisions for redemption prior to maturity, shall be sold in the manner and be subject to all of the applicable provisions contained in this act for revenue bonds, except as the same are inconsistent with the provisions of this section. The amount of such assessment bonds for any assessable improvement, after the confirmation of the initial resolution, shall not exceed eighty per cent (80%) of the estimated amount of the cost of such assessable improvements which are to be specially assessed against the land or property to be specially benefited thereby, as shown in the estimates of the director for the authority referred to in subsection (2). The amount of such assessment bonds for any assessable improvement to be issued, after the confirmation of the preliminary assessment roll provided for in subsection (9), including any assessment bonds theretofore issued, shall not exceed the amount of special assessments actually confirmed and levied by the board as provided in subsection (9). 
Such assessment bonds shall be payable from the proceeds of the special assessments levied for the assessable improvement for which such assessment bonds are issued; provided, however, that the director may pledge the full faith and credit of the authority for the payment of the principal of and interest on such assessment bonds if the issuance of such assessment bonds shall be approved in the manner provided by law. 
(7)  After the passage of the resolution authorizing the construction or reconstruction of assessable improvements has been confirmed as provided in subsection (4), the authority may proceed with the construction or reconstruction work in accordance with the provisions of this act. Promptly after the completion of the work, the director for the authority, who is hereby designated as the official of the authority to make preliminary assessment of benefits from assessable improvements, shall prepare a preliminary assessment roll and file the same with the board, which roll shall contain the following: 
(a)  A description of the lots and parcels of land or property within the authority which will benefit from such assessable improvements and the amount of such benefits to each such lot or parcel of land or property, and the preliminary assessment. Such lots and parcels shall include the property of the county or counties and any school district or other political subdivision within the authority. There shall also be given the name of the owner of record of each lot or parcel where practicable, and a statement of the method of assessment used by the director. 
(b)  The total cost of the improvement and the amount of incidental expense. 
In making such preliminary assessments the director may use any method of determining the amount of special benefits accruing to each lot or parcel of land or property from such assessable improvements as shall be approved by the board. Such special benefits may be based on an area assessment where benefits from such assessable improvements are equal or nearly equal for lands or property in a particular area, front footage, square footage of structures, cubic measurement of structures, potential uses, or any other factors which the board deems fair and equitable as between the different lots or parcels of land or property benefited. It shall be the duty of the director in making such preliminary assessment roll to view all lots or parcels of land or property to be assessed, and to determine, for the preliminary assessment roll, the amount of benefit which each lot or parcel of land or property will receive from such assessable improvements, under the method or methods prescribed by the board, or any combination thereof. 
(8)  The preliminary roll shall be advisory only and shall be subject to the action of the board as hereinafter provided. Upon the filing with the board of the preliminary assessment roll, the board shall publish at least once in a newspaper or newspapers published or of general circulation within the downtown [area], a notice stating that at a meeting of the board to be held on a certain day and hour, not less than fifteen (15) days from the date of such publication, which meeting may be a regular, adjourned or special meeting, all interested persons may appear and file written objections to the confirmation of such roll. Such notice shall state the class of the assessable improvements and the location thereof by terminal points, route or otherwise. The board shall also mail a copy of such notice to the persons, firms or corporations referred to in subsection (3) at least ten (10) days before the time for the meeting as stated in such notice, but the failure of the board to mail any such notice shall not constitute a valid objection to holding such meeting or to any other action taken under the authority of this section. 
(9)  At the time and place stated in such notice the board shall meet and receive the objections in writing of all interested persons as stated in such notice. The board may adjourn the hearing from time to time. After the completion thereof the board shall either annul or sustain or modify in whole or in part the preliminary assessment as indicated on such roll, either by confirming the preliminary assessment against any or all lots or parcels described therein or by cancelling, increasing or reducing the same, according to the special benefits which the board decides each such lot or parcel has received or will receive on account of such improvement. If any property which may be chargeable under this section shall have been omitted from the preliminary roll, or if the preliminary assessment shall not have been made against it, the board may place on such roll an apportionment to such property. The board shall not confirm any assessment in excess of the special benefits to the property assessed, and the assessments so confirmed shall be in proportion to the special benefits. The assessment so made shall be final and conclusive as to each lot or parcel assessed unless proper steps be taken within thirty (30) days in the circuit court for the Twelfth Circuit to secure relief. If the assessment against any property shall be sustained or reduced or abated by the court, the board shall note that fact on the assessment roll opposite the description of the property affected thereby. The amount of the special assessment against any lot or parcel which may be reduced or abated by the court, unless the assessment upon the entire authority be reduced or abated, or the amount by which such assessment is so reduced or abated, may by resolution of the board be made chargeable against the authority at large; or, at the discretion of the board a new assessment roll may be prepared and confirmed in the manner hereinabove provided for the preparation and confirmation of the original assessment roll. 
(10)  Any assessment may be paid at the office of the board within sixty (60) days after the confirmation thereof, without interest. Thereafter all assessments shall be payable at such times, over such period of years not exceeding twenty (20) years, and such annual or other installments with interest at such rate not exceeding eight per cent (8%) per annum on the unpaid principal amount of such assessments from the expiration of said sixty (60) days, as the board shall determine by resolution. The board may provide that any assessment may be paid at any time before due, together with interest accrued thereon to the date of prepayment, if such prior payment shall be permitted by the proceedings authorizing any assessment bonds or other obligations for the payment of which such special assessments have been pledged. 
(11)  All such special assessments shall be collected by the tax collector of Manatee County, or by such other officer or agent as the board may designate, at such within sixty (60) days after the confirmation thereof, time or times as the board shall specify in the proceedings authorizing or confirming the special assessments, and if no other time is specified then at the same time as general city taxes are collected in the city. 
(12)  All assessments shall constitute a lien upon the property so assessed from the date of confirmation of the resolution ordering the improvement, of the same nature and to the same extent as the lien for general city taxes falling due in the same year or years in which such assessments or installments thereof fall due, and any assessment or installment not paid when due shall be collectible with such interest and with a reasonable attorney's fee and costs, but without penalties, by the authority by proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction as prescribed by general law to foreclose the lien of assessments as a lien for mortgages is or may be foreclosed under the laws of the state; provided that any such proceedings to foreclose shall embrace all installments of principal remaining unpaid with accrued interest thereon, which installments shall, by virtue of the institution of such proceedings, immediately become due and payable. Nevertheless, if prior to any sale of the property under decree of foreclosure in such proceedings, payment be made of the installment or installments which are shown to be due under the provisions of the resolution passed pursuant to subsection (9) and subsection (10), and all costs including interest and attorney's fees, such payments shall have the effect of restoring the remaining installments to their original maturities, and the proceedings shall be dismissed. It shall be the duty of the authority to enforce the prompt collection of assessments by the means herein provided, and such duty may be enforced at the suit of any holder of bonds issued under this act in a court of competent jurisdiction, as prescribed by general law, by mandamus or other appropriate proceedings or action. 
Not later than thirty (30) days after any installments are due and payable, it shall be the duty of the board to direct the attorney or attorneys whom the board shall then designate to institute action within two (2) months after such direction to enforce the collection of all special assessments for assessable improvements made under this section and remaining due and unpaid at the time of such direction. Such action shall be prosecuted in a manner and under the conditions in and under which mortgages are foreclosed under the laws of the state. It shall be lawful to join in one action the collection of assessments against any or all property assessed by virtue of the same assessment roll unless the court shall deem such joinder prejudicial to the interests of any defendant. The court shall allow a reasonable attorney's fee for the attorney or attorneys of the authority, and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to the costs of the action. At the sale pursuant to decree in any such action, the authority may be a purchaser to the same extent as an individual person or corporation, except that the part of the purchase price represented by the assessments sued upon and the interest thereon need not be paid in cash. Property so acquired by the authority may be sold or otherwise disposed of, the proceeds of such disposition to be placed in the fund provided by subsection (13) of this section, provided, however, that no sale or other disposition thereof shall be made unless the notice calling for bids therefor to be received at a stated time and place shall have been published at least once in a newspaper or newspapers published or of general circulation in the downtown [area]. 
(13)  All assessments and charges made under the provisions of this section for the payment of all or any part of the cost of any assessable improvements for which assessment bonds shall have been issued under the provisions of this law, or which have been pledged as additional security for any other bonds or obligations issued under this act, shall be maintained in a special fund or funds and be used only for the payment of principal of or interest on such assessment bonds or other bonds or obligations. 
(14)  Subject to the terms of any bonds or other obligation payable from or secured by the assessments provided for herein, the board may at any time and from time to time modify, in whole or in part, or revoke any plan or specification for any assessable improvement. In connection with the revision of any such plan or specification, benefits may be reassessed or additional assessments made in accordance with the provisions and procedures of this Section 15. The board may at any time approve and make effective technical changes and modifications of any plan for any improvement not affecting the determination of assessed benefits or the security of bond owners. 
Sec. 16. - Encouragement of private enterprise. 
    The authority, to the greatest extent it determines to be feasible in carrying out the provisions of this act, shall afford maximum opportunity, consistent with the sound needs of said authority as a whole, to the rehabilitation or redevelopment of the renewal area by private enterprise. The authority shall give consideration to this objective in exercising its powers under this act, including the approval of renewal plans (consistent with the general plan of the city), the enforcement of restrictions, regulations and agreements relating to the use of land and the use and occupancy of buildings and improvements, the disposition of any property acquired, and the provision of necessary public improvements. 
Sec. 17. - Workable program. 
    The authority for the purposes of this act may cooperate with the city, or with Manatee County, in the formulation of a workable program for community improvements, utilizing appropriate private and public resources to eliminate, and prevent the development or spread of slums and urban blight, to encourage needed urban rehabilitation, to provide for the redevelopment of slum and blighted areas, or to undertake such of the aforesaid activities or other feasible municipal activities as may be suitably employed to achieve the objectives of such workable program. Such workable program may include, without limitation, provision for: The prevention of the spread of blight into areas of the authority which are free from blight through diligent enforcement of housing, zoning and occupancy controls and standards; the rehabilitation or conservation of slum and blighted areas or portions thereof by replanning, removing congestion, providing parks, playgrounds and other public improvements, by encouraging voluntary rehabilitation and by compelling the repair and rehabilitation of deteriorated or deteriorating structures; and the clearance and redevelopment of slum and blighted areas or portions thereof. 
Sec. 18. - Renewal projects; preparation and approval of renewal plans. 
(1)  The authority shall not approve a renewal project for a renewal area unless the board has, by resolution, determined such area to be a slum area or a blighted area or a combination thereof and designated such area as appropriate for a renewal project. Said board shall not approve a renewal plan until a general plan for the downtown has been prepared. For this purpose and other authority purposes, authority is hereby vested in said authority to prepare, to adopt and to revise from time to time, a general plan for the physical development of the downtown as a whole (giving due regard to the environs and metropolitan surroundings). 
(2)  The authority may prepare or cause to be prepared a renewal plan, or any person or agency, public or private, may submit such a plan to said authority. Prior to its approval of a renewal project the board shall submit such plan to the planning commission of the city for review and recommendations as to its conformity with the general plan for the development of the city as a whole. The planning commission shall submit its written recommendations with respect to the proposed renewal plan to the authority within thirty (30) days after receipt of the plan for review. Upon receipt of the recommendations of the planning commission, or, if no recommendations are received within said thirty (30) days, then without such recommendations, said authority may proceed with the hearing on the proposed renewal project prescribed herein. No person other than the city shall be entitled to raise the question of inconsistency of any plan with the general plan of the city. 
(3)  The authority shall hold a public hearing on a renewal project, after public notice thereof by publication in a newspaper having a general circulation in the area of operation of the authority. The notice shall describe the time, date, place and purpose of the hearing, shall generally identify the renewal area covered by the plan, and shall outline the general scope of the renewal project under consideration. 
(4)  Following such hearing, the Authority may approve a renewal project if it finds that: 
(a)  A feasible method exists for the relocation of families who will be displaced from the renewal area in decent, safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations within their means and without undue hardship to such families; 
(b)  A feasible method exists for the temporary relocation of businesses into equivalent or better quarters without undue hardship on such businesses; 
(c)  The renewal plan conforms to the general plan of the municipality as a whole; and 
(d)  The renewal plan will afford maximum opportunity, consistent with the sound needs of the municipality as a whole, for the rehabilitation or redevelopment of the renewal area by private enterprise. 
(5)  A renewal plan may be modified at any time. Provided that if modified after the lease or sale by the authority of real property in the renewal project area, such modification may be conditioned upon such approval of the owner, lessee or successor in interest as the authority may deem advisable and in any event shall be subject to such rights at law or in equity as a lessee or purchaser, or his successor or successors in interest, may be entitled to assert. 
(6)  Upon the approval by the authority of a renewal plan or of any modification thereof, such plan or modification shall be deemed to be in full force and effect for the respective renewal area and the authority may then cause such plan or modification to be carried out in accordance with its terms. 
(7)  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this act, where the authority certifies that an area is in need of redevelopment or rehabilitation as a result of a flood, fire, hurricane, earthquake, storm, or other catastrophe respecting which the governor of the state has certified the need for disaster assistance under the Public Law 875, Eighty-first Congress, or other federal law, the board may approve a renewal plan and a renewal project with respect to such area without regard to the provisions of subsection (4) of this section and the provisions of this section requiring a general plan for the city and a public hearing on the renewal project. 
Sec. 19. - Renewal projects; powers of the authority. 
    The authority shall have all the powers necessary or convenient to carry out and effectuate the purposes and provisions of this act, including the following powers in addition to others herein granted:

Provided, however, that no statutory provisions with respect to the acquisition, clearance or disposition of property by public bodies shall restrict the authority in the exercise of such functions with respect to a renewal project, unless the legislature shall specifically so state; 
(4)  To invest any renewal project funds held in reserves or sinking funds or any such funds not required for immediate disbursement, in property or securities in which banks may legally invest funds subject to their control; to redeem such bonds as have been issued pursuant to this act at the redemption price established therein or to purchase such bonds at less than redemption price, all such bonds so redeemed or purchased to be cancelled;

Provided, that such sale, lease, other transfer, or retention, and any agreement relating thereto, may be made only after the approval of the renewal plan by the board. The purchasers or lessees and their successors and assigns shall be obligated to devote such real property only to the uses specified in the renewal plan, and may be obligated to comply with such other requirements as the authority may determine to be in the public interest, including the obligation to begin within a reasonable time any improvements on such real property required by the renewal plan. Such real property or interest shall be sold, leased, otherwise transferred, or retained at not less than its fair value for uses in accordance with the renewal plan. In determining the fair value of real property for uses in accordance with the renewal plan, the authority shall take into account and give consideration to the uses provided in such plan; the restrictions upon, and the covenants, conditions and obligations assumed by the purchaser or lessee or by the authority retaining the property; and the objectives of such plan for the prevention of the recurrence of a slum or blighted areas.

The authority may, by public notice by publication in a newspaper having a general circulation in the community (thirty (30) days prior to the execution of any contract to sell, lease or otherwise transfer real property and prior to the delivery of any instrument of conveyance with respect thereto under provisions of this section) invite proposals from and make available all pertinent information to private redevelopers or any persons interested in undertaking to redevelop or rehabilitate a renewal area, or any part thereof. Such notice shall identify the area, or portion thereof, and shall state that proposals shall be made by those interested within thirty (30) days after the date of publication of said notice, and that such further information as is available may be obtained at such office as shall be designated in said notice. The authority shall consider all such redevelopment or rehabilitation proposals and the financial and legal ability of the persons making such proposals to carry them out, and may negotiate with any persons for proposals for the purchase, lease or other transfer of any real property acquired by the authority in the renewal area. The authority may accept such proposal as it deems to be in the public interest and in furtherance of the purposes of this act. Provided, that a notification of intention to accept such proposal shall be filed with the board not less than thirty (30) days prior to any such acceptance. Thereafter, the authority may execute such contract in accordance with the provisions of subsection (1) and deliver deeds, leases, and other instruments and take all steps necessary to effectuate such contract.

Such bonds may be made payable, as to both principal and interest, from the income, proceeds, revenues, and funds of the authority derived from or held in connection with its undertaking and carrying out of renewal projects under this act. Provided, however, that payment of such bonds, both as to principal and interest, may be further secured by a pledge of any loan, grant or contribution from the federal government or other source, in aid of any renewal projects of the authority under this act. 
(2)  Bonds issued under this section shall not constitute an indebtedness within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory debt limitation or restriction, and shall not be subject to the provisions of any other law or charter relating to the authorization, issuance or sale of bonds. Bonds issued under the provisions of this act are declared to be issued for an essential public and governmental purpose and, together with interest thereon and income therefrom, shall be exempted from all taxes; provided however, that any interest, income or profits on debt obligations issued hereunder shall not be exempt from the tax imposed by F.S. ch. 220; and any property to which provisions of this act apply, which is leased to a nongovernmental lessee, shall be exempt from ad valorem taxation only when and to the extent that the lessee serves or performs a governmental, municipal, or public purpose or function as defined in F.S. § 196.012(5). 
(3)  Bonds issued under this section shall be authorized by resolution or ordinance of the board and may be issued in one or more series and shall bear such date or dates, be payable upon demand or mature at such time or times, bear such interest, be in such denomination or denominations, be in such form either coupon or registered, carry such conversion or registration privileges, have such rank or priority, be executed in such manner, be payable in such medium of payment, at such place or places, and be subject to such terms of redemption (with or without premium), be secured in such manner, and have such other characteristics, as may be provided by such resolution or trust indenture or mortgage issued pursuant thereto. 
(4)  Such bonds may be sold at not less than par at public sales held after notice published prior to such sale in a newspaper having a general circulation in the area of operation and in such other medium of publications as the authority may determine or may be exchanged for other bonds on a basis of par. Provided, that such bonds may be sold to the federal government at private sale at not less than par, and, in the event less than all of the authorized principal amount of such bonds is sold to the federal government the balance may be sold at private sale at not less than par at an interest cost to the authority not to exceed the interest cost to the authority of the portion of the bonds sold to the federal government. 
(5)  In case any of the public officials of the authority whose signatures appear on any bonds or coupons issued under this act shall cease to be such officials before the delivery of such bonds, such signatures shall, nevertheless, be valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if such officials had remained in office until such delivery. Any provision of any law to the contrary notwithstanding, any bonds issued pursuant to this act shall be fully negotiable. 
(6)  In any suit, action or proceeding involving the validity or enforceability of any bond issued under this act or the security therefor, any such bond reciting in substance that it has been issued by the authority in connection with a renewal project, as herein defined, shall be conclusively deemed to have been issued for such purpose and such project shall be conclusively deemed to have been planned, located and carried out in accordance with the provisions of this act. 
Sec. 22. - Renewal projects; cooperation by public bodies. 
(1)  For the purpose of aiding in the planning, undertaking or carrying out of a renewal project located within the area in which it is authorized to act, any public body may, upon such terms, with or without consideration, as it may determine:

If at any time title to or possession of any renewal project is held by any public body or governmental agency, other than the authority, which is authorized by law to engage in the undertaking, carrying out, or administration of renewal projects (including any agency or instrumentality of the United States of America), the provisions of the agreements referred to in this section shall inure to the benefit of any [and] may be enforced by such body or governmental agency. 
(2)  Any sale, conveyance, lease or agreement provided for in this section may be made by a public body without appraisal, public notice, advertisement or public bidding.

    Act means the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (PL. 93-406) and any regulations issued thereunder by the Department of Labor and the Internal Revenue Service, as that Statute and these regulations shall be amended.

A Member may voluntarily leave his Accumulated Contributions in the Fund for a period of five (5) years after leaving the employ of the Fire Department pending the possibility of being reemployed as a Firefighter, without losing credit for the time that he was a Member of the System. If a vested Member leaves the employ of the Fire Department, his Accumulated Contributions will be returned only upon his written request. If a Member who is not vested is not reemployed as a Firefighter with the Fire Department within five (5) years, his Accumulated Contributions, if one-thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or less, shall be returned.

Upon return of a Member's Accumulated Contributions, all of his rights and benefits under the System are forfeited and terminated. Upon any reemployment, a Firefighter shall not receive credit for years or completed months of service for which he has withdrawn his Accumulated Contributions from the Fund, unless the Firefighter repays into the Fund the contributions he has withdrawn, with interest, as determined by the Board, within ninety (90) days after his reemployment.

(d)  This paragraph is intended to satisfy the minimum requirements of USERRA. To the extent that this paragraph does not meet the minimum standards of USERRA, as it may be amended from time to time, the minimum standards shall apply. 
    In the event a Member dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing USERRA Qualified Military Service, the beneficiaries of the Member are entitled to any benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) as if the Member had resumed employment and then died while employed. 
    Beginning January 1, 2009, to the extent required by Section 414(u)(12) of the Code, an individual receiving differential wage payments (as defined under Section 3401(h)(2) of the Code) from an employer shall be treated as employed by that employer, and the differential wage payment shall be treated as compensation for purposes of applying the limits on annual additions under Section 415(c) of the Code. This provision shall be applied to all similarly situated individuals in a reasonably equivalent manner.

    Fund means the trust fund established herein as part of the System. 
    Member means an actively employed Firefighter who fulfills the prescribed membership requirements. Benefit improvements which, in the past, have been provided for by amendments to the System adopted by City ordinance, and any benefit improvements which might be made in the future shall apply prospectively and shall not apply to Members who terminate employment or who retire prior to the effective date of any ordinance adopting such benefit improvements, unless such ordinance specifically provides to the contrary. 
    Plan Year means the twelve (12) month period beginning October 1 and ending September 30 of the following year.

    For service earned after April 15, 2012, Salary shall not include more than three hundred (300) hours per calendar year for overtime paid for call back purposes. Hours required to be worked as part of the Member's normal work schedule shall not be deemed overtime and shall not count toward the three hundred (300) hour cap. Provided however, in any event, payment for overtime in excess of three hundred (300) hours accrued in calendar year 2012 as of April 15, 2012, and attributable to service earned prior to April 15, 2012 shall be included in Salary. 
    For service earned after April 15, 2012, Salary shall also not include payments for accrued unused vacation leave and sick leave. Provided however, in any event, payments received for accrued unused vacation leave and sick leave shall be included in Salary in an amount not to exceed the combined dollar value of the hours of unused vacation leave accrued as of April 15, 2012, plus one half (1/2) of the hours of unused sick leave accrued as of April 15, 2012, based on the Member's hourly rate of pay as of April 15, 2012. 
    Compensation in excess of limitations set forth in Section 401(a)(17) of the Code as of the first day of the Plan Year shall be disregarded for any purpose, including employee contributions or any benefit calculations. The annual compensation of each member taken into account in determining benefits or employee contributions for any Plan Year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, may not exceed $200,000, as adjusted for cost-of-living increases in accordance with Code Section 401(a)(17)(B). Compensation means compensation during the fiscal year. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination period that begins with or within such calendar year. If the determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the annual compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period, and the denominator of which is 12, If the compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a Member's contributions or benefits for the current Plan Year, the compensation for such prior determination period is subject to the applicable annual compensation limit in effect for that prior period.. The limitation on compensation for an "eligible employee" shall not be less than the amount which was allowed to be taken into account hereunder as in effect on July 1, 1993. "Eligible employee" is an individual who was a Member before the first Plan Year beginning after December 31, 1995.

Section 4. - Finances and fund management. 
    Establishment and Operation of Fund. 
(1)  As part of the System, there exists the Fund, into which shall be deposited all of the contributions and assets whatsoever attributable to the System. 
(2)  The actual custody and supervision of the Fund (and assets thereof) shall be vested in the Board. Payment of benefits and disbursements from the Fund shall be made by the disbursing agent but only upon written authorization from the Board. 
(3)  All funds of the Firefighters' Retirement System may be deposited by the Board with the Treasurer of the City, acting in a ministerial capacity only, who shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as he is liable for the safekeeping of funds for the City. However, any funds so deposited with the Treasurer of the City shall be kept in a separate fund by the Treasurer or clearly identified as such funds of the Firefighters' Retirement System. In lieu thereof, the Board shall deposit the funds of the Firefighters' Retirement System in a qualified public depository as defined in § 280.02, Florida Statutes, which depository with regard to such funds shall conform to and be bound by all of the provisions of Chapter 280, Florida Statutes. In order to fulfill its investment responsibilities as set forth herein, the Board may retain the services of a custodian bank, an investment advisor registered under Investment Advisors Act of 1940 or otherwise exempt from such required registration, an insurance company, or a combination of these, for the purposes of investment decisions and management. Such investment manager shall have discretion, subject to any guidelines as prescribed by the Board, in the investment of all Fund assets. 
(4)  All funds and securities of the System may be commingled in the Fund, provided that accurate records are maintained at all times reflecting the financial composition of the Fund, including accurate current accounts and entries as regards the following: 
(a)  Current amounts of Accumulated Contributions of Members on both an individual and aggregate account basis, and 
(b)  Receipts and disbursements, and 
(c)  Benefit payments, and 
(d)  Current amounts clearly reflecting all monies, funds and assets whatsoever attributable to contributions and deposits from the City, and 
(e)  All interest, dividends and gains (or losses) whatsoever, and 
(f)  Such other entries as may be properly required so as to reflect a clear and complete financial report of the Fund. 
(5)  An audit shall be performed annually by a certified public accountant for the most recent fiscal year of the System showing a detailed listing of assets and a statement of all income and disbursements during the year. Such income and disbursements must be reconciled with the assets at the beginning and end of the year. Such report shall reflect a complete evaluation of assets on both a cost and market basis, as well as other items normally included in a certified audit. 
(6)  The Board shall have the following investment powers and authority: 
(a)  The Board shall be vested with full legal title to said Fund, subject, however, and in any event to the authority and power of the Bradenton City Council to amend or terminate this Fund, provided that no amendment or Fund termination shall ever result in the use of any assets of this Fund except for the payment of regular expenses and benefits under this System, except as otherwise provided herein. All contributions from time to time paid into the Fund, and the income thereof, without distinction between principal and income, shall be held and administered by the Board or its agent in the Fund and the Board shall not be required to segregate or invest separately any portion of the Fund. 
(b)  All monies paid into or held in the Fund shall be invested and reinvested by the Board and the investment of all or any part of such funds shall be subject to the following: 
1.  Notwithstanding any limitation provided for in F.S. ch. 175 to the contrary (unless such limitation may not be amended by local ordinance) or any limitation in prior city ordinances to the contrary, all monies paid into or held in the Fund may be invested and reinvested in such securities, investment vehicles or property wherever situated and of whatever kind, as shall be approved by the Board, including but not limited to common or preferred stocks, bonds, and other evidences of indebtedness or ownership. In no event, however, shall more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the assets of the Fund at market value be invested in foreign securities. 
2.  The Board shall develop and adopt a written investment policy statement setting forth permissible types of investments, goals and objectives of investments and setting quality and quantity limitations on investments in accordance with the recommendations of its investment consultants. The investment policy statement shall be reviewed by the Board at least annually. 
3.  In addition, the Board may, upon recommendation by the Board's investment consultant, make investments in group trusts meeting the requirements of Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 81-100, Revenue Ruling 2011-1, IRS Notice 2012-6 and Revenue Ruling 2014-24 or successor rulings or guidance of similar import, and operated or maintained exclusively for the commingling and collective investment of monies, provided that the funds in the group trust consist exclusively of trust assets held under plans qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, individual retirement accounts that are exempt under Section 408(e) of the Code, eligible governmental plans that meet the requirements of Section 457(b) of the Code, and governmental plans under [Section] 401(a)(24) of the Code. For this purpose, a trust includes a custodial account or a separate tax favored account maintained by an insurance company that is treated as a trust under Section 401(f) or under Section 457(g)(3) of the Code. While any portion of the assets of the Fund are invested in such a group trust, such group trust is itself adopted as a part of the System or plan. 
a.  Any collective or common group trust to which assets of the fund are transferred pursuant to subsection 3. shall be adopted by the board as part of the plan by executing appropriate participation, adoption agreements, and/or trust agreements with the group trust's trustee. 
b.  The separate account maintained by the group trust for the plan pursuant to subsection 3. shall not be used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than for the exclusive benefit of the members and beneficiaries of the plan. 
c.  For purposes of valuation, the value of the separate account maintained by the group trust for the plan shall be the fair market value of the portion of the group trust held for the plan, determined in accordance with generally recognized valuation procedures. 
(c)  At least once every three (3) years, and more often as determined by the Board, the Board shall retain a professionally qualified independent consultant, as defined in Section 175.071, Florida Statutes, to evaluate the performance of all current investment managers and make recommendations regarding the retention of all such investment managers. These recommendations shall be considered by the Board at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
(d)  The Board may retain in cash and keep unproductive of income such amount of the Fund as it may deem advisable, having regard for the cash requirements of the System. 
(e)  Neither the Board nor any Trustee shall be liable for the making, retention or sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of the Fund, except that due to his or its own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. 
(f)  The Board may cause any investment in securities held by it to be registered in or transferred into its name as Trustee or into the name of such nominee as it may direct, or it may retain them unregistered and in form permitting transferability, but the books and records shall at all times show that all investments are part of the Fund. 
(g)  The Board is empowered, but is not required, to vote upon any stocks, bonds, or securities of any corporation, association, or trust and to give general or specific proxies or powers of attorney with or without power of substitution; to participate in mergers, reorganizations, recapitalizations, consolidations, and similar transactions with respect to such securities; to deposit such stock or other securities in any voting trust or any protective or like committee with the Trustees or with depositories designated thereby; to amortize or fail to amortize any part or all of the premium or discount resulting from the acquisition or disposition of assets; and generally to exercise any of the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, or other investments comprising the Fund which it may deem to be to the best interest of the Fund to exercise. 
(h)  The Board shall not be required to make any inventory or appraisal or report to any court, nor to secure any order of court for the exercise of any power contained herein. 
(i)  Where any action which the Board is required to take or any duty or function which it is required to perform either under the terms herein or under the general law applicable to it as Trustee under this ordinance, can reasonably be taken or performed only after receipt by it from a Member, the City, or any other entity, of specific information, certification, direction or instructions, the Board shall be free of liability in failing to take such action or perform such duty or function until such information, certification, direction or instruction has been received by it. 
(j)  Any overpayments or underpayments from the Fund to a Member, Retiree or Beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate per annum approved by the Board in such a manner that the Actuarial Equivalent of the benefit to which the Member or Beneficiary was correctly entitled, shall be paid. Overpayments shall be charged against payments next succeeding the correction or collected in another manner if prudent. Underpayments shall be made up from the Fund in a prudent manner. 
(k)  The Board shall sustain no liability whatsoever for the sufficiency of the Fund to meet the payments and benefits provided for herein. 
(l)  In any application to or proceeding or action in the courts, only the Board shall be a necessary party, and no Member or other person having an interest in the Fund shall be entitled to any notice or service of process. Any judgment entered in such a proceeding or action shall be conclusive upon all persons. 
(m)  Any of the foregoing powers and functions reposed in the Board may be performed or carried out by the Board through duly authorized agents, provided that the Board at all times maintains continuous supervision over the acts of any such agent; provided further, that legal title to said Fund shall always remain in the Board.

For all other purposes of the System, such contributions shall be considered to be Member contributions. 
(b)  Method. Such contributions shall be made by payroll deduction. 
(2)  State Contributions.

(4)  Other. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the Fund, but such deposits must be accounted for separately and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis.

Nothing herein shall be construed to extend or otherwise affect the provisions of Chapter 440, Florida Statutes, pertaining to Worker's Compensation. 
(b)  Additional Presumption. The presumption provided for in this subparagraph (b) shall apply only to those conditions described in this subparagraph (b) that are diagnosed on or after January 1, 1996. 
1.  Definitions. As used in this subsection (2)(b), the following definitions apply: 
a.  "Body fluids" means blood and body fluids containing visible blood and other body fluids to which universal precautions for prevention of occupational transmission of blood-borne pathogens, as established by the Centers for Disease Control, apply. For purposes of potential transmission of meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis, the term "body fluids" includes respiratory, salivary, and sinus fluids, including droplets, sputum, and saliva, mucous, and other fluids through which infectious airborne organisms can be transmitted between persons. 
b.  "Emergency rescue or public safety Member" means any Member employed full time by the City as a firefighter, paramedic, emergency medical technician, law enforcement officer, or correctional officer who, in the course of employment, runs a high risk of occupational exposure to hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis and who is not employed elsewhere in a similar capacity. However, the term "emergency rescue or public safety Member" does not include any person employed by a public hospital licensed under Chapter 395, Florida Statutes, or any person employed by a subsidiary thereof. 
c.  "Hepatitis" means hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis non-A, hepatitis non-B, hepatitis C, or any other strain of hepatitis generally recognized by the medical community. 
d.  "High risk of occupational exposure" means that risk that is incurred because a person subject to the provisions of this subsection, in performing the basic duties associated with his employment: 
(i)  Provides emergency medical treatment in a non-health-care setting where there is a potential for transfer of body fluids between persons; 
(ii)  At the site of an accident, fire, or other rescue or public safety operation, or in an emergency rescue or public safety vehicle, handles body fluids in or out of containers or works with or otherwise handles needles or other sharp instruments exposed to body fluids; 
(iii)  Engages in the pursuit, apprehension, and arrest of law violators or suspected law violators and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids; or 
(iv)  Is responsible for the custody, and physical restraint when necessary, of prisoners or inmates within a prison, jail, or other criminal detention facility, while on work detail outside the facility, or while being transported and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids. 
e.  "Occupational exposure," in the case of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, means an exposure that occurs during the performance of job duties that may place a worker at risk of infection. 
2.  Presumption. Any emergency rescue or public safety Member who suffers a condition or impairment of health that is caused by hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, that requires medical treatment, and that results in total or partial disability or death shall be presumed to have a disability suffered in the line of duty, unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence; however, in order to be entitled to the presumption, the Member must, by written affidavit as provided in Section 92.50, Florida Statutes, verify by written declaration that, to the best of his knowledge and belief: 
a.  In the case of a medical condition caused by or derived from hepatitis, he has not: 
(i)  Been exposed, through transfer of bodily fluids, to any person known to have sickness or medical conditions derived from hepatitis, outside the scope of his employment; 
(ii)  Had a transfusion of blood or blood components, other than a transfusion arising out of an accident or injury happening in connection with his present employment, or received any blood products for the treatment of a coagulation disorder since last undergoing medical tests for hepatitis, which tests failed to indicate the presence of hepatitis; 
(iii)  Engaged in unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior, as identified by the Centers for Disease Control or the Surgeon General of the United States or had sexual relations with a person known to him to have engaged in such unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior; or 
(iv)  Used intravenous drugs not prescribed by a physician. 
b.  In the case of meningococcal meningitis, in the 10 days immediately preceding diagnosis he was not exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known to have meningococcal meningitis or known to be an asymptomatic carrier of the disease. 
c.  In the case of tuberculosis, in the period of time since the Member's last negative tuberculosis skin test, he has not been exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known by him to have tuberculosis. 
3.  Immunization. Whenever any standard, medically recognized vaccine or other form of immunization or prophylaxis exists for the prevention of a communicable disease for which a presumption is granted under this section, if medically indicated in the given circumstances pursuant to immunization policies established by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Public Health Service, an emergency rescue or public safety Member may be required by the City to undergo the immunization or prophylaxis unless the Member's physician determines in writing that the immunization or other prophylaxis would pose a significant risk to the Member's health. Absent such written declaration, failure or refusal by an emergency rescue or public safety Member to undergo such immunization or prophylaxis disqualifies the Member from the benefits of the presumption. 
4.  Record of Exposures. The City shall maintain a record of any known or reasonably suspected exposure of an emergency rescue or public safety Member in its employ to the disease described in this Section and shall immediately notify the Member of such exposure. An emergency rescue or public safety Member shall file an incident or accident report with the City of each instance of known or suspected occupational exposure to hepatitis infection, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis. 
5.  Required medical tests; preemployment physical. In order to be entitled to the presumption provided by this section: 
a.  An emergency rescue or public safety Member must, prior to diagnosis, have undergone standard, medically acceptable tests for evidence of the communicable disease for which the presumption is sought, or evidence of medical conditions derived therefrom, which tests fail to indicate the presence of infection. This paragraph does not apply in the case of meningococcal meningitis. 
b.  On or after June 15, 1995, an emergency rescue or public safety Member may be required to undergo a preemployment physical examination that tests for and fails to reveal any evidence of hepatitis or tuberculosis. 
(3)  Disability benefits not-in-line of duty. Any Member with ten (10) years or more credited service who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to perform the duties the firefighter was assigned at the time of the impairment and unable to perform the duties of another position with the fire department which the City makes available to him in a similar job classification and rank at no reduction in salary for which the firefighter is qualified by reason of training, education or experience, wherein such disability is not directly caused by and attributable to the performance of his duties as a firefighter shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to two percent (2%) of his average final compensation multiplied by his total years of credited service, but in no event shall the total amount paid to the member be less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the average final compensation of the member. Eligibility requirements for disability benefits are set forth in subsection (9), below. 
(4)  Conditions Disqualifying Disability Benefits. Each Member who is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the Board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
(a)  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or narcotics. 
(b)  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections or while committing a crime. 
(c)  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the Armed Forces. 
(d)  Injury or disease sustained after his employment as a Firefighter with the City [of] Bradenton shall have terminated. 
(5)  Physical examination requirement. A member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons, who shall be selected by the board for that purpose. The board shall not select the member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose except in an unusual case where the board determines that it would be reasonable and prudent to do so. 
Any retiree receiving disability benefits under provisions of this ordinance may be required by the board to submit sworn statements of his condition accompanied by a physician's statement (provided at the retiree's expense) to the board annually and may be required by the board to undergo additional periodic re-examinations by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons who shall be selected by the board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the board finds that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, the board shall recommend to the City that the retiree be returned to performance of duty as a firefighter, and the retiree so returned shall enjoy the same rights that he had at the time he was placed upon pension. In the event the retiree so ordered to return shall refuse to comply with the order within thirty (30) days from the issuance thereof, he shall forfeit the right to his pension. 
The cost of the physical examination and/or re-examination of the member claiming or the retiree receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the Fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by the board incident to the physical examination, such as, but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the Fund. 
If the retiree recovers from disability and reenters the service of the City as a firefighter, his service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he reentered the service of the City will not be considered as credited service for the purposes of the system. 
The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability claims. 
(6)  Disability payments. The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled in the event of the member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be: 
(a)  If the retiree recovers from the disability, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery, or 
(b)  If the retiree dies without recovering from disability, the payment due next preceding his death or the 120th monthly payment, whichever is later. 
Provided, however, the disability retiree may select, at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in section 10, subsection (1)(a) or (1)(b), which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit. 
(7)  Workers' Compensation. When a Retiree is receiving a disability pension and workers' compensation benefits pursuant to Florida Statute Chapter 440, for the same disability, and the total monthly benefits received from both exceed 100% of the Member's average monthly wage, as defined in Chapter 440, Florida Statutes, the disability pension benefit shall be reduced so that the total monthly amount received by the Retiree does not exceed 100% of such average monthly wage. The amount of any lump sum workers' compensation payment shall be converted to an equivalent monthly benefit payable for ten (10) Years Certain by dividing the lump sum amount by 83.9692. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the disability pension benefit be reduced below the greater of forty-two percent (42%) of Average Final Compensation and two percent (2%) of Average Final Compensation times years of Credited Service. 
(8)  Remarriage of Spouse. The benefit of the surviving spouse of any disability retiree retiring prior to April 23, 2003, shall be paid for the remainder of his or her natural life as previously provided for, but the benefit shall not be discontinued upon the remarriage of the surviving spouse. 
(9)  Eligibility for Disability Benefits. Subject to (9)(d) below, only active members of the system on the date the board determines entitlement to a disability benefit are eligible for disability benefits. 
(a)  Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits. 
(b)  If a member voluntarily terminates his employment, either before or after filing an application for disability benefits, he is not eligible for disability benefits. 
(c)  If a member is terminated by the City for any reason other than for medical reasons, either before or after he files an application for disability benefits, he is not eligible for disability benefits. 
(d)  The only exceptions to (a) above are: 
1.  If the member is terminated by the City for medical reasons and he has already applied for disability benefits before the medical termination, or; 
2.  If the member is terminated by the City for medical reasons and he applies within 30 days after the medical termination date. 
    If either (d)1. or (d)2. above applies, the member's application will be processed and fully considered by the board. 
(Ord. No. 2843, § 1, 8-16-0; Ord. No. 2855, § 1, 2-28-07; Ord. No. 2910, § 6, 1-27-10; Ord. No. 2981, § 5, 4-27-16; Ord. No. 3038, § 1, 1-9-19) 
Section 9. - Vesting. 
    If a Member terminates his employment as a Firefighter, either voluntarily or by discharge, and is not eligible for any other benefits under this System, the Member shall be entitled to the following: 
(1)  If the Member has less than ten (10) years Credited Service upon termination, the Member shall be entitled to a refund of his Accumulated Contributions or the Member may leave it deposited with the Fund. 
(2)  If the Member has ten (10) or more years of Credited Service upon termination, the Member shall be entitled to a monthly retirement benefit, determined in the same manner as for normal or early retirement and based upon the Member's Credited Service, Average Final Compensation and the benefit accrual rate as of the date of termination, payable to him commencing at the Member's otherwise normal or early retirement date, determined as if he had remained employed, provided he does not elect to withdraw his Accumulated Contributions and provided the Member survives to his otherwise normal or early retirement date. If the Member does not withdraw his Accumulated Contributions and does not survive to his otherwise normal or early retirement date, his designated Beneficiary shall be entitled to a benefit as provided herein for a deceased Member, vested or eligible for Retirement under Pre-Retirement Death. 
(Ord. No. 2843, § 1, 8-16-06) 
Section 10. - Optional forms of benefits. 
(1)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early retirement as specified herein, a member, upon written request to the board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one of the following options: 
(a)  A retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the retiree for his lifetime only. 
(b)  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the retiree during the lifetime of the retiree and following the death of the retiree, one hundred percent (100%), seventy-five percent (75%), sixty-six and two thirds percent (66- 2/3 %); or fifty percent (50%) of such monthly amount payable to a joint pensioner for his lifetime. Except where the Retiree's joint pensioner is his spouse, the payments to the joint pensioner as a percentage of the payments to the Retiree shall not exceed the applicable percentage provided for in the applicable table in the Treasury regulations. (See Q & A-2 of 1,401(a)(9)-6) 
(c)  Pop-up option. In the event that a retiree has elected a joint and survivor annuity form of pension, that retiree may, in lieu of the option in (b) above, elect that if the retiree's joint annuitant predeceases the retiree, that the survivorship benefit shall be deemed canceled and the retiree's annuity shall revert to the amount of the original normal form of benefit determined before the joint and survivor option was elected. The dollar amount of cost of living adjustments since the date of retirement shall be added to the revised benefit amount. The adjusted amount will be effective on the first day of the month following the death of the retiree's joint annuitant. An eligible retiree, by electing this pop-up feature, consents to the actuarial adjustment of the retiree's retirement benefits sufficient to cover the cost of this feature. If a retiree chooses the pop up option, he may not change his joint annuitant, as provided for in (2) below, after his first benefit check is issued. 
(d)  If a member retires prior to the time at which social security benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as social security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the system, based upon the social security law in effect at the time of the member's retirement. 
(e)  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount calculated by combining a joint and survivor optional percentage pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c) above with the social security option pursuant to paragraph (d) above. 
(f)  For any member who does not participate in the DROP pursuant to Section 29, the member may elect a percentage of benefit in a lump sum as follows: 
1.  Ten (10) percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum, with the remaining ninety (90) percent paid under the normal form or as per (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) above. 
2.  Fifteen (15) percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum, with the remaining eighty-five (85) percent paid under the normal form or as per (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) above. 
3.  Twenty (20) percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum, with the remaining eighty (80) percent paid under the normal form or as per (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) above. 
4.  Twenty-five (25) percent of the total actuarial equivalent value of the benefit paid as a lump sum, with the remaining seventy-five (75) percent paid under the normal form or as per (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) above. 
(2)  The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner (subsection (1)(b), above) or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system in the event of member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. A member may change his beneficiary at any time. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner and the member's retirement income benefits have commenced, the member may thereafter change his designated beneficiary at any time, but may only change his joint pensioner twice. Subject to the restriction in the previous sentence, a member may substitute a new joint pensioner for a deceased joint pensioner. Effective April 1, 2006, any current retiree, regardless of his date of retirement, who elected to receive a joint and survivor option, may elect the options provided for in this subsection (2). However, retirees who received but did not elect to receive a joint and survivor benefit as provided for by previous plan provisions, may not elect the options provided in this subsection (2), unless any such options are otherwise applicable to them. In the absence of proof of good health of the joint pensioner being replaced, the actuary will assume that the joint pensioner has deceased for purposes of calculating the new payment. 
Effective April 1, 2006, any current retiree, regardless of his date of retirement, who elected to receive a joint and survivor option, may elect the options provided for in this subsection (2). However, retirees who received but did not elect to receive a joint and survivor benefit as provided for by previous plan provisions, may not elect the options provided in this subsection (2), unless any such options are otherwise applicable to them. 
(3)  The consent of a Member's or Retiree's joint pensioner or Beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously-designated Beneficiaries to receive benefits under the System shall thereupon cease. 
(4)  Upon change of a Retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this Section, the amount of the retirement income payable to the Retiree shall be actuarially redetermined to take into account the age of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the Retiree and to ensure that the benefit paid is the Actuarial Equivalent of the present value of the Retiree's then current benefit at the time of the change. Any such Retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the Board and on completion will be filed with the Board. In the event that no designated Beneficiary survives the Retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the Retiree subsequent to his Retirement shall be paid as provided in Section 11. 
(5)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this Section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(a)  If a Member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under Section 7. 
(b)  If the designated Beneficiary (or Beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the Member's Retirement under the System, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the Member upon his Retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this Section or a new Beneficiary is designated by the Member prior to his Retirement. 
(c)  If both the Retiree and the Beneficiary (or Beneficiaries) designated by Member or Retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (1), the Board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with Section 11. 
(d)  If a Member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of Section 6, subsection (1), and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this Section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a Beneficiary (or Beneficiaries) designated by the Member in the amount or amounts computed as if the Member had retired under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
(e)  The Member's benefit under this Section must begin to be distributed to the Member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the Member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the Member terminates employment with the City. 
(6)  A Retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
(7)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Board in its discretion may elect to make a lump sum payment to a Member or a Member's Beneficiary in the event that the total commuted value of the monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the Board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the System with regard to such Member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(Ord. No. 2843, § 1, 8-16-06; Ord. No. 2910, § 7, 1-27-10; Ord. No. 2968, § 2, 6-25-15) 
Section 11. - Beneficiaries. 
(1)  Each Member or Retiree may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the Board, designate a Beneficiary (or Beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the event of his death. Each designation may be revoked or changed by such Member or Retiree by signing and filing with the Board a new designation-of-beneficiary form. Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated Beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the System shall cease. 
(2)  If a deceased Member or Retiree failed to name a Beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection (1), or if the Beneficiary (or Beneficiaries) named by a deceased Member or Retiree predeceases the Member or Retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the System with respect to such deceased Member or Retiree shall be paid to the estate of the Member or Retiree and the Board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum. 
(3)  Any payment made to any person pursuant to this Section shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the System with regard to the deceased Member and any other persons with rights under the System and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder. 
Section 12. - Claims procedures. 
(1)  The Board shall establish administrative claims procedures to be utilized in processing written requests ("claims"), on matters which affect the substantial rights of any person ("Claimant"), including Members, Retirees, Beneficiaries, or any person affected by a decision of the Board. 
(2)  The Board shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents for discovery prior to and at any proceedings provided for in the Board's claims procedures. The Claimant may request in writing the issuance of subpoenas by the Board. A reasonable fee may be charged for the issuance of any subpoenas not to exceed the fees set forth in Florida Statutes. 
(Ord. No. 2843, § 1, 8-16-06) 
Section 13. - Reports to division of retirement. 
    Each year and no later than March 15th, the Board shall file an Annual Report with the Division of Retirement containing the documents and information regarding Section 175.261, Florida Statutes. 
(Ord. No. 2843, § 1, 8-16-06) 
Section 14. - Roster of retirees. 
    The Secretary of the Board shall keep a record of all persons enjoying a pension under the provisions of this ordinance in which it shall be noted the time when the pension is allowed and when the same shall cease to be paid. Additionally, the Secretary shall keep a record of all Members in such a manner as to show the name, address, date of employment and date of termination of employment. 
(Ord. No. 2843, § 1, 8-16-06) 
Section 15. - Maximum pension. 
(1)  Basic limitation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this system to the contrary, the member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the system shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of Code Section 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in Code Section 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) ($160,000.00), subject to the applicable adjustments in Code Section 415(b) and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this System. For purposes of this section, "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
    For purposes of Code Section 415(b), the "annual benefit" means a benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) without regard to the benefit attributable to after-tax employee contributions (except pursuant to Code Section 415(n) and to rollover contributions (as defined in Code Section 415(b)(2)(A)). The "benefit attributable" shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations. 
(2)  Adjustments to Basic Limitation for Form of Benefit. If the benefit under the plan is other than the annual benefit described in subsection (1), then the benefit shall be adjusted so that it is the equivalent of the annual benefit, using factors prescribed in Treasury Regulations. If the form of the benefit without regard to any automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity or a qualified joint and survivor annuity, then the preceding sentence is applied by either reducing the Code Section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date or adjusting the form of benefit to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the additional benefits under the form of benefit as follows: 
(a)  For a benefit paid in a form to which Section 417(e)(3) of the Code does not apply (generally, a monthly benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greater of: 
1.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the Member under the Plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit to the Member, or 
2.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the Member, computed using a five percent (5%) interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Rulings 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code); or 
(b)  For a benefit paid in a form to which Section 417(e)(3) of the Code applies (generally, a lump sum benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greatest of: 
1.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in the Plan for actuarial experience; 
2.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using a five and one half percent (5.5%) interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code); or 
3.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable (computed using the applicable interest rate for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) (the 30-year Treasury rate (prior to January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the month prior to retirement, and on and after January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the first day of the Plan Year with a one-year stabilization period)) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code), divided by 1.05. 
(c)  The actuary may adjust the 415(b) limit at the annuity starting date in accordance with subsections (a) and (b) above. 
(3)  Benefits Not Taken into Account. For purposes of this Section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
(a)  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
(b)  Any other benefit not required under §415(b)(2) of the Code and Regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of Code Section 415(b)(1); and 
(c)  That portion of any joint and survivor annuity that constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity. 
(4)  COLA Effect. Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b) (the "Limit"), the following will apply: 
(a)  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first limitation year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
(b)  Thereafter, in any subsequent limitation year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under Code Section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
(c)  In no event shall a member's benefit payable under the system in any limitation year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code Section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
Unless otherwise specified in the system, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b), a Member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost of living increases as required by Section 415(b) of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations. 
(5)  Other Adjustments in Limitations. 
(a)  In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age sixty-two (62), the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of Code Section 415(b) of the Code, so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a one hundred sixty thousand dollar ($160,000.00) annual benefit beginning at age sixty-two (62). 
(b)  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least fifteen (15) years of credited service as a full-time employee of the fire or police department of the City, the adjustments provided for in (5)(a) above shall not apply. 
(c)  The reductions provided for in (5)(a) above shall not be applicable to disability benefits pursuant to Sec. 8, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to Sec. 7. 
(d)  In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age sixty-five (65), for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (1) herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age sixty-five (65). This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. 
(6)  Less than Ten (10) Years of Participation. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any member who has completed less than ten (10) years of participation shall be the amount determined under subsection (1) of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of participation and the denominator of which is ten (10). The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below 10% of the limit determined without regard to this subsection. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to pre-retirement disability benefits paid pursuant to Sec. 8, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to Sec. 7. 
(7)  Participation in Other Defined Benefit Plans. The limit of this section with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in Code Section 414(j) maintained by the City shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all City defined benefit plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one plan. 
(8)  Ten Thousand Dollar ($10,000.00) Limit; Less Than Ten Years of Service. Notwithstanding anything in this Sec. 15, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this subsection (8) of Sec. 15 if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this system and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the City contributes, do not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) for the applicable limitation year or for any prior limitation year, and the City has not at any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated; provided, however, that if the Member has completed less than ten (10) years of Credited Service with the City, the limit under this subsection (8) Sec. 15 shall be a reduced limit equal to ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the Member's years of Credited Service and the denominator of which is ten (10). 
(9)  Reduction of Benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(10)  Service Credit Purchase Limits. 
(a)  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a member makes one or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the system, as allowed in Sections 24 and 27, then the requirements of this section will be treated as met only if: 
1.  The requirements of Code Section 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of Code Section 415(b), or 
2.  The requirements of Code Section 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of Code Section 415(c). 
For purposes of applying subparagraph (10)(a) 1., the System will not fail to meet the reduced limit under Code Section 415(b)(2)(C) solely by reason of this subparagraph and for purposes of applying subparagraph (10)(a)2. the System will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under Section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Code solely by reason of this subparagraph. 
(b)  For purposes of this subsection the term "permissive service credit" means service credit: 
1.  Recognized by the system for purposes of calculating a member's benefit under the plan, 
2.  Which such member has not received under the plan, and 
3.  Which such member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the system, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the system, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding clause (10)(b)2., may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a member is receiving under the system. 
(11)  Contribution Limits. 
(a)  For purposes of applying the Code Section 415(c) limits which are incorporated by reference and for purposes of this subsection (11), only and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable will be compensation actually paid or made available during a limitation year, except as noted below and as permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the system, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of Code Section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under Code Sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052 and will be determined without regard to any rules under Code Section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code Section 3401(a)(2). 
1.  However, for limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under Code Sections 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b). For limitation years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of Code Section 132(f)(4). 
2.  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the limitation year will also include compensation paid by the later of 21/2 months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
a.  The payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
b.  The payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
3.  Back pay, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this definition. 
(b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the board may modify a request by a member to make a contribution to the system if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in Code Section 415 by using the following methods: 
1.  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the board may establish a periodic payment deduction plan for the member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under Code Sections 415(c) or 415(n). 
2.  If payment pursuant to subparagraph (11)(b)1. will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by Code Section 415(c), the board may either reduce the member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the member's contribution. 
(c)  If the annual additions for any Member for a limitation year exceed the limitation under Section 415(c) of the Code, the excess annual addition will be corrected as permitted under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (or similar IRS correction program). 
(d)  For limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, a Member's compensation for purposes of this subsection (11) shall not exceed the annual limit under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code. 
(12)  Additional Limitation on Pension Benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
(a)  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of the system and who has not previously participated in such system, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
(b)  No member of the system shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to social security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 1223, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
(13)  Effect of Direct Rollover on 415(b) Limit. If the plan accepts a direct rollover of an employee's or former employee's benefit from a defined contribution plan qualified under Code Section 401(a) which is maintained by the employer, any annuity resulting from the rollover amount that is determined using a more favorable actuarial basis than required under Code Section 417(e) shall be included in the annual benefit for purposes of the limit under Code Section 415(b). 
(Ord. No. 2843, § 1, 8-16-06; Ord. No. 2910, § 8, 1-27-10; Ord. No. 2951, § 3, 7-17-13; Ord. No. 2981, § 6, 4-27-16) 
Section 16. - Minimum distribution of benefits. 
(1)  General Rules. 
(a)  Effective Date. Effective as of January 1, 1989, the Plan will pay all benefits in accordance with a good faith interpretation of the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations in effect under that section, as applicable to a governmental plan within the meaning of Code Section 414(d). Effective on and after January 1, 2003, the Plan is also subject to the specific provisions contained in this Section. The provisions of this Section will apply for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for calendar years beginning with the 2003 calendar year. 
(b)  Precedence. The requirements of this Section will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the Plan. 
(c)  TEFRA Section 242(b)(2) Elections. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section other than this subsection (1)(c), distributions may be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, in accordance with Section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) and the provisions of the plan that related to Section 242(b)(2) of TEFRA. 
(2)  Time and Manner of Distribution. 
(a)  Required Beginning Date. The Member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the Member no later than the Member's required beginning date which shall not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the Member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the Member terminates employment with the City. 
(b)  Death of Member Before Distributions Begin. If the Member dies before distributions begin, the Member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than as follows: 
1.  If the Member's surviving spouse is the Member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Member died, or by a date on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the Member would have attained age seventy and one-half (701/2), if later, as the surviving spouse elects. 
2.  If the Member's surviving spouse is not the Member's sole designated beneficiary, then, distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Member died. 
3.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the Member's death, the Member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Member's death. 
4.  If the Member's surviving spouse is the Member's sole designated Beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the Member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection (2)(b), other than subsection (2)(b)1., will apply as if the surviving spouse were the Member. 
For purposes of this subsection (2)(b), distributions are considered to begin on the Member's required beginning date or, if subsection (2)(b)4. applies, the date of distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (2)(b)1. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the Member before the Member's required beginning date (or to the Member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (2)(b)1.), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(c)  Death After Distributions Begin. If the Member dies after the required distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the Member's interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution before the Member's death. 
(d)  Form of Distribution. Unless the Member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with this Section. If the Member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury regulations. Any part of the Member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in Section 414(k) of the Code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(3)  Determination of Amount to be Distributed Each Year. 
(a)  General Requirements. If the Member's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the Plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
1.  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year. 
2.  The Member's entire interest must be distributed pursuant to Section 6, Section 7, Section 9, or Section 10 (as applicable) and in any event over a period equal to or less than the Member's life or the lives of the Member and a designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the Member or of the Member and a designated beneficiary. The life expectancy of the Member, the Member's spouse, or the Member's beneficiary may not be recalculated after the initial determination for purposes of determining benefits. 
(b)  Amount Required to be Distributed by Required Beginning Date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the Member's required beginning date (or, if the Member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under Section 7) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g. monthly. All of the Member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the Member's required beginning date. 
(c)  Additional Accruals After First Distribution Calendar Year. Any additional benefits accruing to the Member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
(4)  General distribution rules. 
(a)  The amount of an annuity paid to a Member's Beneficiary may not exceed the maximum determined under the incidental death benefit requirement of Code Section 401(a)(9)(G), and effective for any annuity commencing on or after January 1, 2008, the minimum distribution incidental benefit rule under Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(a)(9)-6, Q&A-2. 
(b)  The death and disability benefits provided by the plan are limited by the incidental benefit rule set forth in Code Section 401(a)(9)(G) and Treasury Regulation Section 1.401-1(b)(1)(I) or any successor regulation thereto. As a result, the total death or disability benefits payable may not exceed 25% of the cost for all of the Members' benefits received from the retirement system. 
(5)  Definitions. 
(a)  Designated Beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the Plan and is the designated beneficiary under Section 40I(a)(9) of the Code and Section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4, of the Treasury regulations. 
(b)  Distribution Calendar Year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the Member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the Member's required beginning date.

Any modification or amendment of the System may be made retroactively, if necessary or appropriate, to qualify or maintain the System as a Plan meeting the requirements of the applicable provisions of the Code as now in effect or hereafter amended, or any other applicable provisions of the U.S. federal tax laws, as now in effect or hereafter amended or adopted, and the regulations issued thereunder. 
(4)  Use of Forfeitures. Forfeitures arising from terminations of service of Members shall serve only to reduce future City contributions.

To the extent that the definition of "credited service" sets forth contribution requirements that are more favorable to the Member than the minimum compliance requirements, the more favorable provisions shall apply. 
(7)  Vesting. 
(a)  Member will be one hundred percent (100%) vested in all benefits upon attainment of the Plan's age and service requirements for the Plan's normal retirement benefit; and 
(b)  A member will be one hundred percent (100%) vested in all accrued benefits, to the extent funded, if the plan is terminated or experiences a complete discontinuance of employer contributions. 
(8)  Electronic Forms. In those circumstances where a written election or consent is not required by the plan or the Code, an oral, electronic, or telephonic form in lieu of or in addition to a written form may be prescribed by the board. However, where applicable, the board shall comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.401(a)-21. 
(9)  Compliance with Chapter 175, Florida Statutes. It is intended that the System will continue to qualify for funding under Section 175.101, Florida Statutes. Accordingly, unless otherwise required by law, any provision of the System which violates the requirements of Chapter 175, Florida Statutes, as amended from time to time, shall be superseded by and administered in accordance with the requirements of such chapter. 
(10)  Missing Benefit Recipients. The System shall follow the procedures outlined in the IRS Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (EPCRS) Program and other applicable IRS guidance to locate any missing individuals to whom a full unreduced benefit payment is due and if, at the conclusion of such efforts, the individual cannot be located, the existing procedure of cancelling payments otherwise due (provided that, if the individual is later located, the benefits due shall be paid) will apply. 
(Ord. No. 2843, § 1, 8-16-06; Ord. No. 2910, § 10, 1-27-10; Ord. No. 3038, § 2, 1-9-19) 
Section 18. - Repeal or termination of system. 
(1)  This ordinance establishing the System and Fund, and subsequent ordinances pertaining to said System and Fund, may be modified, terminated, or amended, in whole or in part; provided that if this or any subsequent ordinance shall be amended or repealed in its application to any person benefitting hereunder, the amount of benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment, or repeal shall have accrued to the Member or Beneficiary shall not be affected thereby. 
(2)  If this ordinance shall be repealed, or if contributions to the System are discontinued or if there is a transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions as provided in Chapter 121, Florida Statutes, the Board shall continue to administer the System in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance, for the sole benefit of the then Members, any Beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one of the options provided for in this ordinance who are designated by any of said Members. In the event of repeal, discontinuance of contributions, or transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions, there shall be full vesting (100%) of benefits accrued to date of repeal and such benefits shall be non-forfeitable. 
(3)  The Fund shall be distributed in accordance with the following procedures: 
(a)  The Board shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value required to fund all the nonforfeitable benefits after taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The Board shall inform the City if additional assets are required, in which event the City shall continue to financially support the plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded. 
(b)  The Board shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or otherwise, for each Firefighter entitled to benefits under the plan as specified in subsection (c). 
(c)  The Board shall distribute the asset value as of the date of termination in the manner set forth in this subsection, on the basis that the amount required to provide any given retirement income is the actuarially computed single-sum value of such retirement income, except that if the method of distribution determined under subsection (b) involves the purchase of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given retirement income is the single premium payable for such annuity. The actuarial single-sum value may not be less than the Firefighter's accumulated contributions to the plan, with interest if provided by the plan, less the value of any plan benefits previously paid to the Firefighter. 
(d)  If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection (c), and after the payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the City, less return to the State of the State's contributions, provided that, if the excess is less than the total contributions made by the City and the State to date of termination of the plan, such excess shall be divided proportionately to the total contributions made by the City and the State. 
(e)  The board shall distribute, in accordance with subsection (b), the amounts determined under subsection (c). 
If, after twenty-four (24) months after the date the plan terminated or the date the Board received written notice that the contributions thereunder were being permanently discontinued, the City or the Board of the fund affected has not complied with all the provisions in this section, the Florida Department of Management Services will effect the termination of the Fund in accordance with this section.

(b)  If a domestic relations order is not submitted to the board for review prior to entry of the order, and the system is ordered to take action that it may not legally take, and the system expends administrative or legal fees in resolving the matter, the member or retiree who submits such an order will be required to reimburse the system for its expenses in connection with the order. 
(2)  Retiree directed payments. The board may, upon written request by a retiree or by a dependent, when authorized by a retiree or the retiree's beneficiary, authorize the system to withhold from the monthly retirement payment those funds that are necessary to pay for the benefits being received through the city, to pay the certified bargaining agent of the city, to make payments to insurance companies for insurance premiums as permitted by Chapter 175, Florida Statutes, and to make any payments for child support or alimony. 
(3)  Exemption from execution, non-assignability. Except as otherwise provided by law, the pensions, annuities, or any other benefits accrued or accruing to any person under the provisions of this ordinance and the Accumulated Contributions and the cash securities in the Fund created under this ordinance are hereby exempted from any state, county or municipal tax of the state and shall not be subject to execution, attachment, garnishment or any legal process whatsoever and shall be unassignable.

Eligible rollover distribution: An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income. Effective January 1, 2002, any portion of any distribution which would be includible in gross income as after-tax employee contributions will be an eligible rollover distribution if the distribution is made to an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a); to an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b); to a qualified defined contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible; or on or after January 1, 2007, to a qualified defined benefit plan described in Code Section 401(a) or to an annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b), that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not so includible. 
2.  Eligible retirement plan: An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code; an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code; an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code; effective January 1, 2002, an eligible deferred compensation plan described in Section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by an eligible employer described in Section 457(e)(1)(A) of the Code and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan, an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code; effective January 1, 2002, or a qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the Code; or effective January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described in Section 408A of the Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. This definition shall also apply in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse. 
3.  Distributee: A distributee includes an employee or former employee. It also includes the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse. Effective January 1, 2007, it further includes a nonspouse beneficiary who is a designated beneficiary as defined by Code Section 401(a)(9)(E). However, a nonspouse beneficiary may rollover the distribution only to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving the distribution and the account or annuity will be treated as an "inherited" individual retirement account or annuity. 
4.  Direct rollover : A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(2)  Rollovers or transfers into the fund. On or after January 1, 2002, the system will accept, solely for the purpose of purchasing credited service as provided herein, permissible Member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans, member rollover cash contributions and/or direct cash rollovers of distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, as follows: 
(a)  Transfers and direct rollovers or member rollover contributions from other plans. The system will accept either a direct rollover of an eligible rollover distribution or a member contribution of an eligible rollover distribution from a qualified plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code, from an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Code or from an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state. The system will also accept legally permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans. 
(b)  Member rollover contributions from IRAs. The system will accept a member rollover contribution of the portion of a distribution from an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or 408(b) of the Code that is eligible to be rolled over. 
(3)  Elimination of Mandatory Distributions. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event this Plan provides for a mandatory (involuntary) cash distribution from the Plan not otherwise required by law, for an amount in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), such distribution shall be made from the Plan only upon written request of the Member and completion by the Member of a written election on forms designated by the Board, to either receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount.

Section 26. - Family and Medical Leave Act. 
    The fractional parts of the twelve (12) month period ending each March 1 that a Member is on leave without pay from the City pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) shall be added to his Credited Service provided that: 
(1)  The Member contributes to the Fund the sum that he would have contributed, based on his Salary and the Member contribution rate in effect at the time that the Credited Service is requested, had he been a Member of the System for the fractional parts of the twelve (12) months ending each March 1 for which he is requesting credit plus amounts actuarially determined such that the crediting of service does not result in any cost to the Fund plus payment of costs for all professional services rendered to the Board in connection with the purchase of periods of Credited Service. 
(2)  The request for Credited Service for FMLA leave time for the twelve (12) month period prior to each March 1 and payment of professional fees shall be made on or before March 31. 
(3)  Payment by the Member of the required amount shall be made on or before April 30 for the preceding twelve (12) month period ending March 1 and shall be made in one lump sum payment upon receipt of which Credited Service shall be issued. 
(4)  Credited Service purchased pursuant to this Section shall not count toward vesting. 
(Ord. No. 2843, § 1, 8-16-06) 
Section 27. - Prior fire service. 
    Unless otherwise prohibited by law, and except as provided for in section (1), the years or fractional parts of years that a member previously served as a firefighter with the city during a period of previous employment and for which period accumulated contributions were withdrawn from the fund, or the years and fractional parts of years that a member served as a full-time firefighter for any other municipal, county or special district fire department in the State of Florida shall be added to his years of credited service provided that: 
(1)  The member contributes to the Fund the sum that he would have contributed, based on his salary and the member contribution rate in effect at the time that the credited service is requested, had he been a member of the system for the years or fractional parts of years for which he is requesting credit plus amounts actuarially determined such that the crediting of service does not result in any cost to the Fund plus payment of costs for all professional services rendered to the board in connection with the purchase of years of credited service. 
(2)  Multiple requests to purchase credited service pursuant to this section may be made at any time prior to retirement. 
(3)  Payment by the member of the required amount shall be made within six (6) months of his request for credit, but not later than the retirement date, and shall be made in one (1) lump sum payment upon receipt of which credited service shall be given. 
(4)  The maximum credit under this section for service other than with the City of Bradenton shall be five (5) years of credited service and shall count for all purposes, except vesting and eligibility for not-in-line of duty disability benefits. There shall be no maximum purchase of credit for prior service with the City of Bradenton and such credit shall count for all purposes, including vesting. 
(5)  In no event, however, may credited service be purchased pursuant to this section for prior service with any other municipal, county or special district fire department, if such prior service forms or will form the basis of a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan as set forth in Section 15, Subsection (12)(b). 
(6)  For purposes of determining credit for prior service as a firefighter as provided for in this section, in addition to service as a firefighter in this state, credit may be purchased by the member in the same manner as provided above for federal, other state, county or municipal service if the prior service is recognized by the Division of State Fire Marshal, as provided under Chapter 633, Florida Statutes, or the firefighter provides proof to the board that such service is equivalent to the service required to meet the definition of a firefighter under Section 1, Definitions. 
(Ord. No. 2843, § 1, 8-16-06; Ord. No. 2910, § 15, 1-27-10; Ord. No. 2981, § 8, 4-27-16) 
Section 28. - Reemployment after retirement. 
(1)  Any retiree under this system may be reemployed by any public or private employer, and may receive compensation from that employment without limiting or restricting in any way the retirement benefits payable under this system. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, reemployment by the City shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this section. 
(2)  After normal retirement. Any retiree who is retired under normal (or early) retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed as a firefighter and, by virtue of that reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, shall upon being reemployed, discontinue receipt of benefits. Upon reemployment, the member shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional credited service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final retirement. Calculations of benefits upon retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation, and credited service (and early retirement reduction factor, if applicable) as of that date and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation (based only on the subsequent employment period), and credited service (and early retirement reduction factor, if applicable) as of the date of subsequent retirement. The amount of any death or disability benefit received during a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the retiree may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable only to the subsequent retirement benefit. 
(3)  Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system who is reemployed by the City in a position other than as a firefighter, shall upon being reemployed, continue receipt of benefits for the period of any subsequent employment period. 
(4)  After early retirement. Any retiree who is retired under early retirement pursuant to this system and who subsequently becomes an employee of the City in any capacity, shall discontinue receipt of benefits from the system. If the reemployed person, by virtue of his reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, that person shall accrue a second benefit as provided for in subsection (2) above and benefit payments shall remain suspended during any such subsequent employment period. If the reemployed person is not eligible to participate in this system, that person's pension benefit payments shall be suspended until the earlier of termination of employment or such time as the reemployed retiree reaches the date that he would have been eligible for normal retirement under this system had he continued employment and not elected early retirement. "Normal retirement" as used in this subsection shall be the current normal retirement date provided for under this system. 
(5)  After disability retirement. 
(a)  Subject to paragraph (b) below, any retiree who is retired under Section 8, Disability ("disability retiree"), may, subject to subsection (5), physical examination requirement, of that section, be reemployed by any public or private employer, and may receive compensation from that employment without limiting or restricting in any way, the retirement benefits payable under this system. 
(b)  Any disability retiree who subsequently becomes an employee of the City in any capacity, except as a firefighter, shall discontinue receipt of disability benefits from the system for the period of any such employment. 
(c)  If a disability retiree is reemployed as a firefighter for the City, his disability benefit shall cease and Section 8, subsection (5) shall apply. 
(6)  Reemployment of terminated vested persons. Reemployed terminated vested persons shall not be subject to the provisions of this section until such time as they begin to actually receive benefits. Upon receipt of benefits, terminated vested persons shall be treated as normal or early retirees for purposes of applying the provisions of this section and their status as an early or normal retiree shall be determined by the date they elect to begin to receive their benefit. 
(7)  DROP Participants. Retirees who were in the deferred retirement option plan shall, following termination of employment after DROP participation, have the options provided for in this section for reemployment. 
(Ord. No. 2843, § 1, 8-16-06; Ord. No. 3038, § 3, 1-9-19) 
Section 29. - Deferred retirement option plan. 
(1)  Definitions. As used in this Section 29, the following definitions apply: 
(a)  "DROP"-The City of Bradenton Firefighters' Retirement System Deferred Retirement Option Plan. 
(b)  "DROP Account"-The account established for each DROP participant under subsection (3). 
(c)  "Total return of the assets" - For purposes of calculating earnings on a member's DROP account pursuant to subsection (3)(b)2.b., for each fiscal year quarter, the percentage increase (or decrease) in the interest and dividends earned on investments, including realized and unrealized gains (or losses), of the total Plan assets. 
(2)  Participation. 
(a)  Eligibility to Participate. In lieu of terminating his employment as a firefighter, any Member who is eligible for normal or early retirement under the System may elect to defer receipt of such service retirement pension and to participate in the DROP. 
(b)  Election to Participate. A Member's election to participate in the DROP must be made in writing in a time and manner determined by the Board and shall be effective on the first day of the first calendar month which is at least fifteen (15) business days after it is received by the Board. 
(c)  Period of Participation. A Member who elects to participate in the DROP under subsection (2)(b), shall participate in the DROP for a period not to exceed sixty (60) months beginning at the time his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. An election to participate in the DROP shall constitute an irrevocable election to resign from the service of the City not later than the date provided for in the previous sentence. A Member may participate only once. 
(d)  Termination of Participation. 
1.  A Member participating in the DROP shall cease participating in the DROP by: 
a.  continuing to be employed as a firefighter at the end of his period of participation in the DROP as determined under subsection (2)(c); or 
b.  terminating his employment as a firefighter. 
2.  Upon the Member's termination of participation in the DROP, pursuant to subsection a. above, all amounts provided for in subsection (3)(b), including monthly benefits and investment earnings or losses, shall cease to be transferred from the System to his DROP Account. Any amounts remaining in his DROP Account shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of subsection (4) when he terminates his employment as a firefighter. 
3.  A Member who terminates his participation in the DROP under this subsection (2)(d) shall not be permitted to again become a participant in the DROP. 
(e)  Effect of DROP Participation on the System. 
1.  A Member's Credited Service and his accrued benefit under the System shall be determined on the date his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. For purposes of determining the accrued benefit, the Member's Salary for the purposes of calculating his Average Final Compensation shall include an amount equal to any lump sum payments which would have been paid to the Member and included as Salary as defined herein, had the Member retired under normal or early retirement and not elected DROP participation. Member contributions attributable to any lump sums used in the benefit calculation and not actually received by the Member shall be deducted from the first payments to the Member's DROP Account. The Member shall not accrue any additional Credited Service or any additional benefits under the System (except for any supplemental benefit payable to DROP participants or any additional benefits provided under any cost-of-living adjustment in the System) while he is a participant in the DROP. After a Member commences participation, he shall not be permitted to again contribute to the System nor shall he be eligible for disability or pre-retirement death benefits, except as provided for in Section 28. 
2.  No amounts shall be paid to a Member from the System while the Member is a participant in the DROP. Unless otherwise specified in the System, if a Member's participation in the DROP is terminated other than by terminating his employment as a firefighter, no amounts shall be paid to him from the System until he terminates his employment as a firefighter. Unless otherwise specified in the System, amounts transferred from the System to the Member's DROP Account shall be paid directly to the Member only on the termination of his employment as a firefighter. 
(3)  Funding. 
(a)  Establishment of DROP Account. A DROP Account shall be established for each Member participating in the DROP. A Member's DROP Account shall consist of amounts transferred to the DROP under subsection (3)(b), and earnings or interest on those amounts. 
(b)  Transfers From Retirement System. 
1.  As of the first day of each month of a Member's period of participation in the DROP, the monthly retirement benefit he would have received under the System had he terminated his employment as a firefighter and elected to receive monthly benefit payments thereunder shall be transferred to his DROP Account, except as otherwise provided for in subsection (2)(d)2. A Member's period of participation in the DROP shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of subsections (2)(c) and (2)(d), but in no event shall it continue past the date he terminates his employment as a firefighter. 
2.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (2)(d)2., a Member's DROP Account under this subsection (3)(b) shall be debited or credited with either: 
a.  Interest at an effective rate of six and one-half percent (6.5%) per annum compounded monthly determined on the last business day of the prior month's ending balance and credited to the Member's DROP Account at the end of each month (to be applicable to all current and future DROP participants); or 
b.  Earnings, to be credited or debited to the Member's DROP Account, determined as of the last business day of each fiscal year quarter and debited or credited as of such date, determined as follows: 
The average daily balance in a Member's DROP Account shall be credited or debited at a rate equal to the actual net rate of investment return realized by the System for that quarter. "Net investment return" for the purpose of this paragraph is the total return of the assets in which the Member's DROP Account is invested by the Board net of brokerage commissions, transaction costs and management fees. 
For purposes of calculating earnings on a member's DROP account pursuant to this subsection (3)(b)2.b., brokerage commissions, transaction costs, and management fees shall be determined for each quarter by the investment consultant pursuant to contracts with fund managers as reported in the custodial statement. The investment consultant shall report these quarterly contractual fees to the board. The investment consultant shall also report the net investment return for each manager and the net investment return for the total plan assets. 
Upon electing participation in the DROP, the Member shall elect to receive either interest or earnings on his account to be determined a [as] provided above. The Member may, in writing, elect to change his election only once during his DROP participation. An election to change must be made prior to the end of a quarter and shall be effective beginning the following quarter. 
3.  A Member's DROP Account shall only be credited or debited with earnings or interest and monthly benefits while the Member is a participant in the DROP and after the Member dies, retires or terminates his employment as a firefighter. If a Member is employed by the City of Bradenton Fire Department as a firefighter after electing to cease participation in the DROP pursuant to subsection (2)(d)1.a. or after participating in the DROP for five (5) years, then beginning with the next payment following cessation of participation or beginning with the Member's sixty-first (61st) month of DROP participation, whichever occurs first, the Member's DROP Account will no longer be credited or debited with earnings or interest, nor will monthly benefits be transferred to the DROP Account. All such non-transferred amounts shall be forfeited and continue to be forfeited while the Member is employed by the City of Bradenton Fire Department. A Member employed by the City of Bradenton Fire Department after five (5) years of DROP participation will still not be eligible for pre-retirement death or disability benefits, nor will he accrue additional Credited Service, except as provided for in Section 28. 
(4)  Distribution of DROP Accounts on Termination of Employment. 
(a)  Eligibility for Benefits. A Member shall receive the balance in his DROP Account in accordance with the provisions of this subsection (4) upon his termination of employment as a firefighter. Except as provided in subsection (4)(e), no amounts shall be paid to a Member from the DROP prior to his termination of employment as a firefighter. 
(b)  Form of Distribution. 
1.  Unless the Member elects otherwise, distribution of his DROP Account shall be made in a cash lump sum, subject to the direct rollover provisions set forth in subsection (4)(f). Elections under this paragraph shall be in writing and shall be made in such time or manner as the Board shall determine. 
2.  Notwithstanding the preceding, if a Member dies before his benefit is paid, his DROP Account shall be paid to his Beneficiary in such optional form as his Beneficiary may select. If no Beneficiary designation is made, the DROP Account shall be distributed to the Member's estate. 
(c)  Date of Payment of Distribution. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (4), distribution of a Member's DROP Account shall be made as soon as administratively practicable following the Member's termination of employment. Distribution of the amount in a Member's DROP account will not be made unless the Member completes a written request for distribution and a written election, on forms designated by the Board, to either receive a cash lump sum or a rollover of the lump sum amount. 
(d)  Proof of Death and Right of Beneficiary or Other Person. The Board may require and rely upon such proof of death and such evidence of the right of any Beneficiary or other person to receive the value of a deceased Member's DROP Account as the Board may deem proper and its determination of the right of that Beneficiary or other person to receive payment shall be conclusive. 
(e)  Distribution Limitation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection (4), all distributions from the DROP shall conform to the "Minimum Distribution Of Benefits" provisions as provided for herein. 
(f)  Direct Rollover of Certain Distributions. This subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the DROP to the contrary, a distributee may elect to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid in a direct rollover as otherwise provided under the System in Section 25. 
(5)  Administration of DROP. 
(a)  Board Administers the DROP. The general administration of the DROP, the responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the DROP and the responsibility of overseeing the investment of the DROP's assets shall be placed in the Board. The members of the Board may appoint from their number such subcommittees with such powers as they shall determine; may adopt such administrative procedures and regulations as they deem desirable for the conduct of their affairs; may authorize one or more of their number or any agent to execute or deliver any instrument or make any payment on their behalf; may retain counsel, employ agents and provide for such clerical, accounting, actuarial and consulting services as they may require in carrying out the provisions of the DROP; and may allocate among themselves or delegate to other persons all or such portion of their duties under the DROP, other than those granted to them as Trustee under any trust agreement adopted for use in implementing the DROP, as they, in their sole discretion, shall decide. A Trustee shall not vote on any question relating exclusively to himself. 
(b)  Individual Accounts, Records and Reports. The Board shall maintain records showing the operation and condition of the DROP, including records showing the individual balances in each Member's DROP Account, and the Board shall keep in convenient form such data as may be necessary for the valuation of the assets and liabilities of the DROP. The Board shall prepare and distribute to Members participating in the DROP and other individuals or filed with the appropriate governmental agencies, as the case may be, all necessary descriptions, reports, information returns, and data required to be distributed or filed for the DROP pursuant to the Code and any other applicable laws. 
(c)  Establishment of Rules. Subject to the limitations of the DROP, the Board from time to time shall establish rules for the administration of the DROP and the transaction of its business. The Board shall have discretionary authority to construe and interpret the DROP (including but not limited to determination of an individual's eligibility for DROP participation, the right and amount of any benefit payable under the DROP and the date on which any individual ceases to be a participant in the DROP). The determination of the Board as to the interpretation of the DROP or its determination of any disputed questions shall be conclusive and final to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
(d)  Limitation of Liability. 
1.  The Trustees shall not incur any liability individually or on behalf of any other individuals for any act or failure to act, made in good faith in relation to the DROP or the funds of the DROP. 
2.  Neither the Board nor any Trustee of the Board shall be responsible for any reports furnished by any expert retained or employed by the Board, but they shall be entitled to rely thereon as well as on certificates furnished by an accountant or an actuary, and on all opinions of counsel. The Board shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in reliance upon such expert, accountant, actuary or counsel, and all actions taken or suffered in such reliance shall be conclusive upon any person with any interest in the DROP. 
(6)  General Provisions. 
(a)  The DROP is not a separate retirement plan. Instead, it is a program under which a Member who is eligible for normal or early retirement under the System may elect to accrue future retirement benefits in the manner provided in this Section 29 for the remainder of his employment, rather than in the normal manner provided under the plan. Upon termination of employment, a Member is entitled to a lump sum distribution of his or her DROP account balance or may elect a rollover. The DROP account distribution is in addition to the Member's monthly benefit. 
(b)  Notional account. The DROP account established for such a Member is a notional account, used only for the purpose of calculation of the DROP distribution amount. It is not a separate account in the System. There is no change in the System's assets, and there is no distribution available to the Member until the Member's termination from the DROP. The Member has no control over the investment of the DROP account. 
(c)  No employer discretion. The DROP benefit is determined pursuant to a specific formula which does not involve employer discretion. 
(d)  IRC limit. The DROP account distribution, along with other benefits payable from the System, is subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b). 
(e)  Amendment of DROP. The DROP may be amended by an ordinance of the City at any time and from time to time, and retroactively if deemed necessary or appropriate, to amend in whole or in part any or all of the provisions of the DROP. However, except as otherwise provided by law, no amendment shall make it possible for any part of the DROP's funds to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of persons entitled to benefits under the DROP. No amendment shall be made which has the effect of decreasing the balance of the DROP Account of any Member. 
(f)  Facility of Payment. If a Member or other person entitled to a benefit under the DROP is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident or is a minor, the Board may direct that any benefit due him shall be made only to a duly appointed legal representative. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of the liabilities of the DROP for that benefit. 
(g)  Information. Each Member, Beneficiary or other person entitled to a benefit, before any benefit shall be payable to him or on his account under the DROP, shall file with the Board the information that it shall require to establish his rights and benefits under the DROP. 
(h)  Written Elections, Notification. 
1.  Any elections, notifications or designations made by a Member pursuant to the provisions of the DROP shall be made in writing and filed with the Board in a time and manner determined by the Board under rules uniformly applicable to all employees similarly situated. The Board reserves the right to change from the time and manner for making notifications, elections or designations by Members under the DROP if it determines after due deliberation that such action is justified in that it improves the administration of the DROP. In the event of a conflict between the provisions for making an election, notification or designation set forth in the DROP and such new administrative procedures, those new administrative procedures shall prevail. 
2.  Each Member or Retiree who has a DROP Account shall be responsible for furnishing the Board with his current address and any subsequent changes in his address. Any notice required to be given to a Member or Retiree hereunder shall be deemed given if directed to him at the last such address given to the Board and mailed by registered or certified United States mail. If any check mailed by registered or certified United States mail to such address is returned, mailing of checks will be suspended until such time as the Member or Retiree notifies the Board of his address. 
(i)  Benefits Not Guaranteed. All benefits payable to a Member from the DROP shall be paid only from the assets of the Member's DROP Account and neither the City nor the Board shall have any duty or liability to furnish the DROP with any funds, securities or other assets except to the extent required by any applicable law. 
(j)  Construction. 
1.  The DROP shall be construed, regulated and administered under the laws of Florida, except where other applicable law controls. 
2.  The titles and headings of the subsections in this Section 29 are for convenience only. In the case of ambiguity or inconsistency, the text rather than the titles or headings shall control. 
(k)  Forfeiture of Retirement Benefits. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to remove DROP participants from the scope of Section 21 and 22 above or F.S. § 112.3173. DROP participants who commit a specified offense or whose employment is terminated as described in Section 21 while employed, will be subject to forfeiture of all retirement benefits, including DROP benefits, pursuant to the above provisions of law. 
(l)  Effect of DROP participation on employment. Participation in the DROP is not a guarantee of employment and DROP participants shall be subject to the same employment standards and policies that are applicable to employees who are not DROP participants. 
(Ord. No. 2843, § 1, 8-16-06; Ord. No. 2910, § 16, 1-27-10; Ord. No. 2968, § 3, 6-25-15; Ord. No. 2981, § 9, 4-27-16; Ord. No. 3038, § 4, 1-9-19) 
Section 30. - Supplemental benefit component for special benefits; chapter 175 share accounts. 
    There is hereby established an additional plan component to provide special benefits in the form of a supplemental retirement, termination, death and disability benefits to be in addition to the benefits provided for in the previous Sections of this plan, such benefit to be funded solely and entirely by F.S. ch. 175, premium tax monies for each Plan Year which are allocated to this supplemental component as provided for in F.S. § 175.351. Amounts allocated to this supplemental component ("Share Plan"), if any, shall be further allocated to the members and DROP participants as follows: 
(1)  Individual Member Share Accounts. The board shall create individual "Member Share Accounts" for all actively employed plan Members and DROP participants and maintain appropriate books and records showing the respective interest of each Member or DROP participant hereunder. Each Member or DROP participant shall have a Member Share Account for his share of the F.S. ch. 175 tax revenues described above, forfeitures and income and expense adjustments relating thereto. The board shall maintain separate Member Share Accounts, however, the maintenance of separate accounts is for accounting purposes only and a segregation of the assets of the trust fund to each account shall not be required or permitted. 
(2)  Share Account Funding. 
(a)  Individual Member Share Accounts shall be established as of September 30, 2016 for all Members and DROP participants who were actively employed as of October 1, 2015. Individual Member Share Accounts shall be credited with an allocation as provided for in the following subsection (3) of any premium tax monies which have been allocated to the Share Plan for that Plan Year, beginning with the Plan Year ending September 30, 2016. 
(b)  Any forfeitures as provided in subsection (4), shall be used as part of future allocations to the individual Member Share Accounts in accordance with the formula set forth in subsection (3)(a). 
(3)  Allocation of Monies to Share Accounts. 
(a)  Allocation of Chapter 175 Contributions. 
1.  Effective as of September 30, 2016, the amount of any premium tax monies allocated to the Share Plan shall be allocated to individual Member Share Accounts as provided for in this subsection. Members retiring on or after October 1, 2015 and prior to September 30, 2016 shall receive an allocation. In addition, all premium tax monies allocated to the Share Plan in any subsequent Plan Year shall also be allocated as provided for in this subsection. Available premium tax monies shall be allocated to individual Member Share Accounts at the end of each Plan Year on September 30 (a "valuation date"). 
2.  On each valuation date, each current actively employed Member of the plan not participating in the DROP, each DROP participant and each Retiree who retires or DROP participant who has terminated DROP participation in the Plan Year ending on the valuation date (including each disability Retiree), or Beneficiary of a deceased Member (not including terminated vested persons) who is otherwise eligible for an allocation as of the valuation date shall receive a share allocation as follows: 
3.  The total funds subject to allocation on each valuation date shall be divided equally among those persons eligible for an allocation and allocated to the Member Share Account of those eligible for an allocation. 
4.  Re-employed Retirees shall be deemed new employees and shall receive an allocation based solely on the Credited Service in the reemployment period. 
(b)  Allocation of Investment Gains and Losses. On each valuation date, each individual Member Share Account shall be adjusted to reflect the net earnings or losses resulting from investments during the year. The net earnings or losses allocated to the individual Member Share Accounts shall be the same percentage which is earned or lost by the total plan investments, including realized and unrealized gains or losses, net of brokerage commissions, transaction costs and management fees. 
Net earnings or losses are determined as of the last business day of the fiscal year, which is the valuation date, and are debited or credited as of such date. 
For purposes of calculating net earnings or losses on a Member's Share Account pursuant to this subsection, brokerage commissions, transaction costs, and management fees for the immediately preceding fiscal year shall be determined for each year by the investment consultant pursuant to contracts with fund managers as reported in the custodial statement. The investment consultant shall report these annual contractual fees to the Board. The investment consultant shall also report the net investment return for each manager and the net investment return for the total plan assets. 
(c)  Allocation of Costs, Fees and Expenses. On each valuation date, each individual Member Share Account shall be adjusted to allocate its pro rata share of the costs, fees and expenses of administration of the Share Plan. These fees shall be allocated to each individual Member Share Account on a proportionate basis taking the costs, fees and expenses of administration of the Share Plan as a whole multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total assets in each individual Member Share Account (after adding the annual investment gain or loss) and the denominator of which is the total assets of the fund as a whole as of the same date. 
(d)  No Right to Allocation. The fact of allocation or credit of an allocation to a Member's Share Account by the board shall not vest in any Member, any right, title, or interest in the assets of the trust or in the Chapter 175 tax revenues except at the time or times, to the extent, and subject to the terms and conditions provided in this Section. 
(e)  Members and DROP participants shall be provided annual statements setting forth their share account balance as of the end of the Plan Year. 
(4)  Forfeitures. Any Member who has less than ten (10) years of service credit and who is not otherwise eligible for payment of benefits after termination of employment with the City as provided for in subsection (5) shall forfeit his individual Member Share Account. Forfeited amounts shall be included and used as part of the Chapter 175 tax revenues for future allocations to individual Member Share Accounts on each valuation date in accordance with the formula set forth in subsection (3)(a). 
(5)  Eligibility For Benefits. Any Member (or his Beneficiary) who terminates employment as a Firefighter with the City or who dies, upon application filed with the Board, shall be entitled to be paid the value of his individual Member Share Account, subject to the following criteria: 
(a)  Retirement Benefit. 
1.  A Member shall be entitled to one hundred percent (100%) of the value of his share account upon normal or early retirement pursuant to Section 6, or if the Member enters the DROP, upon termination of employment. 
2.  Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (6). 
(b)  Termination Benefit. 
1.  In the event that a Member's employment as a Firefighter is terminated by reason other than retirement, death or disability, he shall be entitled to receive the value of his share account only if he is vested in accordance with Section 9. 
2.  Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (6). 
(c)  Disability Benefit. 
1.  In the event that a Member is determined to be eligible for either an in-line of duty disability benefit pursuant to Section 8, subsection (1) or a not-in-line of duty disability benefit pursuant to Section 8, subsection (3), he shall be entitled to one hundred percent (100%) of the value of his share account. 
2.  Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (6). 
(d)  Death Benefit. 
1.  In the event that a Member or DROP participant dies while actively employed as a Firefighter, one hundred percent (100%) of the value of his Member Share Account shall be paid to his designated Beneficiary as provided in Section 7. 
2.  Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (6). 
(6)  Payment of Benefits. If a Member or DROP participant terminates employment for any reason or dies and he or his Beneficiary is otherwise entitled to receive the balance in the Member's Share Account, the Member's Share Account shall be valued by the plan's actuary on the next valuation date as provided for in subsection (3) above, following termination of employment. Payment of the calculated share account balance shall be payable as soon as administratively practicable following the valuation date, but not later than one hundred fifty (150) days following the valuation date and shall be paid in one lump sum payment. No optional forms of payments shall be permitted. 
(7)  Benefits Not Guaranteed. All benefits payable under this Section 30 shall be paid only from the assets accounted for in individual Member Share Accounts. Neither the City nor the Board shall have any duty or liability to furnish any additional funds, securities or other assets to fund share account benefits. Neither the Board nor any trustee shall be liable for the making, retention, or sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of the Member Share Account balances, except due to his or its own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. All investments shall be made by the board subject to the restrictions otherwise applicable to fund investments. 
(8)  Notional account. The Member Share Account is a notional account, used only for the purpose of calculation of the share distribution amount. It is not a separate account in the System. There is no change in the system's assets, and there is no distribution available to the Member or DROP participant until the Member's or DROP participant's termination from employment. The Member or DROP participant has no control over the investment of the share account. 
(9)  No employer discretion. The share account benefit is determined pursuant to a specific formula which does not involve employer discretion. 
(10)  Maximum Additions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, annual additions under this Section shall not exceed the limitations of Section 415(c) of the code pursuant to the provisions of Section 15, subsection (11). 
(11)  IRC limit. The share account distribution, along with other benefits payable from the system, is subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b).

Obvious misspellings have been corrected without notation; a uniform system of headings, catchlines, and indentions has been used; and additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets [ ]. 

Sec. 1. - Definitions. 
(1)  As used herein, unless otherwise defined or required by the context, the following words and phrases shall have the meaning indicated: 
    Accumulated contributions means a member's own contributions without interest. For those members who purchase credited service with interest or at no cost to the system, any payment representing the amount attributable to member contributions based on the applicable member contribution rate, and any payment representing interest and any required actuarially calculated payments for the purchase of such credited service, shall be included in accumulated contributions. 
    Actuarial equivalent means a benefit or amount of equal value, based upon the RP2000 Combined Healthy Participant Mortality Table and an interest rate equal to the investment return assumption set forth in the last actuarial valuation report approved by the board. This definition may only be amended by the city pursuant to the recommendation of the board using the assumptions adopted by the board with the advice of the plan's actuary, such that actuarial assumptions are not subject to city discretion. 
    Average final compensation: 
(a)  For members hired prior to June 1, 2013 means one-twelfth (1/12) of the average salary of the: 
(1)  Two (2) best years for members with twenty (20) or more years of credited service; or

    Beneficiary means the person or persons entitled to receive benefits hereunder at the death of a member who has or have been designated in writing by the member and filed with the board. If no such designation is in effect, or if no person so designated is living, at the time of death of the member, the beneficiary shall be the estate of the member. 
    Board means the board of trustees, which shall administer and manage the system herein provided and serve as trustees of the fund. 
    City means City of Bradenton, Florida. 
    Code means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. 
    Credited service means the total number of years and fractional parts of years of service as a police officer with member contributions, when required, omitting intervening years or fractional parts of years when such member was not employed by the city as a police officer. A member may voluntarily leave his accumulated contributions in the fund for a period of five (5) years after leaving the employ of the police department pending the possibility of being re-employed as a police officer without losing credit for the time that he was a member of the system. If a vested member leaves the employ of the police department his accumulated contributions will be returned only upon his written request. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed as a police officer with the police department within five (5) years, his accumulated contributions, if one-thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or less, shall be returned. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed within five (5) years, his accumulated contributions, if more than one-thousand dollars ($1,000.00), will be returned only upon the written request of the member and upon completion of a written election to receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount on forms designated by the board. Upon return of a member's accumulated contributions, all of his rights and benefits under the system are forfeited and terminated. Upon any reemployment, a police officer shall not receive credit for the years and fractional parts of years of service for which he has withdrawn his accumulated contributions from the fund, unless the police officer repays into the fund the contributions he has withdrawn, with interest, as determined by the board, within ninety (90) days after his reemployment. 
    The years or fractional parts of years that a member performs "Qualified Military Service" consisting of voluntary or involuntary "service in the uniformed services" as defined in the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) (P.L.103-353), after separation from employment as a police officer with the city to perform training or service, shall be added to his years of credited service for all purposes, including vesting, provided that: 
(a)  The member is entitled to reemployment under the provisions of USERRA. 
(b)  The member returns to his employment as a police officer within one (1) year from the earlier of the date of his military discharge or release from active service, unless otherwise required by USERRA. 
(c)  The maximum credit for military service pursuant to this paragraph shall be five (5) years. 
(d)  This paragraph is intended to satisfy the minimum requirements of USERRA. To the extent that this paragraph does not meet the minimum standards of USERRA, as it may be amended from time to time, the minimum standards shall apply. 
    In the event a Member dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing USERRA Qualified Military Service, the beneficiaries of the Member are entitled to any benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) as if the Member had resumed employment and then died while employed. 
    Beginning January 1, 2009, to the extent required by section 414(u)(12) of the code, an individual receiving differential wage payments (as defined under section 3401(h)(2) of the code) from an employer shall be treated as employed by that employer, and the differential wage payment shall be treated as compensation for purposes of applying the limits on annual additions under section 415(c) of the code. This provision shall be applied to all similarly situated individuals in a reasonably equivalent manner. 
    Leave conversions of unused accrued paid time off shall not be permitted to be applied toward the accrual of credited service either during each plan year of a member's employment with the city or in the plan year in which the member terminates employment. 
    Fund means the trust fund established herein as part of the system. 
    Issue means children of the member, including legally adopted children, but shall not include any child who reaches or who has reached his eighteenth birthday, becomes self-supporting, marries or dies. 
    Member means an actively employed police officer who fulfills the prescribed membership requirements. Benefit improvements which, in the past, have been provided for by amendments to the system adopted by city ordinance and any benefit improvements which might be made in the future shall apply prospectively and shall not apply to members who terminate employment or who retire prior to the effective date of any ordinance adopting such benefit improvements, unless such ordinance specifically provides to the contrary. 
    Plan year means the twelve-month period beginning October 1 and ending September 30 of the following year. 
    Police officer means an actively employed full-time person employed by the city, including his initial probationary employment period, who is certified as a police officer as a condition of employment in accordance with the provisions of § 943.1395, Florida Statutes, who is vested with authority to bear arms and make arrests, and whose primary responsibility is the prevention and detection of crime or the enforcement of the penal, traffic, or highway laws of the State of Florida. 
    Retiree means a member who has entered retirement status. 
    Retirement means a member's separation from city employment with eligibility for immediate receipt of benefits under the system or entry into the Deferred Retirement Option Plan. 
    Salary means the total compensation for services rendered to the city as a police officer, reportable on the member's W-2 form plus all tax-deferred, tax-sheltered or tax-exempt items of income derived from elective employee payroll deductions or salary reductions, but excluding "Contracted Special Details." Compensation in excess of the limitations set forth in § 401(a)(17) of the Code as of the first day of the plan year shall be disregarded for any purpose, including employee contributions or any benefit calculations. The annual compensation of each member taken into account in determining benefits or employee contributions for any plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, may not exceed $200,000, as adjusted for cost-of-living increases in accordance with Code Section 401(a)(17)(B). Compensation means compensation during the fiscal year. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination period that begins with or within such calendar year. If the determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the annual compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period, and the denominator of which is 12. If the compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a member's contributions or benefits for the current plan year, the compensation for such prior determination period is subject to the applicable annual compensation limit in effect for that prior period. The limitation on compensation for an "eligible employee" shall not be less than the amount which was allowed to be taken into account hereunder as in effect on July 1, 1993. "Eligible employee" is an individual who was a member before the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1995. 
    As of June 30, 2013, the Bradenton Police Retirement System Board of Trustees shall assign each employee a maximum pensionable unused sick/vacation payout. This amount shall be obtained using the following formula: member's current hourly rate times current vacation leave balance plus member's current hourly rate times one half (1/2) current sick leave balance. This shall determine the maximum amount of payment for unused leave that shall be considered pensionable upon the employees' retirement. The pension board shall distribute each member's calculated maximum pensionable unused sick/vacation payout to each member and to the City for record keeping. For service earned after June 30, 2013, salary shall not include more than three hundred (300) hours of overtime per calendar year. Provided however, in any event, payments for overtime in excess of three hundred (300) hours per year accrued as of June 30, 2013 and attributable to service earned prior to the June 30, 2013, may still be included in salary for pension purposes even if the payment is not actually made until on or after June 30, 2013. 
    Spouse means the member's or retiree's spouse under the applicable law at the time benefits become payable. 
    System means the City of Bradenton Police Officers' Retirement System as contained herein and all amendments thereto. 
(2)  Masculine gender. The masculine gender, where used herein, unless the context specifically requires otherwise, shall include both the feminine and masculine genders.

Sec. 2. - Membership. 
(1)  Conditions of eligibility : All police officers, as of April 27, 1994, and all future new police officers shall become members of this system as a condition of employment. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, a new employee who is hired as the Police Chief may, upon employment as Police Chief, notify the board and the City, in writing, of his election to not be a member of the system. Current employees of the City who are selected to become Police Chief are not eligible for the opt-out provided for herein. In the event of any such election, he shall be barred from future membership in the system and any contributions made after employment and prior to opting out shall be refunded.

Each member trustee shall serve as trustee for a period of four (4) years, unless he sooner leaves the employment of the city as a police officer or otherwise vacates his office as trustee, whereupon a successor shall be chosen in the same manner as the departing trustee. Each trustee may succeed himself in office. DROP participants may be elected as but may not vote for elected trustees. The board shall establish and administer the nominating and election procedures for each election. The board shall meet at least quarterly each year. The board shall be a legal entity with, in addition to other powers and responsibilities contained herein, the power to bring and defend lawsuits of every kind, nature, and description. 
(2)  The trustees shall, by a majority vote, elect a chairman and a secretary. The secretary of the board shall keep a complete minute book of the actions, proceedings, or hearings of the board.

In the event the board chooses to use the city's legal counsel, actuary or other professional, technical or other advisors, it shall do so only under terms and conditions acceptable to the board. 
(5)  The duties and responsibilities of the board shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following:

Sec. 4. - Finances and fund management; establishment and operation of fund. 
(1)  As part of the system, there exists the fund, into which shall be deposited all of the contributions and assets whatsoever attributable to the system. 
(2)  The actual custody and supervision of the fund (and assets thereof) shall be vested in the board. Payment of benefits and disbursements from the fund shall be made by the disbursing agent but only upon written authorization from the board. 
(3)  All funds of the police officers' retirement system may be deposited by the board with the treasurer of the city, acting in a ministerial capacity only, who shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as he is liable for the safekeeping of funds for the city. However, any funds so deposited with the treasurer of the city shall be kept in a separate fund by the treasurer or clearly identified as such funds of the police officers' retirement system. In lieu thereof, the board shall deposit the funds of the police officers' retirement system in a qualified public depository as defined in § 280.02, Florida Statutes, which depository with regard to such funds shall conform to and be bound by all of the provisions of chapter 280, Florida Statutes. In order to fulfill its investment responsibilities as set forth herein, the board may retain the services of a custodian bank, an investment advisor registered under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 or otherwise exempt from such required registration, an insurance company, or a combination of these, for the purposes of investment decisions and management. Such investment manager shall have discretion, subject to any guidelines as prescribed by the board, in the investment of all fund assets. 
(4)  All funds and securities of the system may be commingled in the fund, provided that accurate records are maintained at all times reflecting the financial composition of the fund, including accurate current accounts and entries as regards the following: 
(a)  Current amounts of accumulated contributions of members on both an individual and aggregate account basis; and 
(b)  Receipts and disbursements; and 
(c)  Benefit payments; and 
(d)  Current amounts clearly reflecting all monies, funds and assets whatsoever attributable to contributions and deposits from the city; and 
(e)  All interest, dividends and gains (or losses) whatsoever; and 
(f)  Such other entries as may be properly required so as to reflect a clear and complete financial report of the fund. 
(5)  An audit shall be performed annually by a certified public accountant for the most recent fiscal year of the system showing a detailed listing of assets and a statement of all income and disbursements during the year. Such income and disbursements must be reconciled with the assets at the beginning and end of the year. Such report shall reflect a complete evaluation of assets on both a cost and market basis, as well as other items normally included in a certified audit. 
(6)  The board shall have the following investment powers and authority: 
(a)  The board shall be vested with full legal title to said fund, subject, however, and in any event to the authority and power of the Bradenton City Council to amend or terminate this fund; provided, that no amendment or fund termination shall ever result in the use of any assets of this fund except for the payment of regular expenses and benefits under this system, except as otherwise provided herein. All contributions from time to time paid into the fund, and the income thereof, without distinction between principal and income, shall be held and administered by the board or its agent in the fund and the board shall not be required to segregate or invest separately any portion of the fund. 
(b)  All monies paid into or held in the fund shall be invested and reinvested by the Board and the investment of all or any part of such funds shall be subject to the following: 
1.  Notwithstanding any limitation provided for in F.S. ch. 185, to the contrary (unless such limitation may not be amended by local ordinance) or any limitation in prior city ordinances to the contrary, all monies paid into or held in the fund may be invested and reinvested in such securities, investment vehicles or property wherever situated and of whatever kind, as shall be approved by the board, including, but not limited to common or preferred stocks, bonds, and other evidences of indebtedness or ownership. In no event, however, shall more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the assets of the fund at market value be invested in foreign securities. 
2.  The board shall develop and about a written investment policy statement setting forth permissible types of investments, goals and objectives of investments and setting quality and quantity limitations on investments in accordance with the recommendations of its investment consultants. The investment policy statement shall be reviewed by the board at least annually. 
3.  In addition, the board may, upon recommendation by the board's investment consultant, make investments in group trusts meeting the requirements of Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 81-100, Revenue Ruling 2011-1, IRS Notice 2012-6 and Revenue Ruling 2014-24 or successor rulings or guidance of similar import, and operated or maintained exclusively for the commingling and collective investment of monies, provided that the funds in the group trust consist exclusively of trust assets held under plans qualified under section 401(a) of the code, individual retirement accounts that are exempt under section 408(e) of the code, eligible governmental plans that meet the requirements of section 457(b) of the code, and governmental plans under 401(a)(24) of the code. For this purpose, a trust includes a custodial account or separate tax favored account maintained by an insurance company that is treated as a trust under section 401(f) or under section 457(g)(3) of the code. While any portion of the assets of the fund are invested in such a group trust, such group trust is itself adopted as a part of the system or plan. 
a.  Any collective or common group trust to which assets of the fund are transferred pursuant to subsection c. shall be adopted by the board as part of the plan by executing appropriate participation, adoption agreements, and/or trust agreements with the group trust's trustee. 
b.  The separate account maintained by the group trust for the plan pursuant to subsection c. shall not be used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than for the exclusive benefit of the members and beneficiaries of the plan. 
c.  For purposes of valuation, the value of the separate account maintained by the group trust for the plan shall be the fair market value of the portion of the group trust held for the plan, determined in accordance with generally recognized valuation procedures. 
(c)  At least once every three (3) years, and more often as determined by the board, the board shall retain a professionally qualified independent consultant, as defined in § 185.06, Florida Statutes, to evaluate the performance of all current investment managers and make recommendations regarding the retention of all such investment managers. These recommendations shall be considered by the board at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
(d)  The board may retain in cash and keep unproductive of income such amount of the fund as it may deem advisable, having regard for the cash requirements of the system. 
(e)  Neither the board nor any trustee shall be liable for the making, retention or sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of the fund, except that due to his or its own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. 
(f)  The board may cause any investment in securities held by it to be registered in or transferred into its name as trustee or into the name of such nominee as it may direct, or it may retain them unregistered and in form permitting transferability, but the books and records shall at all times show that all investments are part of the fund. 
(g)  The board is empowered, but is not required, to vote upon any stocks, bonds, or securities of any corporation, association, or trust and to give general or specific proxies or powers of attorney with or without power of substitution; to participate in mergers, reorganizations, recapitalizations, consolidations, and similar transactions with respect to such securities; to deposit such stock or other securities in any voting trust or any protective or like committee with the trustees or with depositories designated thereby; to amortize or fail to amortize any part or all of the premium or discount resulting from the acquisition or disposition of assets; and generally to exercise any of the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, or other investments comprising the fund which it may deem to be to the best interest of the fund to exercise. 
(h)  The board shall not be required to make any inventory or appraisal or report to any court, nor to secure any order of court for the exercise of any power contained herein. 
(i)  Where any action which the board is required to take or any duty or function which it is required to perform either under the terms herein or under the general law applicable to it as trustee under this ordinance can reasonably be taken or performed only after receipt by it from a member, the city, or any other entity of specific information, certification, direction or instructions, the board shall be free of liability in failing to take such action or perform such duty or function until such information, certification, direction or instruction has been received by it. 
(j)  Any overpayments or underpayments from the fund to a member, retiree or beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate per annum approved by the board in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member, retiree or beneficiary was correctly entitled to shall be paid. Overpayments shall be charged against payments next succeeding the correction or collected in another manner if prudent. Underpayments shall be made up from the fund in a prudent manner. 
(k)  The board shall sustain no liability whatsoever for the sufficiency of the fund to meet the payments and benefits provided for herein. 
(l)  In any application to or proceeding or action in the courts, only the board shall be a necessary party and no member or other person having an interest in the fund shall be entitled to any notice or service of process. Any judgment entered in such a proceeding or action shall be conclusive upon all persons. 
(m)  Any of the foregoing powers and functions reposed in the board may be performed or carried out by the board through duly authorized agents, provided that the board at all times maintains continuous supervision over the acts of any such agent; provided further, that legal title to said fund shall always remain in the board. 
(Ord. No. 2509, § 4, 4-27-94; Ord. No. 2577, § 2, 3-25-98; Ord. No. 2621, §§ 1, 2, 3-8-00; Ord. No. 2740, § 1, 1-14-04; Ord. No. 2914, § 1, 2-10-10; Ord. No. 2928, § 1, 2-23-11; Ord. No. 2944, § 1, 12-12-12; Ord. No. 2965, 9-10-14; Ord. No. 3020, § 3, 2-28-18) 
Sec. 5. - Contributions. 
(1)  Member contributions: 
(a)  Amount. Each member of the system shall be required to make regular contributions to the fund in the amount of six percent (6%) of his salary. Beginning with the first full pay period after March 6, 2014, each member of the system shall be required to make regular contributions to the fund in the amount of seven and half percent (7.5%). Beginning with the first full pay period in October 2014, each member of the system shall be required to make regular contributions to the fund in the amount of nine percent (9%). Member contributions withheld by the city on behalf of the member shall be deposited with the board immediately after each pay period. The contributions made by each member to the fund shall be designated as employer contributions pursuant to § 414(h) of the Code. Such designation is contingent upon the contributions being excluded from the members' gross income for Federal Income Tax purposes. For all other purposes of the system, such contributions shall be considered to be member contributions. 
(b)  Method. Such contributions shall be made by payroll deduction. 
(2)  State contributions. Any monies received or receivable by reason of laws of the State of Florida for the express purpose of funding and paying for retirement benefits for police officers of the city shall be deposited in the fund comprising part of this system immediately and under no circumstances more than five (5) days after receipt by the city. 
(3)  City contributions. So long as this system is in effect, the city shall make quarterly contributions to the fund in an amount equal to the required city contribution, as shown by the applicable actuarial valuation of the system, but in no event shall the city's annual contribution be less than eight percent (8%) of the total salary of the members. 
(4)  Other. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the fund, but such deposits must be accounted for separately and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis. Funds arising from these sources may be used only for additional benefits for members, as determined by the board, and may not be used to reduce what would have otherwise been required city contributions. 
(Ord. No. 2509, § 5, 4-27-94; Ord. No. 2621, §§ 1, 2, 3-8-00; Ord. No. 2776, § 1, 2-23-05; Ord. No. 2914, § 1, 2-10-10; Ord. No. 2963, § 2, 5-28-14) 
Sec. 6. - Benefit amounts and eligibility. 
(1)  Normal retirement age and date. For member's hired prior to June 1, 2013, the normal retirement age is the earlier of the attainment of age forty-five (45) and the completion of twenty (20) years of credited service or the attainment of age fifty-five (55) and the completion of ten (10) years of credited service. For member's hired on or after June 1, 2013, the normal retirement age is the attainment of age fifty (50) and the completion of twenty-five (25) years of credited service or the attainment of age fifty-five (55) and the completion of ten (10) years of credited service. Each member shall become one hundred percent (100%) vested in his accrued benefit at normal retirement age. A member's normal retirement date shall be the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date the member retires from the city after attaining normal retirement age. 
(2)  Normal retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on or after his normal retirement date shall receive a monthly benefit which shall commence on the first day of the month coincident with or next following his retirement and be continued thereafter during the member's lifetime. Upon the death of a member retired or eligible for retirement (see section 7), the member's spouse, if any, shall receive the same benefit the member was receiving or could have been receiving immediately prior to his death, plus twenty dollars ($20.00) for each of the member's issue. The monthly payments to the spouse shall cease upon the death or remarriage of the spouse. The monthly retirement benefit for members hired prior to June 1, 2013 shall equal three percent (3%) of average final compensation for each year of credited service. The monthly retirement benefit for members hired on or after June 1, 2013 shall equal two and three quarters percent (2.75%) of average final compensation for each year of credited service. In addition, members who retire with twenty (20) or more years of credited service shall receive an additional monthly amount equal to ten dollars ($10.00) for each year of credited service. 
(3)  Early retirement date. A member may retire on his early retirement date which shall be the first day of any month coincident with or next following the attainment of age fifty (50) and the completion of ten (10) years of credited service. Early retirement under the system is retirement from employment with the city on or after the early retirement date and prior to the normal retirement date. 
(4)  Early retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on his early retirement date may receive either a deferred or an immediate monthly retirement benefit payable in the same form as for normal retirement as follows: 
(a)  A deferred monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on what would have been his normal retirement date had he continued employment as a police officer and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The amount of each such deferred monthly retirement benefit shall be determined in the same manner as for retirement on his normal retirement date except that credited service and average final compensation shall be determined as of his early retirement date; or 
(b)  An immediate monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on his early retirement date and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The benefit payable shall be as determined in paragraph (a) above, reduced by three percent (3%) for each year by which the commencement of benefits precedes the date which would have been the member's normal retirement date had he continued employment as a police officer. 
(5)  Cost-of-living allowance: 
(a)  The board shall, in addition to the above payments, pay to those members or their surviving spouse, if any, who retired prior to December 27, 1989, and who are receiving a normal retirement benefit or an on-duty disability benefit, the sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), payable on the first day of November of each year. 
(b)  The monthly benefits being received by all normal retirees who retire with at least twenty (20) years of credited service or on-duty disability retirees and their surviving spouses who are receiving benefits attributable to such members who were actively employed by the police department on or after December 27, 1989, and retired prior to the adoption of subsection (5)(c), below shall be increased each year on January 1 in accordance with a cost-of-living increase in that monthly benefit equal to one-half of the yearly cost-of-living increase (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Consumer Price Index (1967)) or four percent (4%), whichever is less. These retirees and surviving spouses shall not receive the increase provided for in subsection (5)(c), below. 
(c)  As of July 8, 2008, the monthly benefits being received by all future normal retirees who retire with at least twenty (20) years of credited service and on-duty disability retirees and their surviving spouses who are receiving benefits attributable to such members, shall be increased each year on January 1, if hired prior to June 1, 2013 or if hired on or after June 1, 2013 beginning at age fifty-five (55) and ending at age sixty-five (65), in accordance with a cost-of-living increase in the monthly benefit equal to two and seventy-one hundredths percent (2.71%) as a yearly cost-of-living increase. If the Chapter 185 revenue falls below the base amount, then the cost-of-living allowance will be reduced below two and seventy-one hundredths percent (2.71%) to offset the deficit. The reduced cost-of-living allowance will be determined by the plan actuary so that payment of the cost-of-living allowance results in no increase in cost to the city or to police officers. The deficit may first be offset by any Chapter 185 revenue that is in reserve. When the Chapter 185 revenue returns to the base amount, the cost-of-living allowance will increase back to two and seventy-one hundredths percent (2.71%). 
(d)  Notwithstanding subsections (5) (a), (b) and (c) above, the cost-of-living allowance shall be discontinued upon the attainment of age sixty-five (65) for all members who retire on or after February 1, 2014. 
(6)  Required distribution date. The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(Ord. No. 2509, § 6, 4-27-94; Ord. No. 2548, § 3, 11-8-95; Ord. No. 2621, §§ 1, 2, 3-8-00; Ord. No. 2644, § 1, 1-10-01; Ord. No. 2776, § 2, 2-23-05; Ord. No. 2893, § 1, 7-16-08; Ord. No. 2914, § 1, 2-10-10; Ord. No. 2958, § 2, 2-26-14; Ord. No. 2963, § 3, 5-28-14; Ord. No. 3020, § 4, 2-28-18) 
Sec. 7. - Preretirement death. 
(1)  Death on-duty. If any member shall lose his life directly in the performance of his duties as a police officer, his spouse, if any, shall receive and be paid as a monthly benefit a sum equal to three percent (3%) of the deceased member's average final compensation multiplied by his total years of credited service, but in any event, the minimum amount paid shall be sixty percent (60%) of the average final compensation of the member, with such pension to be paid for the remainder of such spouse's natural life and the fund shall pay in addition thereto the sum of twenty dollars ($20.00) per month for each of the decedent's issue. The pension benefit offered by this subsection shall be available to the spouse upon election of said spouse of this benefit in lieu of any other benefits provided by the system. 
(2)  Death off-duty. If any active member is unmarried at the time of his death and/or shall die from causes not directly connected with or attributable to the performance of his duty as a police officer, the following shall apply: 
(a)  Prior to vesting or eligibility for retirement. The beneficiary of a deceased member who was not receiving monthly benefits or who was not yet vested or eligible for normal or early retirement shall receive a refund of one hundred percent (100%) of the member's accumulated contributions. 
(b)  Deceased members vested or eligible for retirement with spouse as beneficiary. This subsection (b) applies only when the member's spouse is the sole designated beneficiary. The spouse beneficiary of any member who dies while actively employed and who, at the date of his death, was vested or eligible for normal or early retirement shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
1.  If the member was vested but not eligible for normal or early retirement, the spouse beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years, beginning on the date that the deceased member would have been eligible for normal or early retirement, at the option of the spouse beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced as for early retirement, if applicable. The spouse beneficiary may also elect to receive an immediate benefit, payable for ten (10) years, which is actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the early retirement date. 
2.  If the deceased member was eligible for normal or early retirement, his spouse, if any, shall receive a benefit payable for life or until remarriage, or if there is no surviving spouse then the spouse beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death or at the deceased member's otherwise early or normal retirement date, at the option of the spouse beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced as for early retirement, if applicable. 
3.  A spouse beneficiary may not elect an optional form of benefit; however, the board may elect to make a lump-sum payment pursuant to section 10, subsection (7). 
4.  A spouse beneficiary may, in lieu of any benefit provided for in subsection 1. or 2. above, elect to receive a refund of the deceased member's accumulated contributions. 
5.  Notwithstanding anything contained in this section to the contrary, in any event, distributions to the spouse beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date selected pursuant to the above provisions in this section that must be on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained seventy and one-half (701/2). 
6.  If the surviving spouse beneficiary commences receiving a benefit under subsection 1. or 2. above, but dies before all payments are made, the actuarial value of the remaining benefit will be paid to the spouse beneficiary's estate in a lump sum. 
(c)  Deceased members vested or eligible for retirement with non-spouse beneficiary. This subsection applies only when the member's spouse is not the beneficiary or is not the sole designated beneficiary, but there is a surviving beneficiary. The beneficiary of any member who dies and who, at the date of his death was vested or eligible for early or normal retirement, shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
1.  If the member was vested, but not eligible for normal or early retirement, the beneficiary will receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years. The benefit will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. The benefit will be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation and actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the normal retirement date. 
2.  If the deceased member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the beneficiary will receive a benefit payable for ten (10) years, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death. The benefit will be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced for early retirement, if applicable. 
3.  A beneficiary may not elect an optional form of benefit, however the board may elect to make a lump sum payment pursuant to Section 10, subsection (7). 
4.  A beneficiary, may, in lieu of any benefit provided for in 1. or 2. above, elect to receive a refund of the deceased member's accumulated contributions. 
5.  If a surviving beneficiary commences receiving a benefit under subsection 1. or 2. above, but dies before all payments are made, the actuarial value of the remaining benefit will be paid to the surviving beneficiary's estate by December 31 of the calendar year of the beneficiary's death in a lump sum. 
6.  If there is no surviving beneficiary as of the member's death, and the estate is to receive the benefits, the actuarial equivalent of the member's entire interest must be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
7.  The Uniform Lifetime Table in Treasury Regulations Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 shall determine the payment period for the calendar year benefits commence, if necessary to satisfy the regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2509, § 7, 4-27-94; Ord. No. 2548, § 4, 11-8-95; Ord. No. 2621, §§ 1, 2, 3-8-00; Ord. No. 2914, § 1, 2-10-10) 
Sec. 8. - Disability. 
(1)  Disability benefits in line of duty. Any member who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, which disability was directly caused by the performance of his duty as a police officer, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to three percent (3%) of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service, but in any event the minimum amount paid to the member shall be sixty percent (60%) of the average final compensation of the member and, provided further, that no benefit payable to a member or former member pursuant to this subsection shall be less than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) per month. Upon the death of any member or former member drawing or entitled to a benefit under this subsection, his spouse and issue, if any, shall be entitled to the same benefits as are provided for the spouse and issue of a member under said section 7, subsection (1), and upon the assumption that the decedent was himself entitled to minimum benefit of at least one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) per month. Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the city for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within thirty (30) days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(2)  In-line-of-duty presumption: 
(a)  Presumption. Any condition or impairment of health of a member caused by hypertension or heart disease shall be presumed to have been suffered in line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence; provided, that such police officer shall have successfully passed a physical examination upon entering into such service, including cardiogram which examination failed to reveal any evidence of such condition; and provided further, that such presumption shall not apply to benefits payable or granted in a policy of life insurance or disability insurance. 
(b)  Additional presumption. The presumption provided for in this subparagraph (b) shall apply only to those conditions described in this subparagraph (b) that are diagnosed on or after January 1, 1996. 
1.  Definitions. As used in this subsection (2)(b), the following definitions apply: 
a.  Body fluids means blood and body fluids containing visible blood and other body fluids to which universal precautions for prevention of occupational transmission of blood-borne pathogens, as established by the Centers for Disease Control, apply. For purposes of potential transmission of meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis, the term "body fluids" includes respiratory, salivary, and sinus fluids, including droplets, sputum, and saliva, mucous, and other fluids through which infectious airborne organisms can be transmitted between persons. 
b.  Emergency rescue or public safety member means any member employed full-time by the city as a firefighter, paramedic, emergency medical technician, law enforcement officer, or correctional officer who, in the course of employment, runs a high risk of occupational exposure to hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis and who is not employed elsewhere in a similar capacity. However, the term "emergency rescue or public safety member" does not include any person employed by a public hospital licensed under chapter 395, Florida Statutes, or any person employed by a subsidiary thereof. 
c.  Hepatitis means hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis non-A, hepatitis non-B, hepatitis C, or any other strain of hepatitis generally recognized by the medical community. 
d.  High risk of occupational exposure means that risk that is incurred because a person subject to the provisions of this subsection, in performing the basic duties associated with his employment: 
i.  Provides emergency medical treatment in a nonhealth-care setting where there is a potential for transfer of body fluids between persons; 
ii.  At the site of an accident, fire, or other rescue or public safety operation, or in an emergency rescue or public safety vehicle, handles body fluids in or out of containers or works with or otherwise handles needles or other sharp instruments exposed to body fluids; 
iii.  Engages in the pursuit, apprehension, and arrest of law violators or suspected law violators and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids; or 
iv.  Is responsible for the custody, and physical restraint when necessary, of prisoners or inmates within a prison, jail, or other criminal detention facility, while on work detail outside the facility, or while being transported and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids. 
e.  Occupational exposure, in the case of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, means an exposure that occurs during the performance of job duties that may place a worker at risk of infection. 
2.  Presumption. Any emergency rescue or public safety member who suffers a condition or impairment of health that is caused by hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, that requires medical treatment, and that results in total or partial disability or death shall be presumed to have a disability suffered in the line of duty, unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence; however, in order to be entitled to the presumption, the member must, by written affidavit as provided in § 92.50, Florida Statutes, verify by written declaration that, to the best of his knowledge and belief: 
a.  In the case of medical condition caused by or derived from hepatitis, he has not: 
i.  Been exposed, through transfer of bodily fluids, to any person known to have sickness or medical conditions derived from hepatitis, outside the scope of his employment; 
ii.  Had a transfusion of blood or blood components, other than a transfusion arising out of an accident or injury happening in connection with his present employment, or received any blood products for the treatment of a coagulation disorder since last undergoing medical tests for hepatitis, which tests failed to indicate the presence of hepatitis; 
iii.  Engaged in unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior, as identified by the Centers for Disease Control or the Surgeon General of the United States or had sexual relations with a person known to him to have engaged in such unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior; or 
iv.  Used intravenous drugs not prescribed by a physician. 
b.  In the case of meningococcal meningitis, in the ten (10) days immediately preceding diagnosis he was not exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known to have meningococcal meningitis or known to be an asymptomatic carrier of the disease. 
c.  In the case of tuberculous, in the period of time since the member's last negative tuberculosis skin test, he has not been exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known by him to have tuberculosis. 
3.  Immunization. Whenever any standard, medically recognized vaccine or other form of immunization or prophylaxis exists for the prevention of a communicable disease for which a presumption is granted under this section, if medically indicated in the given circumstances pursuant to immunization policies established by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Public Health Service, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required by the city to undergo the immunization or prophylaxis unless the member' physician determines in writing that the immunization or other prophylaxis would pose a significant risk to the member's health. Absent such written declaration, failure or refusal by an emergency rescue or public safety member to undergo such immunization or prophylaxis disqualifies the member from the benefits of the presumption. 
4.  Record of exposures. The city shall maintain a record of any known or reasonably suspected exposure of an emergency rescue or public safety member in its employ to the disease described in this section and shall immediately notify the member of such exposure. An emergency rescue or public safety member shall file an incident or accident report with the city of each instance of known or suspected occupational exposure to hepatitis infection, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis. 
5.  Required medical tests; pre-employment physical. In order to be entitled to the presumption provided by this section: 
a.  An emergency rescue or public safety member must, prior to diagnosis, have undergone standard, medically acceptable test for evidence of the communicable disease for which the presumption is sought, or evidence of medical conditions derived therefrom, which tests fail to indicate the presence of infection, or, in the case of hepatitis infection, shall have banked serum for future testing, which future tests fail to reveal evidence of infection. This paragraph does not apply in the case of meningococcal meningitis. 
b.  On or after June 15, 1995, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required to undergo a pre-employment physical examination that tests for and fails to reveal any evidence of hepatitis or tuberculosis. 
(3)  Disability benefits not in line of duty. Any member with ten (10) years or more credited service who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, which disability is not directly caused by the performance of his duties as a police officer, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to three percent (3%) of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service and the fund shall pay, in addition thereto, the sum of twenty dollars ($20.00) per month for each of his issue in being during the time said member receives the benefit. Upon the death of said member, his spouse, if any, shall receive and be paid for the remainder of his or her natural life, or until remarriage, whichever occurs first, a sum equal to two-thirds ( 2/3) of the amount the deceased member was receiving, calculated only upon the length of the deceased member's credited service (exclusive of any additional payments of twenty dollars ($20.00) per month for each of the decedent's issue, which payments shall also continue). Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the city for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within thirty (30) days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(4)  Conditions disqualifying disability benefits. Each member who is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
(a)  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or narcotics. 
(b)  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections or while committing a crime. 
(c)  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the Armed Forces. 
(d)  Injury or disease sustained after his employment as a police officer with the City of Bradenton shall have terminated. 
(e)  Injury or disease sustained by the member while working for anyone other than the city and arising out of such employment. 
(5)  Physical examination requirement. A member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons who shall be selected by the board for that purpose. 
    The board shall not select the member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose except in an unusual case where the board determines that it would be reasonable and prudent to do so. 
    Any retiree receiving disability benefits under provisions of this ordinance may be periodically re-examined by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons who shall be selected by the board to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the board finds that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, the board shall recommend to the city that the retiree be returned to performance of duty as a police officer and the retiree so returned shall enjoy the same rights that such member had at the time he was placed upon pension. In the event the retiree so ordered to return shall refuse to comply with the order within thirty (30) days from the issuance thereof, or upon regaining certification where required and as herein provided, he shall forfeit the right to his pension. If recertification is required, then prior to returning to duty it shall be the responsibility of the retiree to begin, within thirty (30) days, to regain his certification as a police officer, if he has lost such certification during his disability period. In this event, he shall return to work immediately after such recertification. 
    The cost of the physical examination and/or re-examination of the member claiming or retiree receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by the board incident to the physical examination, such as, but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the fund. 
    If the retiree recovers from disability and re-enters the service of the city as a police officer, his service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he re-entered the service of the city will not be considered as credited service for the purposes of the system. 
    The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability claims. 
(6)  Disability payments. The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled in the event of the member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be: 
(a)  If the retiree recovers from the disability, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery; or 
(b)  If the retiree dies without recovering from disability, the payment due next preceding his death. 
Provided, however, the disability retiree may select, at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in section 10, subsection (1)(a), (1)(b) or (1)(c), which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit. 
(7)  Workers' compensation. When a member is receiving a disability pension and workers' compensation benefits pursuant to chapter 440, Florida Statutes, for the same disability, and the total monthly benefits received from both exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the member's average monthly wage, as defined in chapter 440, Florida Statutes, excluding overtime, the disability pension benefit shall be reduced so that the total monthly amount received by the member does not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of such wage. The amount of any lump-sum workers' compensation payment shall be converted to an equivalent monthly benefit payable for ten (10) years certain by dividing the lump-sum amount by 83.9692. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the disability pension benefit be reduced below the greater of forty-two percent (42%) of Average Final Compensation and two and three quarters percent (2.75%) of Average Final Compensation times years of Credited Service. 
(Ord. No. 2509, § 8, 4-27-94; ; Ord. No. 2548, § 5, 11-8-95; Ord. No. 2577, § 3, 3-25-98; Ord. No. 2621, §§ 1, 2, 3-8-00; Ord. No. 2914, § 1, 2-10-10; Ord. No. 3020, § 5, 2-28-18) 
Sec. 9. - Vesting. 
    If a member terminates his employment as a police officer, either voluntarily or by discharge, and is not eligible for any other benefits under this system, the member shall be entitled to the following: 
(1)  If the member has less than ten (10) years' credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a refund of his accumulated contributions or the member may leave it deposited with the fund. 
(2)  If the member has ten (10) or more years of credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a monthly retirement benefit, determined in the same manner as for normal or early retirement and based upon the member's credited service, average final compensation and the benefit accrual rate as of the date of termination, payable to him commencing at age forty-seven (47), provided he does not elect to withdraw his accumulated contributions and provided member survives to age forty-seven (47). In the event the member does not survive to age forty-seven (47) and does not withdraw his accumulated contributions, his designated beneficiary shall be entitled to a benefit as provided for a deceased member, vested or eligible for retirement under preretirement death for death off-duty, but based on his credited service and average final compensation on the date of his termination. 
(3)  Reserved. 
(Ord. No. 2509, § 5, 4-27-94; Ord. No. 2548, § 6, 11-8-95; Ord. No. 2621, §§ 1, 2, 3-8-00; Ord. No. 2914, § 1, 2-10-10) 
Sec. 10. - Optional forms of benefits. 
(1)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early retirement as specified herein, a member, upon written request to the board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one of the following options; 
(a)  A retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the retiree for his lifetime only. 
(b)  A retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the retiree for life but with one hundred twenty (120) payments guaranteed in any event. 
(c)  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the retiree during the lifetime of the retiree and following the death of the retiree, one hundred percent (100%), seventy-five percent (75%), sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3 %) or fifty percent (50%) of such monthly amount payable to a join pensioner other than his spouse for the joint pensioner's lifetime. Except where the retiree's joint pensioner is his spouse, the payments to the joint pensioner as a percentage of the payments to the retiree shall not exceed the applicable percentage provided for in the applicable table in the Treasury regulations. (See Q & A-2 of 1.401(a)(9)-6) 
(d)  If a member retires prior to the time at which Social Security benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as Social Security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the system, based upon the Social Security law in effect at the time of the member's retirement. 
(2)  The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner (subsection (1)(b) above) or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system in the event of member's death and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. A member may change his beneficiary at any time. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner and member's retirement income benefits have commenced, member may thereafter change his designated beneficiary at any time, but may only change his joint pensioner twice. Subject to the restriction in the previous sentence, a member may substitute a new joint pensioner for a deceased joint pensioner. In the absence of proof of good health of the joint pensioner being replaced, the actuary will assume that the joint pensioner has deceased for purposes of calculating the new payment. 
(3)  The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive benefits under the system shall thereupon cease. 
(4)  Upon change of a retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this section, the retirement income payable to the retiree shall be actuarially redetermined to take into account the age of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the retiree and to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the Retiree's then-current benefit at the time of the change. Any such retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board and on completion will be filed with the board. In the event that no designated beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the retiree subsequent to his retirement shall be paid as provided in section 11. 
(5)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(a)  If a member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under section 7. 
(b)  If the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the member's retirement under the system, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his retirement. 
(c)  If both the retiree and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the member or retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (1), the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with section 11. 
(d)  If a member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of section 6, subsection (1), and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the member in the amount or amounts computed as if the member had retired under the option on the date on which is death occurred. 
(e)  The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (701/2) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(6)  A retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
(7)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board, in its discretion, may elect to make a lump-sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the total commuted value of the monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to such member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(Ord. No. 2509, § 10, 4-27-94; Ord. No. 2548, § 7, 11-8-95; Ord. No. 2621, §§ 1, 2, 3-8-00; Ord. No. 2825, § 2, 4-12-06; Ord. No. 2914, § 1, 2-10-10; Ord. No. 3020, § 6, 2-28-18) 
Sec. 11. - Beneficiaries. 
(1)  Each member or retiree may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the board, designate a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the event of his death. Each designation may be revoked or changed by such member or retiree by signing and filing with the board a new designation-of-beneficiary form. Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the system shall cease. 
(2)  If a deceased member or retiree failed to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection (1), or if the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) named by a deceased member or retiree predeceases the member or retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the system with respect to such deceased member or retiree shall be paid to the estate of the member or retiree and the board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum. 
(3)  Any payment made to any person pursuant to this section shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to the deceased member and any other persons with rights under the system and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 2509, § 11, 4-27-94; Ord. No. 2621, §§ 1, 2, 3-8-00) 
Sec. 12. - Claims procedures. 
(1)  The board shall establish administrative claims procedures to be utilized in processing written requests ("claims"), on matters which affect the substantial rights of any person ("claimant"), including members, retirees, beneficiaries, or any person affected by a decision of the board. 
(2)  The board shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents for discovery prior to and at any proceedings provided for in the board's claims procedures. The claimant may request in writing the issuance of subpoenas by the board. A reasonable fee may be charged for the issuance of any subpoenas not to exceed the fees set forth in Florida Statutes. 
(Ord. No. 2509, § 12, 4-27-94; Ord. No. 2621, §§ 1, 2, 3-8-00) 
Sec. 13. - Reports to division of retirement. 
    Each year and no later than March fifteenth, the board shall file an annual report with the division of retirement containing the documents and information required by § 185.221, Florida Statutes. 
(Ord. No. 2509, § 13, 4-27-94; Ord. No. 2548, § 8, 11-8-95; Ord. No. 2621, §§ 1, 2, 3-8-00) 
Sec. 14. - Roster of retirees. 
    The secretary of the board shall keep a record of all persons enjoying a pension under the provisions of this ordinance in which it shall be noted the time when the pension is allowed and when the same shall cease to be paid. Additionally, the secretary shall keep a record of all members in such a manner as to show the name, address, date of employment and date of termination of employment. 
(Ord. No. 2509, § 14, 4-27-94; Ord. No. 2621, §§ 1, 2, 3-8-00) 
Sec. 15. - Maximum pension. 
(1)  Basic limitation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this system to the contrary, the member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the system shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of Code Section 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in Code Section 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) ($160,000), subject to the applicable adjustments in Code Section 415(b) and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this System. For purposes of this section, "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
For purposes of Code Section 415(b), the "annual benefit" means a benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) without regard to the benefit attributable to after-tax employee contributions (except pursuant to Code Section 415(n) and to rollover contributions (as defined in Code Section 415(b)(2)(A)). The "benefit attributable" shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations. 
(2)  Adjustments to Basic Limitation for Form of Benefit. If the benefit under the plan is other than the annual benefit described in subsection (1), then the benefit shall be adjusted so that it is the equivalent of the annual benefit, using factors prescribed in Treasury Regulations. If the form of the benefit without regard to any automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity or a qualified joint and survivor annuity, then the preceding sentence is applied by either reducing the Code Section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date or adjusting the form of benefit to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the additional benefits under the form of benefit as follows: 
(a)  For a benefit paid in a form to which section 417(e)(3) of the code does not apply (generally, a monthly benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greater of: 
1.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit to the member, or 
2.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the member, computed using a 5 percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Rulings 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code); or 
(b)  For a benefit paid in a form to which section 417(e)(3) of the code applies (generally, a lump sum benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greatest of: 
1.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in the plan for actuarial experience; 
2.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using a 5.5 percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code); or 
3.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable (computed using the applicable interest rate for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) (the 30-year Treasury rate (prior to January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the month prior to retirement, and on and after January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the first day of the plan year with a one-year stabilization period)) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code), divided by 1.05. 
(c)  The actuary may adjust the 415(b) limit at the annuity starting date in accordance with subsections (a) and (b) above. 
(3)  Benefits not taken into account. For purposes of this Section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
(a)  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
(b)  Any other benefit not required under §415(b)(2) of the Code and Regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of Code Section 415(b)(1); and 
(c)  That portion of any joint and survivor annuity that constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity. 
(4)  COLA Effect. Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b) (the "Limit"), the following will apply: 
(a)  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first limitation year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
(b)  thereafter, in any subsequent limitation year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under Code Section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
(c)  in no event shall a member's benefit payable under the system in any limitation year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code Section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
Unless otherwise specified in the system, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b), a Member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost of living increases as required by Section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable Treasury Regulations. 
(5)  Other Adjustments in Limitations. 
(a)  In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age sixty-two (62), the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of Code Section 415(b) of the Code, so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a one hundred sixty thousand dollar ($160,000) annual benefit beginning at age sixty-two (62). 
(b)  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least fifteen (15) years of credited service as a full-time employee of the fire or police department of the City, the adjustments provided for in (5)(a) above shall not apply. 
(c)  The reductions provided for in (5)(a) above shall not be applicable to disability benefits pursuant to Sec. 8, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to Sec. 7. 
(d)  In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age sixty-five (65), for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (a) herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age sixty-five (65). This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. 
(6)  Less than Ten (10) Years of Participation. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any member who has completed less than ten (10) years of participation shall be the amount determined under subsection (a) of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of participation and the denominator of which is ten (10). The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below 10% of the limit determined without regard to this subsection. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to pre-retirement disability benefits paid pursuant to Sec. 8, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to Sec. 7. 
(7)  Participation in Other Defined Benefit Plans. The limit of this section with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in Code Section 414(j) maintained by the City shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all City defined benefit plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one plan. 
(8)  Ten Thousand Dollar ($10,000) Limit; Less Than Ten Years of Service. Notwithstanding anything in this sec. 15, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this subsection (8) of sec. 15 if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this system and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the City contributes, do not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for the applicable limitation year and for any prior limitation year and the City has not any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated; provided, however, that if the member has completed less than ten (10) years of credited service with the City, the limit under this subsection (8) of sec. 15 shall be a reduced limit equal to ten thousand dollars ($10,000) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten (10). 
(9)  Reduction of Benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(10)  Service Credit Purchase Limits. 
(a)  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a member makes one or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the system, as allowed in Sections 27 and 28, then the requirements of this section will be treated as met only if: 
1.  the requirements of Code Section 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of Code Section 415(b), or 
2.  the requirements of Code Section 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of Code Section 415(c). 
For purposes of applying subparagraph (10)(a)1., the System will not fail to meet the reduced limit under Code Section 415(b)(2)(C) solely by reason of this subparagraph, and for purposes of applying subparagraph (10)(a)2. the System will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under Section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code solely by reason of this subparagraph. 
(b)  For purposes of this subsection the term "permissive service credit" means service credit- 
1.  recognized by the system for purposes of calculating a member's benefit under the plan, 
2.  which such member has not received under the plan, and 
3.  which such member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the system, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the system, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding clause (10)(b)2., may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a member is receiving under the system. 
(11)  Contribution Limits. 
(a)  For purposes of applying the Code Section 415(c) limits which are incorporated by reference and for purposes of this subsection (11), only and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable will be compensation actually paid or made available during a limitation year, except as noted below and as permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the system, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of Code Section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under Code Sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052 and will be determined without regard to any rules under Code Section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code Section 3401(a)(2). 
1.  However, for limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under Code Sections 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B),402(k), or 457(b). For limitation years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of Code Section 132(f)(4). 
2.  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the limitation year will also include compensation paid by the later of 21/2 months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
a.  the payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
b.  the payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
3.  Back pay, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this definition. 
(b)  No member of the system shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to social security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 1223, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
(c)  If the annual additions for any member for a limitation year exceed the limitation under section 415(c) of the code, the excess annual addition will be corrected as permitted under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (or similar IRS correction program). 
(d)  For limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, a member's compensation for purposes of this subsection (11) shall not exceed the annual limit under section 401(a)(17) of the code. 
(12)  Additional Limitation on Pension Benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
(a)  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of the system and who has not previously participated in such system, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
(b)  No member of the system shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to social security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 1223, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
(13)  Effect of Direct Rollover on 415(b) Limit. If the plan accepts a direct rollover of an employee's or former employee's benefit from a defined contribution plan qualified under Code Section 401(a) which is maintained by the employer, any annuity resulting from the rollover amount that is determined using a more favorable actuarial basis than required under Code Section 417(e) shall be included in the annual benefit for purposes of the limit under Code Section 415(b).

(c)  TEFRA Section 242(b)(2) elections. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section other than this (c), distributions may be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, in accordance with Section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) and the provisions of the plan that related to Section 242(b)(2) of TEFRA. 
(2)  Time and manner of distribution.

The member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the member no later than the member's required beginning date which shall not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half (70 1/2) or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the City. 
(b)  Death of member before distributions begin. If the member dies before distributions begin, the member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than as follows: 
1.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age seventy and one-half (701/2), if later, as the surviving spouse. 
2.  If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's sole designated beneficiary, then, distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. 
3.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death, the member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
4.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection (2)(b), other than subsection (2)(b)1., will apply as if the surviving spouse were the member. 
For purposes of this subsection (2)(b), distributions are considered to begin on the member's required beginning date or, if subsection (2)(b)4. applies, the date of distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (2)(b)1. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required beginning date (or to the member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (2)(b)1.) the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(c)  Death after distributions begin. If the member dies after the required distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the member's interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution before the member's death. 
(d)  Form of distribution. Unless the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with this section. If the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury regulations. Any part of the member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in Section 414(k) of the Code will be distributed in manner satisfying the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(3)  Determination of amount to be distributed each year.

1.  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year. 
2.  The member's entire interest must be distributed pursuant to Section 6, Section 7, Section 9, or Section 10 (as applicable) and in any event over a period equal to or less than the member's life or the lives of the member and a designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the member or of the member and a designated beneficiary. the life expectancy of the member, the member's spouse, or the member's beneficiary may not be recalculated after the initial determination for purposes of determining benefits. 
(b)  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the member's required beginning date (or, if the member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under Section 7) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., monthly. All of the member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member's required beginning date. 
(c)  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues.

Sec. 23. - Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions; elimination of mandatory distributions. 
(1)  Rollover distribution. 
(a)  General. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993. Notwithstanding any provision of the system to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(b)  Definitions: 
1.  Eligible rollover distribution. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income.

This definition shall apply in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse. 
3.  Distributee. A distributee includes an employee or former employee. It also includes the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse. Effective January 1, 2007, it further includes a non-spouse beneficiary who is a designated beneficiary as defined by Code Section 401(a)(9)(E). However, a non-spouse beneficiary may rollover the distribution only to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving the distribution and the account or annuity will be treated as an "inherited" individual retirement account or annuity. 
4.  Direct rollover. A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(2)  Rollovers or transfers into the fund. On or after January 1, 2002, the system will accept, solely for the purpose of purchasing credited service as provided herein, permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans, member rollover cash contributions and/or direct cash rollovers of distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, as follows: 
(a)  Transfers and direct rollovers or member rollover contributions from other plans.

The system will also accept legally permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans. 
(b)  Member rollover contributions from IRAs. The system will accept a member rollover contribution of the portion of a distribution from an individual retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or 408(b) of the Code that is eligible to be rolled over. 
(3)  Elimination of mandatory distributions. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event this plan provides for a mandatory (involuntary) cash distribution from the plan not otherwise required by law, for an amount in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), such distribution shall be made from the plan only upon written request of the member and completion by the member of a written election on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount.

The city reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to settle or not settle the claim at any time and to appeal or to not appeal from any adverse judgment or ruling, and in either event will indemnify and hold harmless any members of the board of trustees from the judgment, execution or levy thereon. 
(b)  This section shall not be construed so as to relieve any insurance company or other entity liable to defend the claim or liable for payment of the judgment or claim from any liability, nor does this section waive any provision of law affording the city immunity from any suit in whole or part, or waive any other substantive or procedural rights the city may have. 
(c)  This section shall not apply nor shall the city be responsible in any manner to defend or pay for claims arising out of acts or omissions of members of the board of trustees which constitute felonies or gross malfeasance or gross misfeasance in office. 
(d)  The indemnification provided for in this section shall apply only in the event that the board of trustees maintains fiduciary liability insurance with coverage in an amount of at least one million dollars ($1,000,000.00). The fund shall pay the premium for such insurance except for the premium for the waiver of recourse rider which will be paid by the city.

b.  Upon the member's termination of participation in the DROP, pursuant to subsection (a), (1) or (2) above, all amounts provided for in subsection (c)(2), including monthly benefits and interest, shall cease to be transferred from the system to his DROP account. Any amounts remaining in his DROP account shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d). 
c.  A member who elects to terminate his participation in the DROP under subsection (b)(4) shall not be permitted to again become a participant in the DROP. 
(5)  Effect of DROP participation on the system. 
a.  A member's credited service and his accrued benefit under the system shall be determined on the date his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. For purposes of determining the accrued benefit, the member's salary for the purposes of calculating his average final compensation shall include an amount equal to any lump sum payments which would have been paid to the member and included as salary as defined herein, had the member retired under normal retirement and not elected DROP participation. Member contributions attributable to any lump sums used in the benefit calculation and not actually received by the member shall be deducted from the first payments to the member's DROP account. The member shall not accrue any additional credited service or any additional benefits under the system (except for any supplemental benefit payable to DROP participants or any additional benefits provided under any cost-of-living adjustment for retirees in the system) while he is a participant in the DROP. After a member commences participation, he shall not be permitted to again contribute to the system nor shall he be eligible for disability or pre-retirement death benefits, except as provided for in Sec. 29, Reemployment after retirement. 
b.  No amounts shall be paid to a member from the system while the member is a participant in the DROP. Unless otherwise specified in the system, if a member terminates his participation in the DROP other than by terminating his employment as a police officer, no amounts shall be paid to him from the system until he terminates his employment as a police officer. Unless otherwise specified in the system, amounts transferred from the system to the member's DROP account shall be paid directly to the member only on the termination of his employment as a police officer. 
(c)  Funding. 
(1)  Establishment of DROP account. A DROP account shall be established for each member participating in the DROP. A member's DROP account shall consist of amounts transferred to the DROP under subsection (c)(2), and interest on those amounts. 
(2)  Transfers from retirement system. 
a.  As of the first day of each month of a member's period of participation in the DROP, the monthly retirement benefit he would have received under the system had he terminated his employment as a police officer and elected to receive monthly benefit payments thereunder shall be transferred to his DROP account, except as otherwise provided for in subsection (b)(4)b. A member's period of participation in the DROP shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of subsections (b)(3) and (b)(4), but in no event shall it continue past the date he terminates his employment as a police officer. 
b.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b)(4)b., a member's DROP account under this subsection (c)(2) shall be credited with interest at an effective rate of six and one-half percent (61/2%) per annum compounded monthly determined on the last business day of the prior month's ending balance and credited to the member's DROP account as of such date (to be applicable to all current and future DROP participants). 
c.  A member's DROP account shall only be credited with interest and monthly benefits while the member is a participant in the DROP. A member's final DROP account value for distribution to the member upon termination of participation in the DROP shall be the value of the account at the end of the month immediately preceding termination of participation plus any monthly periodic additions made to the DROP account subsequent to the end of the previous month and prior to distribution. If a member fails to terminate employment after participating in the DROP for the permissible period of DROP participation, then beginning with the member's first month of employment following the last month of the permissible period of DROP participation, the member's DROP account will no longer be credited with interest, nor will monthly benefits be transferred to the DROP account. All such non-transferred amounts shall be forfeited and continue to be forfeited while the member is employed by the city police department and no cost-of-living adjustments shall be applied to the member's credit during such period of continued employment. A member employed by the city police department after the permissible period of DROP participation will still not be eligible for pre-retirement death and disability benefits, and will not accrue additional credited service, except as provided for in Sec. 29, Reemployment after retirement. 
(d)  Distribution of DROP accounts on termination of employment. 
(1)  Eligibility for benefits. A member shall receive the balance in his DROP account in accordance with the provisions of this subsection (d) upon his termination of employment as a police officer. Except as provided in subsection (d)(5), no amounts shall be paid to a member from the DROP prior to his termination of employment as a police officer. 
(2)  Form of distribution. 
a.  Unless the member elects otherwise, distribution of his DROP account shall be made in a cash lump sum, subject to the direct rollover provisions set forth in subsection (d)(6). Elections under this paragraph shall be in writing and shall be made in such time or manner as the board shall determine. 
b.  Notwithstanding the preceding, if a member dies before his benefit is paid, his DROP account shall be paid to his beneficiary in such optional form as his beneficiary may select. If no beneficiary designation is made, the DROP account shall be distributed to the member's estate. 
(3)  Date of payment of distribution. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (d), distribution of a member's DROP account shall be made as soon as administratively practicable following the member's termination of employment. Distribution of the amount in a member's DROP account will not be made unless the member completes a written request for distribution and a written election, on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or a rollover of the lump sum amount. 
(4)  Proof of death and right of beneficiary or other person. The board may require and rely upon such proof of death and such evidence of the right of any beneficiary or other person to receive the value of a deceased member's DROP account as the board may deem proper and its determination of the right of that beneficiary or other person to receive payment shall be conclusive. 
(5)  Distribution limitation. Notwithstanding any other provision of subsection (d), all distributions from the DROP shall conform to "minimum distribution of benefits" provisions as provided for herein. 
(6)  Direct rollover of certain distributions. This subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the DROP to the contrary, a distributee may elect to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover as otherwise provided under the system in section 23. 
(e)  Administration of DROP. 
(1)  Board administers the DROP. The general administration of the DROP, the responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the DROP and the responsibility of overseeing the investment of the DROP's assets shall be placed in the board. The members of the board may appoint from their number such subcommittees with such powers as they shall determine; may adopt such administrative procedures and regulations as they deem desirable for the conduct of their affairs; may authorize one or more of their number or any agent to execute or deliver any instrument or make any payment on their behalf; may retain counsel, employ agents and provide for such clerical, accounting, actuarial and consulting services as they may require in carrying out the provisions of the DROP; and may allocate among themselves or delegate to other persons all or such portion of their duties under the DROP, other than those granted to them as trustee under any trust agreement adopted for use in implementing the DROP, as they, in their sole discretion, shall decide. A trustee shall not vote on any question relating exclusively to himself. 
(2)  Individual accounts, records and reports. The board shall maintain records showing the operation and condition of the DROP, including records showing the individual balances in each member's DROP account, and the board shall keep in convenient form such data as may be necessary for the valuation of the assets and liabilities of the DROP. The board shall prepare and distribute to members participating in the DROP and other individuals or filed with the appropriate governmental agencies, as the case may be, all necessary descriptions, reports, information returns, and data required to be distributed or filed for the DROP pursuant to the Code, the applicable portions of the Act and any other applicable laws. 
(3)  Establishment of rules. Subject to the limitations of the DROP, the board from time to time shall establish rules for the administration of the DROP and the transaction of its business. The board shall have discretionary authority to construe and interpret the DROP (including but not limited to determination of an individual's eligibility for DROP participation, the right and amount of any benefit payable under the DROP and the date on which any individual ceases to be a participant in the DROP). The determination of the board as to the interpretation of the DROP or its determination of any disputed questions shall be conclusive and final to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
(4)  Limitation of liability. 
a.  The trustees shall not incur any liability individually or on behalf of any other individuals for any act or failure to act, made in good faith in relation to the DROP or the funds of the DROP. 
b.  Neither the board nor any trustee of the board shall be responsible for any reports furnished by any expert retained or employed by the board, but they shall be entitled to rely thereon as well as on certificates furnished by an accountant or an actuary, and on all opinions of counsel. The board shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in reliance upon such expert, accountant, actuary or counsel, and all actions taken or suffered in such reliance shall be conclusive upon any person with any interest in the DROP. 
(f)  General provisions. 
(1)  The DROP is not a separate retirement plan. Instead, it is a program under which a member who is eligible for normal retirement under the system may elect to accrue future retirement benefits in the manner provided in this section 26 for the remainder of his employment, rather than in the normal manner provided under the plan. Upon termination of employment, a member is entitled to a lump sum distribution of his or her DROP account balance or may elect a rollover. The DROP account distribution is in addition to the member's monthly benefit. 
(2)  Notional account. The DROP account established for such a member is a notional account used only for the purpose of calculation of the DROP distribution amount. It is not a separate account in the system. There is no change in the system's assets, and there is no distribution available to the member until the member's termination from the DROP. The member has no control over the investment of the DROP account. 
(3)  No employer discretion. The DROP benefit is determined pursuant to a specific formula which does not involve employer discretion. 
(4)  IRC limit. The DROP account distribution, along with other benefits payable from the system, is subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b). 
(5)  Amendment of DROP. The DROP may be amended by an ordinance of the city at any time and from time to time, and retroactively if deemed necessary or appropriate, to amend in whole or in part any or all of the provisions of the DROP. However, except as otherwise provided by law, no amendment shall make it possible for any part of the DROP's funds to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of persons entitled to benefits under the DROP. No amendment shall be made which has the effect of decreasing the balance of the DROP account of any member. 
(6)  Facility of payment. If a member or other person entitled to a benefit under the DROP is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident or is a minor, the board shall direct that any benefit due him shall be made only to a duly appointed legal representative. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of the liabilities of the DROP for that benefit. 
(7)  Information. Each member, beneficiary or other person entitled to a benefit, before any benefit shall be payable to him or on his account under the DROP, shall file with the board the information that it shall require to establish his rights and benefits under the DROP. 
(8)  Prevention of escheat. If the board cannot ascertain the whereabouts of any person to whom a payment is due under the DROP, the board may, no earlier than three (3) years from the date such payment is due, mail a notice of such due and owing payment to the last known address of such person, as shown on the records of the board or the city. If such person has not made written claim therefor within three (3) months of the date of the mailing, the board may, if it so elects and upon receiving advice from counsel to the system, direct that such payment and all remaining payments otherwise due such person be canceled on the records of the system. Upon such cancellation, the system shall have no further liability therefor except that, in the event such person or his beneficiary later notifies the board of his whereabouts and requests the payment or payments due to him under the DROP, the amount so applied shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of the DROP. 
(9)  Written elections, notification. 
a.  Any elections, notifications or designations made by a member pursuant to the provisions of the DROP shall be made in writing and filed with the board in a time and manner determined by the board under rules uniformly applicable to all employees similarly situated. The board reserves the right to change from time to time the manner for making notifications, elections or designations by members under the DROP if it determines after due deliberation that such action is justified in that it improves the administration of the DROP. In the event of a conflict between the provisions for making an election, notification or designation set forth in the DROP and such new administrative procedures, those new administrative procedures shall prevail. 
b.  Each member or Retiree who has a DROP account shall be responsible for furnishing the board with his current address and any subsequent changes in his address. Any notice required to be given to a member or Retiree hereunder shall be deemed given if directed to him at the last such address given to the board and mailed by registered or certified United States mail. If any check mailed by registered or certified United States mail to such address is returned, mailing of checks will be suspended until such time as the member or Retiree notifies the board of his address. 
(10)  Benefits not guaranteed. All benefits payable to a member from the DROP shall be paid only from the assets of the member's DROP account and neither the city nor the board shall have any duty or liability to furnish the DROP with any funds, securities or other assets except to the extent required by any applicable law. 
(11)  Construction. 
a.  The DROP shall be construed, regulated and administered under the laws of Florida, except where other applicable law controls. 
b.  The titles and headings of the subsections in this section 26 are for convenience only. In the case of ambiguity or inconsistency, the text rather than the titles or headings shall control. 
(12)  Forfeiture of retirement benefits. Nothing in this section shall be construed to remove DROP participants from the application of any forfeiture provisions applicable to the system. DROP participants shall be subject to forfeiture of all retirement benefits, including DROP benefits. 
(13)  Effect of DROP participation on employment. Participation in the DROP is not a guarantee of employment and DROP participants shall be subject to the same employment standards and policies that are applicable to employees who are not DROP participants.

Sec. 27. - Military service prior to employment. 
    The years that a police officer serves or has served on active duty in the military service of the Armed Forces of the United States, the United States Merchant Marine or the United States Coast Guard, voluntarily or involuntarily and honorably or under honorable conditions, prior to first and initial employment with the city police department shall be added to his years of credited service provided that: 
(1)  The member contributes to the fund an actuarially determined amount such that the crediting of service does not result in any cost to the fund plus payment of costs for all professional services rendered to the board in connection with the purchase of years of credited service. 
(2)  Multiple requests to purchase credited service pursuant to this section may be made at any time prior to retirement, but no purchase is permitted for a period of less than one (1) year. 
(3)  Payment by the member of the required amount shall be made within six (6) months of his request for credit, but not later than the retirement date, and shall be made in one (1) lump sum payment upon receipt of which credited service shall be given. 
(4)  The maximum credit under this section, when combined with credited service purchased for service other than with the City of Bradenton, pursuant to Section 28, Prior Police Service, shall be four (4) years and shall count for all purposes except vesting and eligibility for not-in-line of duty disability benefits. 
(Ord. No. 2644, § 2, 1-10-01; Ord. No. 2689, § 4, 9-25-02) 
Sec. 28. - Prior police service. 
    Unless otherwise prohibited by law, and except as provided for in section 1, the years that a member previously served as a police officer with the city during a period of previous employment and for which period accumulated contributions were withdrawn from the fund, or the years and fractional parts of years that a member served as a police officer for any other municipal, county or state law enforcement department in the State of Florida shall be added to his years of credited service provided that: 
(1)  The member contributes to the fund an actuarially determined amount so that the crediting of the purchased service does not result in any cost to the fund plus payment of costs for all professional services rendered to the board in connection with the purchase of years of credited service. 
(2)  Multiple requests to purchase credited service pursuant to this section may be made at any time prior to retirement, but no purchase is permitted for a period of less than one (1) year. 
(3)  Payment by the police officer of the required amount shall be made within six (6) months of his request for credit and shall be made in one (1) lump sum payment upon receipt of which credited service shall be given. 
(4)  The maximum credit under this section for service other than with the City of Bradenton when combined with credited service purchased pursuant to section 27, military service prior to employment, shall be four (4) years and shall count for all purposes, except vesting and eligibility for not-in-line of duty disability benefits. There shall be no maximum purchase of credit for prior service with the City of Bradenton and such credit shall count for all purposes, including vesting. 
(5)  In no event, however, may credited service be purchased pursuant to this section for prior service with any other municipal, county or state law enforcement department, if such prior service forms or will form the basis of retirement benefit or pension from another retirement system or plan as set forth in section 15, subsection (12)(b). 
(6)  For purposes of determining credit for prior service as a police officer as provided for in this section, in addition to service as a police officer in this state, credit may be purchased by the member in the same manner as provided above for federal, other state, county or municipal service if the prior service is recognized by the Criminal Justice Standards and Training Commission within the Department of Law Enforcement, as provided under Chapter 943, Florida Statutes, or the police officer provides proof to the board that such service is equivalent to the service required to meet the definition of a police officer under Section 1, above. 
(Ord. No. 2689, § 5, 9-25-02; Ord. No. 2914, § 1, 2-10-10; Ord. No. 3020, § 9, 2-28-18) 
Sec. 29. - Reemployment after retirement. 
(a)  Any retiree under this system, except for disability retirement as previously provided for, may be reemployed by any public or private employer, except the city, and may receive compensation from that employment without limiting or restricting in any way the retirement benefits payable under this system. Reemployment by the city shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this section. 
(b)  Any retiree who is retired under normal (or early) retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed as a police officer and, by virtue of that reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, shall upon being reemployed, discontinue receipt of benefits. Upon reemployment, the member shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional credited service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final retirement. Calculations of benefits upon retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation, and credited service (and early retirement reduction factor, if applicable) as of that date and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation (based only on the subsequent employment period and not including any period of DROP participation), and credited service (and early retirement reduction factor, if applicable) as of the date of subsequent retirement. Upon reemployment, the member contribution rate for the reemployed retiree shall be the same as the other members during the subsequent employment period. The amount of any death or disability benefit received during a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the retiree may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable only to the subsequent retirement benefit. 
(c)  Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system who is reemployed by the city in a position other than as a police officer, shall upon being reemployed, continue receipt of benefits for the period of any subsequent employment. Former DROP participants shall begin receipt of benefits under these circumstances. 
(d)  Any retiree who is retired under early retirement pursuant to this system and who subsequently becomes an employee of the city in any capacity, shall discontinue receipt of benefits from the system. If the reemployed person, by virtue of his reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, that person shall accrue a second benefit as provided for in subsection (2) above and benefit payments shall remain suspended during any such subsequent employment period. If the reemployed person is not eligible to participate in this system, that person's pension benefit payments shall be suspended until the earlier of termination of employment or such time as the reemployed retiree reaches the date that he would have been eligible for normal retirement under this system had he continued employment and not elected early retirement. "Normal retirement" as used in this subsection shall be the current normal retirement date provided for under this system. 
(e)  Reemployed terminated vested persons shall not be subject to the provisions of this section until such time as they begin to actually receive benefits. Upon receipt of benefits, terminated vested persons shall be treated as normal or early retirees for purposes of applying the provisions of this section and their status as an early or normal retiree shall be determined by the date they elect to begin to receive their benefit. 
(f)  DROP Participants. Members or retirees who are or were in the Deferred Retirement Option Plan shall, following termination of employment after DROP participation, have the options provided for in this section for reemployment. 
(Ord. No. 2914, § 1, 2-10-10) 
Sec. 30. - Supplemental benefit component for special benefits; Chapter 185 share accounts. 
    There is hereby established an additional plan component to provide special benefits in the form of a supplemental retirement, termination, death and disability benefits to be in addition to the benefits provided for in the previous Sections of this Plan, such benefit to be funded solely and entirely by F.S. ch. 185, premium tax monies for each plan year which are allocated to this supplemental component as provided for in F.S. § 185.35. Amounts allocated to this supplemental component ("Share Plan"), if any, shall be further allocated to the members and DROP participants as follows: 
(1)  Individual Member Share Accounts. The board shall create individual "member share accounts" for all actively employed plan members and DROP participants and maintain appropriate books and records showing the respective interest of each member or DROP participant hereunder. Each member or DROP participant shall have a member share account for his share of the F.S. ch. 185 tax revenues described above, forfeitures and income and expense adjustments relating thereto. The board shall maintain separate member share accounts, however, the maintenance of separate accounts is for accounting purposes only and a segregation of the assets of the trust fund to each account shall not be required or permitted. 
(2)  Share Account Funding. 
(a)  Individual member share accounts shall be established as of September 30, 2017 for all members and DROP participants who were actively employed as of October 1, 2016. Individual member share accounts shall be credited with an allocation as provided for in the following subsection (3) of any premium tax monies which have been allocated to the share plan for that plan year, beginning with the plan year ending September 30, 2017. 
(b)  Any forfeitures as provided in subsection (4), shall be used as part of future allocations to the individual member share accounts in accordance with the formula set forth in subsection (3)(a). 
(3)  Allocation of Monies to Share Accounts. 
(a)  Allocation of Chapter 185 Contributions. 
1.  Effective as of September 30, 2017, the amount of any premium tax monies allocated to the share plan shall be allocated to individual member share accounts as provided for in this subsection. Members retiring on or after October 1, 2016 and prior to September 30, 2017 shall receive an allocation. In addition, all premium tax monies allocated to the share plan in any subsequent plan year shall also be allocated as provided for in this subsection. Available premium tax monies shall be allocated to individual member share accounts at the end of each plan year on September 30 (a "valuation date"). 
2.  On each valuation date, each current actively employed member of the plan not participating in the DROP, each DROP participant and each retiree who retires or DROP participant who has terminated DROP participation in the plan year ending on the valuation date (including each disability retiree), or beneficiary of a deceased member (not including terminated vested persons) who is otherwise eligible for an allocation as of the valuation date shall receive a share allocation as follows: 
3.  The total funds subject to allocation on each valuation date shall be divided equally among those persons eligible for an allocation and allocated to the member share account of those eligible for an allocation. 
4.  Re-employed retirees shall be deemed new employees and shall receive an allocation based solely on the credited service in the reemployment period. 
(b)  Allocation of Investment Gains and Losses. On each valuation date, each individual member share account shall be adjusted to reflect the net earnings or losses resulting from investments during the year. The net earnings or losses allocated to the individual member share accounts shall be the same percentage which is earned or lost by the total plan investments, including realized and unrealized gains or losses, net of brokerage commissions, transaction costs and management fees. 
Net earnings or losses are determined as of the last business day of the fiscal year, which is the valuation date, and are debited or credited as of such date. 
For purposes of calculating net earnings or losses on a member's share account pursuant to this subsection, brokerage commissions, transaction costs, and management fees for the immediately preceding fiscal year shall be determined for each year by the investment consultant pursuant to contracts with fund managers as reported in the custodial statement. The investment consultant shall report these annual contractual fees to the board. The investment consultant shall also report the net investment return for each manager and the net investment return for the total plan assets. 
(c)  Allocation of Costs, Fees and Expenses. On each valuation date, each individual member share account shall be adjusted to allocate its pro rata share of the costs, fees and expenses of administration of the share plan. These fees shall be allocated to each individual member share account on a proportionate basis taking the costs, fees and expenses of administration of the share plan as a whole multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total assets in each individual member share account (after adding the annual investment gain or loss) and the denominator of which is the total assets of the fund as a whole as of the same date. 
(d)  No Right to Allocation. The fact of allocation or credit of an allocation to a member's share account by the board shall not vest in any member, any right, title, or interest in the assets of the trust or in the Chapter 185 tax revenues except at the time or times, to the extent, and subject to the terms and conditions provided in this Section. 
(e)  Members and DROP participants shall be provided annual statements setting forth their share account balance as of the end of the plan year. 
(4)  Forfeitures. Any member who has less than ten (10) years of service credit and who is not otherwise eligible for payment of benefits after termination of employment with the city as provided for in subsection (5) shall forfeit his individual member share account. Forfeited amounts shall be included and used as part of the Chapter 185 tax revenues for future allocations to individual member share accounts on each valuation date in accordance with the formula set forth in subsection (c)(1). 
(5)  Eligibility For Benefits. Any member (or his beneficiary) or DROP participant who terminates employment as a police officer with the City or who dies, upon application filed with the board, shall be entitled to be paid the value of his individual member share account, subject to the following criteria: 
(a)  Retirement Benefit. 
1.  A member shall be entitled to one hundred percent (100%) of the value of his share account upon normal or early retirement pursuant to Section 6, or if the member enters the DROP, upon termination of employment. 
2.  Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (6). 
(b)  Termination Benefit. 
1.  In the event that a member's employment as a police officer is terminated by reason other than retirement, death or disability, he shall be entitled to receive the value of his share account only if he is vested in accordance with Section 9. 
2.  Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (6). 
(c)  Disability Benefit. 
1.  In the event that a member is determined to be eligible for either an in-line of duty disability benefit pursuant to Section 8, subsection (1) or a not-in-line of duty disability benefit pursuant to Section 8, subsection (3), he shall be entitled to one hundred percent (100%) of the value of his share account. 
2.  Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (6). 
(d)  Death Benefit. 
1.  In the event that a member or DROP participant dies while actively employed as a police officer, one hundred percent (100%) of the value of his member share account shall be paid to his designated Beneficiary as provided in Section 7. 
2.  Such payment shall be made as provided in subsection (6). 
(6)  Payment of Benefits. If a member or DROP participant terminates employment for any reason or dies and he or his beneficiary is otherwise entitled to receive the balance in the member's share account, the member's share account shall be valued by the plan's actuary on the next valuation date as provided for in subsection (3) above, following termination of employment. Payment of the calculated share account balance shall be payable as soon as administratively practicable following the valuation date, but not later than one hundred fifty (150) days following the valuation date and shall be paid in one lump sum payment. No optional forms of payments shall be permitted. 
(7)  Benefits Not Guaranteed. All benefits payable under this Section 30 shall be paid only from the assets accounted for in individual member share accounts. Neither the City nor the board shall have any duty or liability to furnish any additional funds, securities or other assets to fund share account benefits. Neither the board nor any trustee shall be liable for the making, retention, or sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of the member share account balances, except due to his or its own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. All investments shall be made by the board subject to the restrictions otherwise applicable to fund investments. 
(8)  Notional account. The member share account is a notional account, used only for the purpose of calculation of the share distribution amount. It is not a separate account in the system. There is no change in the system's assets, and there is no distribution available to the member or DROP participant until the member's or DROP participant's termination from employment. The member or DROP participant has no control over the investment of the share account. 
(9)  No employer discretion. The share account benefit is determined pursuant to a specific formula which does not involve employer discretion. 
(10)  Maximum Additions. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, annual additions under this Section shall not exceed the limitations of Section 415(c) of the code pursuant to the provisions of Section 15, subsection (11). 
(11)  IRC limit. The share account distribution, along with other benefits payable from the system, is subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b).

(Code 1971, § 2-2) 
Sec. 2-237. - Competitive bid requirements. 
    Contracts for the purchase of supplies, materials, equipment and for public works in excess of $25,000.00 shall be made after competitive bidding except as provided elsewhere in this section. After such bidding is complete the city may contract with the lowest responsible bidder. Nothing contained in this section, however, shall be construed to require that the city must award a contract after advertisements for bids or receipt of responses; the city council shall have the right to reject all bids or award to a bidder other than lowest bidder. The city council may at its option allow deviation from specifications contained in advertisements for bids if it deems it to be in the best interest of the city. Bidding requirements are for the benefit of the city and not for the benefit of any third party or contracting party. No property rights or vested rights shall inure to any bidder until a contract is signed or purchase order made and a bid is deemed to be only an offer to provide such supplies, materials, equipment and public works under the terms as set forth in the invitation to bid and related documents. 
(1)  In determining the lowest responsible bidders, in addition to price the city may consider the following: 
a.  The ability, capacity and skill of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service required; 
b.  Whether the bidder can perform the contract or provide the service promptly, or within the time specified, without delay or interference; 
c.  The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience and efficiency of the bidder; 
d.  The quality of performance of previous contracts or services; 
e.  The previous and existing compliance by the bidder with laws and ordinances relating to the contract or services; 
f.  The sufficiency of the financial resources and ability of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the service; 
g.  The quality, availability and adaptability of the supplies or contractual services to the particular use required; 
h.  The ability of the bidder to provide future maintenance and service; 
i.  The number and scope of conditions attached to the bid; 
j.  The record of, type of, and frequency of litigation of the bidder. 
(2)  If the head of any department shall maintain that an emergency exists in regard to the purchase of any supplies, materials, equipment or public works, so that the delay incident to giving opportunity for competitive bidding would be detrimental to the interest of the city, then the head of such department making the request shall make a statement to the city council stating the conditions and circumstances and requesting that competitive bidding be waived. Upon determination by the city council that an emergency does exist, then the purchase or the contract may be made without such bidding. 
(3)  Supplies, materials, equipment or public work available only from a single source may be excepted from the bid requirements upon the filing by the department head of the department requesting the supplies, materials, equipment or public work in a statement of conditions and circumstances showing that the supplies, materials, equipment or public work is available only from a single source and provided the city council shall authorize the exception. 
(4)  If the city has the opportunity to purchase supplies, materials, equipment or public work which have been previously used, the city may dispense with any bid procedures or advertisement for bids and negotiate directly with the owners of such used supplies, materials or equipment. Any purchase of used supplies, materials, equipment or public works involving more than $10,000.00 must, however, first be approved by the city council. 
(5)  After the city has received all bids and selected the lowest responsible bidder, prior to or after entering into a contract and provided it does not choose to reject all bids, the city may for any reasons within its discretion, including, but not limited to, budgetary reasons, technological reasons, time constraints and any other reasons for the benefit of the city, have the right to negotiate any changes in the specifications and contract terms with such bidder without having to rebid the purchase or contract. 
(6)  The city may waive any nonsubstantial deviation from any bid specifications in the responses to the advertisement for bids or request for proposals. 
(7)  Procurement for professional services shall be governed by applicable state law including that known as the Consultants Competitive Negotiations Act, as amended, and set forth in F.S. § 287.055 and such other procedures as the city council may from time to time adopt. 
(8)  In the event of a tie bid, the city may reject all bids or award the contract to either bidder as the city in its sole discretion deems proper and under any procedures it may adopt, including, but limited to, rebidding by the tie bidders, negotiation with the tie bidders or by lot or coin toss. 
(9)  In lieu of issuing requests for bids of proposals, the city may utilize previous bidding procedures and bid lists for any other political subdivision of the State of Florida, the State of Florida itself, its agencies, counties, independent special districts, any municipality and any list of the United States Government and United States Federal Agencies. The utilization of such bid lists and procedures shall not require the city to contract with the lowest bidder but with the best bidder as per the provisions of its bidding requirements.

State Law reference- Code enforcement boards, F.S. § 162.05. 

Sec. 2-316. - Applicability. 
    The city hereby adopts an alternate and supplemental code enforcement system providing for the equitable, expeditious, effective and inexpensive enforcement of all of the codes and ordinances of the city, unless specifically exempted by provision subsequently set forth in said code or ordinance, through utilization of a city code enforcement board to be appointed and designated by the city council upon recommendation of the mayor with the authority and powers hereinafter set forth, including the authority to hold hearings, make findings of fact, render conclusions of law, issue orders and assess fines against violators of the city codes and ordinances. 
(Ord. No. 2538, § 1, 9-27-95) 
Sec. 2-317. - Composition; qualifications; organization. 
(a)  Appointment of members and alternates. The city council shall appoint, upon the recommendation of the mayor, a CEB consisting of seven (7) members to exercise the authority and powers set forth in this article. The city council may, upon the recommendation of the mayor, appoint up to two alternate members for the CEB to act and serve on the CEB in the absence of the respective CEB member. 
(b)  Residency requirement; basis of appointments. Members and alternates of the CEB shall be residents of the city. Appointments shall be made on the basis of experience or interest in the subject matter jurisdiction of the CEB and membership, whenever possible, shall include an architect, a businessman, an engineer, a general contractor, a subcontractor, a realtor and the seventh member, as well as the alternate members, representing the public at-large. 
(c)  Appointments; suspension of members; operating rules: 
(1)  Number and terms of initial appointments. The initial appointments to the CEB shall be as follows: 
a.  Two members appointed for a term of one year each; 
b.  Three members appointed for a term of two years each; 
c.  Two members appointed for a term of three years each; 
d.  Alternate members, if appointed, for a term of three years each. 
(2)  Terms following initial appointment; reappointment. After the initial appointment, appointment to the CEB shall be made for a term of three years. A member may be reappointed for succeeding terms by the city council, upon the recommendation of the mayor. 
(3)  Vacancies. An appointment to fill any vacancy on the CEB shall be for the remainder of the unexpired term of office. If any member of the CEB fails to attend two of three successive meetings without good cause and without receiving the prior approval of the chairman, the CEB shall declare that member's seat vacant, notify the city council of same and the city council, upon such information, shall promptly appoint a member, upon the recommendation of the mayor, to fill such vacancy. 
(4)  Suspension and removal. The members of the CEB shall serve in accordance with the provisions of this article. A member may be suspended and removed for cause by the city council, upon recommendation of the mayor, after first being informed of the factual basis for such cause and having been given an opportunity to respond. If the city has established, or hereinafter establishes, by ordinance, a procedure for the suspension and removal for cause of members of boards, that procedure shall apply to and control the suspension and removal for cause of members of the CEB. 
(5)  Internal procedures and operating rules. The CEB shall adopt such internal procedural and operating rules as it deems necessary but not in conflict with the provisions of this article. 
(d)  Officers; quorum; compensation. The members of the CEB shall elect from their number, a chairman and a vice-chairman who shall be voting members of the CEB. The presence of four or more members of the CEB, or alternatives if such have been appointed, shall constitute a quorum of the CEB. Members shall serve without compensation, but may be reimbursed for such travel, mileage and per them expenses as may be authorized by the city council or as are otherwise provided by law. 
(e)  Legal representation for CEB. The city attorney shall be legal counsel to the CEB and advise the CEB accordingly concerning its duties, powers, jurisdiction and authority. The city attorney may prepare proposed orders incorporating proposed findings of fact and proposed conclusions of law for submittal to the CEB to be considered and adopted as its final administrative order for cases heard by the CEB. 
(f)  Legal counsel to advise code inspector, provide representation before CEB. If the city appoints a code enforcement legal counsel, said counsel shall advise the code inspector and may represent the city and the code inspector by presenting such cases before the CEB as the code inspector shall determine necessary. The appointment and existence of a code enforcement legal counsel is discretionary and does not affect or eliminate the hereinafter set forth powers, authority and duties of the code inspector. 
(Ord. No. 2538, § 3, 9-27-95) 
Sec. 2-318. - Powers of code enforcement board. 
    The CEB, appointed pursuant to this article, shall have the power to: 
(1)  Adopt rules for the conduct of the hearings; 
(2)  Subpoena alleged violators, witnesses and evidence to the hearings and such subpoenas may be served by the police department of the city or by the sheriff, as may be necessary; 
(3)  Take all testimony under oath; and 
(4)  Issue orders having the force of law to command whatever steps are necessary to bring a violation of the city's codes and ordinances into compliance.

Secs. 2-319-2-350. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 3. - ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS AND PROCEDURES 

Sec. 2-351. - Enforcement procedure. 
(a)  It shall be the duty of the code inspector to initiate enforcement proceedings of the various codes and ordinances of the city as established herein and in keeping with the provisions of this article. No member of the CEB shall have the power to initiate enforcement proceedings. 
(b)  Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) hereafter, if a violation of the city's codes or ordinances is found, the code inspector shall notify the violator and give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation. The determination of a "reasonable time" shall be in the sole discretion of the code inspector based on the type of violation, the facts and circumstances surrounding the violation, the length of time the violation has existed and the action reasonably necessary to correct the violation. Should the violation continue beyond the time specified for correction, the code inspector shall either notify the chairman or, in his absence, the vice-chairman of the CEB and request a hearing. If the violation is referred to the CEB, the CEB through its clerical staff shall schedule a hearing on the violation and written notice of such hearing shall be delivered to the violator at least ten days prior to the scheduled hearing as provided for by this article. If the violation is corrected and then reoccurs or if the violation is not corrected by the time specified for correction by the code inspector, the violation may be presented to the CEB even if the violation has been corrected prior to the hearing, and the notice shall so state. 
(c)  If a repeat violation is found, the code inspector shall notify the violator, but is not required to give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation. The code inspector, upon notifying the violator of a repeat violation, shall notify the CEB and request a hearing as provided for above. The violation may be presented to the CEB even if the repeat violation has been corrected prior to the hearing and the notice shall so state. 
(d)  If the code inspector has reason to believe a violation or the condition causing the violation present a serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the code inspector shall make a reasonable effort to notify the violator, but regardless of the success of such effort to notify the violator, the code inspector may immediately notify the CEB and request a hearing be held as soon as reasonably possible. 
(e)  If the owner of property which is subject to an enforcement proceeding before an enforcement board, special master, or court transfers ownership of such property between the time the initial pleading was served and the time of the hearing, such owner shall: 
(1)  Disclose, in writing, the existence and the nature of the proceeding to the prospective transferee. 
(2)  Deliver to the prospective transferee a copy of the pleadings, notices, and other materials relating to the code enforcement proceeding received by the transferor. 
(3)  Disclose, in writing, to the prospective transferee that the new owner will be responsible for compliance with the applicable code and with orders issued in the code enforcement proceeding. 
(4)  File a notice with the code enforcement official of the transfer of the property, with the identity and address of the new owner and copies of the disclosures made to the new owner, within five days after the date of transfer. 
    A failure to make the disclosures described in paragraphs (1-4) before the transfer creates a rebuttable presumption of fraud. If the property is transferred before the hearing, the proceeding shall not be dismissed, but the new owner shall be provided a reasonable period of time to correct the violation before the hearing is held. 
(Ord. No. 2538, § 4, 9-27-95; Ord. No. 2610, § 2, 10-27-99) 
Sec. 2-352. - Conduct of hearing. 
(a)  Upon the request of the code inspector, or at such other times as may be necessary to address administrative matters, the chairman, and in his absence the vice-chairman, of the CEB may call a hearing or a meeting of the CEB as circumstances dictate. A hearing or meeting of the CEB may also be called by written notice signed by at least three members of the CEB. Minutes shall be kept of all hearings, meetings and proceedings of the CEB. All hearings, meetings and proceedings of the CEB shall be open to the public, but under no circumstances is the public generally entitled to participate in the proceedings unless they have relevant and material evidence, testimony or matters to submit and then only with the permission of the chairman or vice-chairman. The city council shall provide for such clerical and administrative personnel as may be reasonably required and necessary by the CEB in the proper performance of their duties. 
(b)  Each case concerning a violation submitted to the CEB shall be presented on behalf of the city by either the code inspector, his designee and/or the code enforcement legal counsel, if appropriate. If the city prevails in prosecuting a case before the CEB, it shall be entitled to recover all costs incurred in the prosecution and such costs may be included in the lien authorized hereunder. 
(c)  The CEB shall proceed to hear the cases scheduled for hearing on the agenda for that day. All testimony shall be under oath and shall be recorded. Testimony shall be taken from the code inspector, the alleged violator and other witnesses who have relevant and material testimony or evidence to submit concerning the violation. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental due process shall be observed and shall govern the proceedings. The hearing or proceedings of the CEB are quasi-judicial in nature and the proper decorum, conduct and respect due such proceedings shall be rendered by all persons involved. 
(d)  At the conclusion of the hearing, the CEB shall render its initial findings and conclusions based on the evidence of record and, thereafter, within a reasonable time frame, shall issue its written "final administrative order" (FAO) containing findings of fact, conclusions of law and affording the proper relief consistent with the powers granted herein as it relates to the violation charged. The decision or findings of the CEB shall be by motion approved by a majority of those members, or alternates, as appropriate, present and voting, except that at least a total of four members, and, where applicable, alternates, must vote in order for the action to be official. The FAO of the CEB may include a notice that it must be complied with by a specified date and that a specific fine amount may be imposed and, under the conditions specified in § 162.09(1), Florida Statutes, the cost of repairs may be included along with the fine if the FAO is not complied with by said date. A certified copy of the FAO may be recorded in the public records of Manatee County and shall constitute notice to any subsequent purchasers, successors-in-interest or assigns if the violation concerns real property and the findings therein shall be binding upon the violator and, if the violation concerns real property, any subsequent purchasers, successors-in-interest or assigns. If a FAO is recorded in the public records pursuant to this provision and it is complied with by the date specified in said FAO, the CEB shall issue an "order acknowledging compliance" (OAC) with the FAO and that OAC shall be recorded in the public records. A hearing of the CEB is not required to issue an OAC, but may be executed by the chairman or vice-chairman as an administrative and ministerial duty. 
(Ord. No. 2538, § 5, 9-27-95) 
Sec. 2-353. - Administrative fines, costs of repairs and liens. 
(a)  An enforcement board, upon notification by the code inspector that an order of the enforcement board has not been complied with by the set time or upon finding that a repeat violation has been committed, may order the violator to pay a fine in an amount specified in this article for each day the violation continues past the date set by the enforcement board for compliance or, in the case of a repeat violation, for each day the repeat violation continues, beginning with the date the repeat violation is found to have occurred by the code inspector. In addition, if the violation is a violation described in section 2-351 (d), the enforcement board shall notify the local governing body, which may make all reasonable repairs which are required to bring the property into compliance and charge the violator with the reasonable cost of the repairs along with the fine imposed pursuant to this article. Making such repairs does not create a continuing obligation on the part of the local governing body to make further repairs or to maintain the property and does not create any liability against the local governing body for any damages to the property if such repairs were completed in good faith. If finding of a violation or a repeat violation has been made as provided in this article, a hearing shall not be necessary for issuance of the order imposing the fine. If, after due notice and hearing, a code enforcement board finds a violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may order the violator to pay a fine as specified in section 2-353 (b). 
(b)  A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall not exceed $250.00 per day for a first violation and shall not exceed $500.00 per day for a repeat violation, and, in addition, may include all costs of repairs pursuant to this section. However, if a code enforcement board finds the violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may impose a fine not to exceed $5,000.00 per violation. 
(1)  In determining the amount of the fine, if any, the enforcement board shall consider the following factors: 
a.  The gravity of the violation; 
b.  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; 
c.  Any previous violations committed by the violator; and 
d.  An enforcement board may, upon application of the violator, reduce a fine previously imposed. 
(c)  A certified copy of an order imposing a fine, or a fine plus repair costs, may be recorded in the public records and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order shall be enforceable in the same manner as a court judgement by the sheriffs of this state, including execution and levy against the personal property of the violator, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgement except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed pursuant to this part shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered in a suit to foreclose on a lien filed pursuant to this article, whichever occurs first. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this article runs in favor of the local governing body, and the local governing body may execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered pursuant to this article. After three months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the enforcement board may authorize the local governing body attorney to foreclose on the lien. No lien created pursuant to the provisions of this article may be foreclosed on real property which is a homestead under § 4, Art. X of the State Constitution. 
(Ord. No. 2538, § 7, 9-27-95; Ord. No. 2610, § 3, 10-27-99) 
Sec. 2-354. - Duration of lien. 
    No lien provided under this article shall continue for a period longer than 20 years after the certified copy of an OIF has been recorded, unless within that time an action to foreclose on the lien is commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction. In an action to foreclose on a lien, the prevailing party is entitled to recover all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee, that it incurs in the foreclosure. The city shall be entitled to collect all costs incurred in recording and satisfying a valid lien. The continuation of the lien effected by the commencement of the action shall not be good against creditors or subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, unless a notice of lis pendens is recorded. 
(Ord. No. 2538, § 8, 9-27-95) 
Sec. 2-355. - Appeals. 
    An aggrieved party may appeal a FAO of the CEB to the Circuit Court in and for Manatee County. Such an appeal shall not be a hearing de novo, but shall be limited to the appellate review of the record created before the CEB. An appeal shall be filed within 30 days of the execution of the FAO to be appealed. 
(Ord. No. 2538, § 9, 9-27-95) 
Sec. 2-356. - Notices. 
(a)  All notices required by this article shall be provided to the alleged violator by: 
(1)  Certified mail, return receipt requested, provided if such notice is sent under this paragraph to the owner of the property in question at the address listed in the tax collector's office for tax notices, and at any other address provided to the local government by such owner and is returned as unclaimed or refused, notice may be provided by posting as described in section 2-356(b) and by first class mail directed to the addresses furnished to the local government with a properly executed proof of mailing or affidavit confirming the first class mailing; 
(2)  Hand delivery by the sheriff or other law enforcement officer, code inspector, or other person designated by the local governing body; 
(3)  Leaving the notice at the violator's usual place of residence with any person residing therein who is above 15 years of age and informing such person of the contents of the notice; or 
(4)  In the case of commercial premises, leaving the notice with the manager or other person in charge. 
(b)  In addition to providing notice as set forth in the foregoing subsection (a), at the option of the code enforcement board, notice may also be served by publication or posting, as follows: 
(1)  In lieu of publication such notice may be posted for at least ten days prior to the hearing, or prior to the expiration of any deadline contained in the notice, in at least two locations, one of which shall be the property upon which the violation is alleged to exist, and the other of which shall be at City Hall. 
(2)  Proof of posting shall be by affidavit of the person posting the notice, which affidavit shall include a copy of the notice posted and the date and places of its posting. 
    Evidence that an attempt has been made to hand deliver or mail notice, together with proof of publication or posting as provided in this section, shall be sufficient to show that the notice requirements of this part have been met, without regard to whether or not the alleged violator actually received such notice. 
    Prior to issuing a notice to appear, a code enforcement officer shall provide written notice to the person that the person has committed a violation of a code or ordinance and shall establish a reasonable time period within which the person must correct the violation. Such time period shall be no fewer than five days and no more than 30 days. If, upon personal investigation, a code enforcement officer finds that the person has not corrected the violation within the prescribed time period, a code enforcement officer may issue a notice to appear to the person who has committed the violation. A code enforcement officer is not required to provide the person with a reasonable time period to correct the violation prior to issuing a notice to appear and may immediately issue a notice to appear if a repeat violation is found, or if the code enforcement officer has reason to believe that the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety, or welfare or that the violator is engaged in violations of an itinerant or transient nature, as defined by local code or ordinance within the jurisdiction, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible. 
(Ord. No. 2538, § 10, 9-27-95; Ord. No. 2610, § 4, 10-27-99) 
Sec. 2-357. - Enforcement provisions supplemental. 
    It is the intent of this article that it provide an additional or supplemental means of obtaining compliance with the city's codes and ordinances. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prohibit, prevent or limit the city from enforcing its codes and ordinances by any other lawful means available. 
(Ord. No. 2538, § 11, 9-27-95) 
Sec. 2-358. - Supplemental enforcement procedures for city codes and ordinances. 
(a)  Supplemental procedures established. There is hereby established pursuant to § 162.21, Florida Statutes, a collateral and supplemental procedure, process and remedy for the effective enforcement and compliance of all codes and ordinances, or any subsequent amendments thereto, of the city pursuant to the schedule hereinafter set forth, through the issuance of citations by enforcement officers of the city for violation of such codes and ordinances. 
(b)  Code enforcement officers. As used in this section, "code enforcement officer" means any designated employee or agent of the city whose duty it is to enforce codes and ordinances enacted by the city. The term is synonymous with the term "code inspector" utilized in the city's ordinance establishing a code enforcement board. 
(c)  Designation of certain city employees or agents as code enforcement officers. City code enforcement officers (CEO) shall be designated and appointed, in writing, by the mayor. The training and qualifications necessary for designation or appointment as a CEO shall be determined by and within the discretion of the mayor. However, those employees of the city who may be designated as, and are qualified as, CEO are hereby declared to include, but are not limited to, code inspectors, law enforcement officers, fire safety inspectors and building inspectors. Designation of an employee as a CEO, other than those employees who are certified law enforcement officers, does not provide the CEO with the power of arrest or subject the CEO to the provisions of §§ 943.085 through 943.255, Florida Statutes. 
(d)  Issuance of citations and procedures: 
(1)  A CEO is authorized to issue a citation to a person when, based upon personal investigation, the CEO has reasonable cause to believe that the person has committed a civil infraction in violation of a duly enacted code or ordinance of the city and that the county court will hear the charge. 
(2)  Prior to issuing a citation, a CEO shall provide notice to the violator that he has committed a violation of a code or ordinance of the city and shall establish a reasonable time period within which the violator must correct the violation. The designation of a reasonable time period for correction of the violation shall be within the sole discretion of the CEO, taking into consideration and utilizing as factors for such, the nature of the violation, the circumstances surrounding the violation, the efforts necessary to reasonably correct the violation, the length of time the violation has been in effect and whether the violation is a repeat offense. Nevertheless, such time period for correction shall not exceed 30 days. If upon personal investigation, a CEO finds that the violator has not corrected the violation within the time period provided in the notice, a CEO may issue a citation to the violator. A CEO does not have to provide a reasonable time period to correct the violation prior to issuing a citation and may immediately issue a citation if a repeat violation is found or if the CEO has reason to believe that the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety or welfare, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible. 
(3)  A citation issued by a CEO shall be in a form prescribed by the city and shall, as a minimum, contain: 
a.  The date and time of issuance; 
b.  The name and address of the person to whom the citation is issued; 
c.  The date and time the civil infraction was committed; 
d.  The facts constituting reasonable cause; 
e.  The number or section of the code or ordinance violated; 
f.  The name and authority of the CEO; 
g.  The procedure for the person to follow in order to pay the civil penalty or to contest the citation; 
h.  The applicable civil penalty, if the person elects to contest the citation (including an administrative fee to be paid to the clerk of the circuit court); 
i.  The applicable civil penalty, if the person elects not to contest the citation (including an administrative fee to be paid to the clerk of the circuit court); and 
j.  A conspicuous statement that if the person fails to pay the civil penalty or, alternatively, request a hearing, in writing, to contest the citation within 15 days of issuance, (on a form prescribed by the city and approved by the court), or fails to appear in court to contest the citation, he shall be deemed to have waived his right to contest the citation and that, in such case, a judgment may be entered against the person for an amount up to the maximum civil penalty. 
(4)  After issuing a citation to the violator, a CEO shall deposit the original citation and one copy of the citation with the county court by filing with the clerk of the circuit court. 
(e)  Schedule of violations and penalties. There is hereby established a "Schedule of Violations and Penalties" to be assessed for citations issued by CEO. A violation of a city code or ordinance listed below and enforced hereunder is a civil infraction. The maximum civil penalty for violation of a code or ordinance listed below shall not exceed $500.00, not including the administrative fee to be paid to the clerk of the circuit court, which shall be established and authorized for payment and receipt by administrative order. The maximum civil penalty shall not be assessed against a person who has committed a civil infraction identified in the schedule below and does not contest the citation. A person who has been issued a citation by a CEO may contest the issuance of that citation in county court in and for Manatee County. The clerk of the circuit court is hereby authorized to collect said civil penalties, including an administrative fee of $10.00, as tendered by the violator and remit the tendered sum, less the administration fee (which the clerk of the circuit court shall retain), to the city. The nonsubstantive reference provisions of the schedule relating to the inclusion, identification and referencing of city ordinances and codes may be added, amended and revised from time to time by resolution of the city council. 
SCHEDULE OF VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES 
    A violation of the below-identified and listed city ordinances and provisions of the Code of Ordinances (City Code) shall be a civil infraction and subject the violator to the following civil penalties as prescribed:

That portion of a facility designed and equipped as a dwelling unit which is actually being used as a permanent, temporary or transient private residence, including, but not limited to, houses, apartments, condominiums, hotel and motel rooms, dormitories, and boardinghouses, is not an establishment dealing in alcoholic beverages. This definition shall not be construed or interpreted to apply to any establishment except those where alcoholic beverages, as defined in this chapter, are sold, dispensed, consumed or possessed on the premises or permitted to be brought on the premises for consumption. 
(b)  Legislative finding. It is hereby found by the city council, acting in its legislative capacity for the purpose of regulating alcoholic beverage establishments, as authorized pursuant to the 21st Amendment, that, considering what has happened in other communities, the acts prohibited by this section encourage or create the potential for the conduct of prostitution, assault and sexual assault in and around establishments dealing in alcoholic beverages; that actual and simulated nudity and sexual conduct and the depiction thereof coupled with alcohol in public places begets and has the potential for begetting undesirable behavior; that sexual, lewd, lascivious and salacious conduct among patrons and employees within establishments dealing in alcoholic beverages results in violation of law and creates dangers to the health, safety, morals and welfare of the public and those who engage in such conduct; and it is the intent of this section to prohibit nudity, gross sexuality, and the simulation and depiction thereof in establishments dealing in alcoholic beverages. 
(c)  Nudity, sexual conduct prohibited. Within existing or newly created establishments dealing in alcoholic beverages: 
(1)  No person shall expose to public view such person's genitals, pubic area, vulva, anus, anal cleft or cleavage, or buttocks, or any simulation thereof. 
(2)  No female person shall expose to public view any portion of her breasts directly or laterally below the top of the areola or any simulation thereof. 
(3)  No person maintaining, owning or operating an establishment dealing in alcoholic beverages shall suffer or permit any person to expose to public view such person's genitals, pubic area, vulva, anus, anal cleft or cleavage, or any portion of the buttocks or simulation thereof. Within this subsection and section, the term "buttocks" shall mean the area at the rear of the body which lies between two imaginary lines running parallel to the ground when a person is standing, the first or top such line drawn at the top of the cleavage of the nates (i.e., the prominence formed by the muscles running from the back of the hip to the back of the leg) and the second or bottom line drawn at the lowest visible point of this cleavage or the lowest point of the curvature of the fleshy protuberance, whichever is lower, and between two imaginary lines on each side of the body, which lines are perpendicular to the ground and to the horizontal lines described above, and which perpendicular lines are drawn through the point at which each nate meets the outer side of each leg. This section would be violated, therefore, if any portion of this area is visible from any vantage point. 
(4)  No person maintaining, owning or operating an establishment dealing in alcoholic beverages shall suffer or permit any female person to expose to public view any portion of her breasts, directly or laterally, below the top of the areola or any simulation thereof.

This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit the showing of movies, tapes, or videocassettes that contain a movie industry rating of "R" or "PG-13."

B.  The Florida Legislature through the enactment of F.S. ch. 163, part II, section 3202(3), has sought to encourage Bradenton to enact impact fees;

D.  Each of the types of land development described in subsection (8), hereof, will create demand for the acquisition or expansion of parks and the construction of parks and recreation improvements. 
E.  The fees established by subsection (8) are derived from, are based upon, and do not exceed the costs of providing additional parks, and parks and recreation improvements necessitated by the new land developments for which the impact fees are levied. 
F.  The report entitled "The City of Bradenton, Florida, Impact Fee Methodology", dated February 13, 2002, sets forth a reasonable methodology and analysis for the determination of the impact of new development on the need for and costs for additional parks and parks and recreation improvements in the city.

(3)  Intent. This section is intended to assist in the implementation of the City of Bradenton Comprehensive Plan.

(e)  If the requested fair share mitigation involves a road segment on the strategic intermodal system (SIS), evidence of concurrence from the Florida Department of Transportation. 
(f)  Traffic study performed by a licensed traffic engineer demonstrating failure of road segment to achieve transportation concurrency. 
(2)  Within 20 days of receipt of the application, the planning and community development director shall review the application to determine if the application is complete. If it is determined that the application is not complete, the planning and community development director shall send a written statement to the developer delineating the deficiencies. If such deficiencies are not remedied by the developer within 30 days of receipt of the written notification, then the application shall be deemed abandoned. The planning and community development director, in his sole discretion, may grant an extension to cure such deficiencies, provided the developer has shown good cause for the extension and has taken reasonable steps to effect a cure. 
(3)  Once the Planning and Community Development Director determines the application is complete, he shall provide written notification of such to the developer and forward the application to the City Attorney who shall, within thirty (30) days, draft a proportionate fair share agreement for consideration by the City Council at a meeting no later than sixty (60) days from the date at which the developer received the notification that the application was complete. 
(4)  No proportionate fair share agreement shall be effective until approved by the City Council. 
(7)  Determination of proportionate fair share obligation. 
(A)  Proportionate fair share mitigation includes, without limitation, separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land and contribution of transportation facilities. 
(B)  The methodology used to calculate a developer's proportionate fair share obligation shall be as provided for pursuant to §163.3180(12), F.S. and as represented by the following formula: 
_____
Proportionate Share = [(Development Trips)/(SV Increase)] × Cost 
Where: 
Development Trips = Those trips from the development that are assigned to roadway segment; 
SV Increase = Service volume increase provided by the improvement to roadway segment 
Cost = Adjusted cost of the improvement. 
_____ 
(C)  For the purposes of determining proportionate fair share obligations, improvement costs shall be based upon the actual cost of the improvement as obtained from the CIP, the Manatee MOP Transportation Improvement Program, or the Florida Department of Transportation Work Program. Where such information is not available, the improvement cost shall be determined using one of the following methods: 
(1)  An analysis by the public works department of costs, adjusted by the Florida Department of Transportation Price Trends Index from the previous year, by cross section type that incorporates data from recent projects; or, 
(2)  The most recent issue of Florida Department of Transportation "Transportation Costs", as adjusted based upon the type of cross section (urban or rural); locally available data from recent projects on acquisition, drainage, and utility costs; and significant changes in the cost of materials due to unforeseeable events. 
(D)  If the city has accepted an improvement project proposed by the developer, then the value of the improvement shall be determined using one of the methods provided in this section. 
(E)  If the city has accepted right-of-way dedication for the proportionate fair share payment, credit for the dedication of the nonsite-related right-of-way shall be valued on the date of the dedication at 120 percent of the most recent assessed value by the Manatee County Property Appraiser or, at the mutual agreement of the city and the developer, by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the city and at no expense to the city. The developer shall supply a certificate of title or title search of the land to the city at no expense to the city. If the estimated value of the right-of-way dedication proposed by the developer is less than the city estimated total proportionate fair share obligation for that development, then the developer must also pay the difference. 
(8)  Transportation facilities impact fee credit. 
(A)  Proportionate fair share mitigation shall be applied as a credit against impact fees, if applicable. Credits will be given for that portion of the impact fees that would have been used to fund the improvements on which the proportionate fair share contribution is calculated. Additionally, if the proportionate fair share contribution is based on only a portion of the development's traffic, the credit will be limited to that portion of the impact fees on which the proportionate fair share contribution is based. 
(B)  At the time the proportionate fair share obligation is being determined, the city will also compute the transportation facilities impact fee obligation for the proposed development. If the developer's proportionate fair share obligation is less than the development's anticipated total transportation facilities impact fee, then the developer must pay the difference to the city. 
(9)  Proportionate fair share agreements. 
(A)  Should the developer fail to apply for a building permit within one year of the date of execution of the proportionate fair share agreement, then the agreement shall be considered null and void, and the developer shall be required to reapply in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter. 
(B)  Payment of the proportionate fair share contribution is due in full prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat and shall be nonrefundable. If the payment is submitted more than one year from the date of execution of the agreement, then the proportionate fair share cost shall be recalculated at the time of payment based on the best estimate of the construction cost of the required improvement at the time of payment, pursuant to [F.S.] § 183.36 and adjusted accordingly. 
(C)  Developer improvements authorized under this Ordinance involving dedications to the city must be completed upon final acceptance of the improvements and receipt of a warranty bond. The form of the warranty bond shall be approved by the city clerk and treasurer. 
(D)  Developer improvements authorized under this subchapter not involving dedications to city must be completed upon recording of a final plat or upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy, whichever event first occurs. 
(E)  Any requested change to a development project subsequent to a development order will be subject to additional proportionate fair share contributions to the extent the change would generate additional traffic. 
(F)  A developer may submit a letter to withdraw from the proportionate fair share agreement at any time prior to the execution of the agreement. The application fee to the city will be nonrefundable. 
(10)  Appropriation of fair share revenues. 
(A)  All proportionate fair share revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the CIP, or for use as otherwise established in the terms of the proportionate fair share agreement. 
(B)  In the event a scheduled transportation facility improvement is removed from the CIP, then the revenues collected for its construction shall be applied toward the construction of another improvement within that same corridor that would mitigate the impacts of development as determined by the city council.

(2)  The measurement shall be made at the real property line on which such sound is generated approximately five feet above ground, and the reading shall be the average sound level over a two-minute period of time. 
(3)  In the case of an elevated or directional sound source, compliance with the sound limits is to be maintained at any elevation at or beyond the real property line. 
(b)  Maximum permitted sound-pressure level in decibels of continuous sound. No person shall make, cause, allow, or permit the operation of any continuous source of sound in such a manner as to create, when measured at the real property line from which the sound emanates, a sound level that exceeds the following: 
(1)  Within any area zoned R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, T-3, or residential PDPs. Sixty-five dBA/dBC between the hours of 10:00 p.m. to 7 a.m.; all other times 75 dBA/dBC 
(2)  Within all other zoning districts. Seventy-five dBA/dBC between the hours of 7:00 a.m. until 10:30 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and 7:00 a.m. until midnight Friday, Saturday, and holidays; all other times 65 dBA/dBC

(9)  The applicable civil penalty if the person elects not to contest the citation. 
(10)  A conspicuous statement that if the person fails to pay the civil penalty within the time allowed, or fails to appear in court to contest the citation, the person shall be deemed to have waived his or her right to contest the citation and that, in such case, judgment may be entered against the person for an amount up to the maximum civil penalty. 
(e)  A violation of any section of this article shall be a written warning for a first offense, a $250.00 civil penalty for a second offense committed within 365 days of the written warning, and a $500.00 civil penalty for any subsequent offence. 
(f)  A citation issued under any section of this article shall be contested in county court. 
(g)  If the violator elects to contest the citation, he or she shall request a hearing through the procedure described on the citation and within the time frame specified on the citation.

A judgment may be entered against that person for the maximum civil penalty of $500.00 plus applicable fees and costs. 
(i)  In accordance with F.S. ch. 162, and as amended, any person who willfully refuses to sign and accept a citation issued by a code enforcement officer shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in F.S. §§ 775.082 or 775.083.

(Ord. No. 2583, § 1, 6-10-98; Ord. No. 2949, 5-22-13) 
Sec. 54-104. - Preliminary hearing; administrative penalty. 
(a)  Within five business days of receipt of the notice seizure the owner, co-owner(s) or lienholder may request a preliminary hearing, by delivering to the city, at the address set forth in the notice, a written request for a preliminary hearing. The written request must be received by the city in the allotted time or the right to a preliminary hearing shall be waived. The request must include a telephone number(s) where the owner, co-owner(s), lienholder, or the owner's designated agent can be telephonically notified of the date, time and location of the preliminary hearing, and the hours indicating when the owner, co-owner(s), leinholder or the owner's designated agent or designated agent will be available for such telephonic notification. 
(b)  Upon timely receipt of any owner's, co-owner(s), leinholder's, or the owner's designated agent written request for a preliminary hearing, the city shall schedule a hearing to be held within three business days following the date of receipt of the request, or as soon as practicable thereafter. The city shall make a good faith effort to notify the requesting owner, co-owner(s), leinholder, or the owner's designated agent telephonically of the date, time and location of the hearing, at the telephone number(s), during the hours indicated, as set forth on the request for preliminary hearing. However, at the election of the city, notice may be provided by any other means. 
(c)  If the requesting owner, co-owner(s), leinholder, or the owner's designated agent fails to attend the preliminary hearing, and the special master finds that the city has complied with the notice procedures, as set forth herein, then such failure shall constitute a waiver of the owner's, co-owner(s), leinholder's or the owner's designated agent right to a preliminary hearing. Any failure of the requesting owner, co-owner(s), lienholder, or the owner's designated agent to receive actual notice of the preliminary hearing shall not otherwise invalidate the administrative penalty proceedings as set forth herein. 
(d)  The preliminary hearing shall be held before a special master. The sole issue to be considered by the special master is whether the seizing police officer had probable cause under this section to seize and impound the vehicle. The formal rules of evidence shall not apply and hearsay evidence, including any relevant police report, is admissible. The burden of demonstrating probable cause is on the city. 
(Ord. No. 2583, § 1, 6-10-98; Ord. No. 2949, 5-22-13) 
Sec. 54-105. - Administrative fine/posting bond. 
    If a preliminary hearing is not requested, or if it was waived or if the special master finds that there was probable cause to seize and impound the vehicle, then the vehicle shall continue to be impounded pending final hearing or the payment of an administrative civil penalty of $500.00 together with all towing costs and storage. Alternatively, the owner, co-owner(s), lienholder, or the owner's designated agent may secure release of the vehicle by posting a cash bond (money order or certified check) in the amount of $500.00 together with all towing and storage costs, plus final hearing costs of $50.00, if such final hearing is requested. If no probable cause is found at the preliminary hearing, the vehicle shall be released to the owner, co-owner(s), lienholder, or the owner's designated agent as soon as practical without the imposition of any administrative fine, towing and storage costs or hearing costs. 
(Ord. No. 2583, § 1, 6-10-98; Ord. No. 2949, 5-22-13) 
Sec. 54-106. - Final hearing. 
(a)  The vehicle owner, co-owner(s), lienholder, or the owner's designated agent may request a final hearing by delivering to the city, within 15 days of receipt of the notice of seizure, a request for a final hearing together with a $50.00 final hearing fee. The request and final hearing fee must be delivered to the address provided in the notice of seizure and must include an address and phone number(s) where the owner, co-owner(s), lienholder, or the owner's designated agent can be notified of the date, time, and place of the final hearing. 
(b)  Upon timely receipt of a request for final hearing, the city shall schedule a hearing to be held within 30 days of the receipt of the request, or as soon as practicable thereafter. The city shall provide written notice to the requesting owner, co-owner(s), lienholder, or the owner's designated agent by hand delivery or by U.S. certified mail to the address on the request for final hearing. The notice shall state the date, time and location of the final hearing to be conducted by the special master pursuant to this subsection. 
(c)  If an owner, co-owner(s), lienholder, or the owner's designated agent fails to timely request a final hearing, or if the owner, co-owner(s), lienholder, or the owner's designated agent fails to attend the final hearing, and the special master finds, that the city has complied with the notice procedures, as set forth herein, then such failure shall constitute a waiver of the owner, co-owner(s), lienholder, or the owner's designated agent right to a final hearing and it shall be deemed admitted that the seized vehicle was used in violation of section 54-101. 
(d)  If not waived, the final hearing shall be held before the special master. The formal rules of evidence will not apply at the final hearing and hearsay evidence shall be admissible. The city shall have the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the vehicle was used as set forth in section 54-101. It shall be a defense that the vehicle was stolen at the time that it was seized and impounded or that the vehicle was under the control of a person other than an owner or co-owner and the owner or co-owner was not present at the time the vehicle became subject to seizure and impoundment. The owner or co-owner(s) of the vehicle shall have the burden to prove said defense by a preponderance of evidence. 
(e)  If the final hearing has been waived, or if, after the hearing, the special master finds by clear and convincing evidence that the vehicle was used as set forth in section 54-101, the special master shall enter an order authorizing the continued impoundment of the vehicle pending payment of a $500.00 administrative civil penalty, towing and storage costs, plus hearing cost of $50.00 or until otherwise released by the city. Any bond posted shall be used to satisfy the imposition of such penalty and costs. If the special master finds that the city did not meet its burden of proof, or that one of the exceptions set forth in subsection (d) apply, the vehicle shall be released to the vehicle owner, co-owner(s), lienholder, or the owner's designated agent as soon as practicable without the imposition of an administrative fine, towing, storage or hearing costs, and any cash bond posted shall be returned. 
(f)  If the final hearing is not provided as set forth in this article the vehicle shall be released to the owner, co-owner(s), lienholder, or the owner's designated agent as soon as practical without the impositions of penalties or fees. The owner, co-owner(s), lienholder, or the owner's designated agent shall not be entitled to release of the vehicle for delays in receiving notice of the final hearing absent a showing of resulting prejudice. 
(Ord. No. 2583, § 1, 6-10-98; Ord. No. 2949, 5-22-13) 
Sec. 54-107. - Costs. 
    A certified copy of an order of the special master imposing an administrative civil penalty and assessing towing, storage and hearing costs may be recorded in the public records of any county. Upon recording, the order shall constitute a lien against any real or personal property owned by the vehicle owner. Such lien shall be superior to all other liens, except a lien for taxes and shall bear interest at the rate of 12 percent per annum from the date of its filing. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of that state, including levy against the real or personal property, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. The city attorney or his designee is authorized to foreclose any lien established hereby in the same manner as is provided by law for the foreclosure of other municipal liens or alternatively, as provided by law for the foreclosure of mortgages. No lien created pursuant to this chapter may be foreclosed on real property which is homestead under Section 4, Article X of the State Constitution. In an action to enforce an order or to foreclose on a lien as provided in this section the city shall be entitled to recover all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee, that it incurs thereby.

    The city attorney, or his designee, is hereby authorized to enter into settlement agreements as may be appropriate to accomplish the objectives of this section. In addition, nothing herein shall prohibit the city from releasing a motor vehicle seized under the provisions of this section, if such release is determined to be in the best interests of the city. 
    Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the city from enforcing the provisions of this section against a vehicle initially seized pursuant to the state's contraband forfeiture act (but not both) if in the best interest of the city. 
(Ord. No. 2583, § 1, 6-10-98; Ord. No. 2949, 5-22-13) 
Sec. 54-109. - Appeals. 
    The owner, co-owner(s), lienholder, or the owner's designated agent of the vehicle which was seized and impounded may appeal a ruling or order of the special master by proceedings in the circuit court for the county. An appeal shall filed within 30 days of the execution of the order to be appealed. The nature of the appeal shall be from a final administrative order.

Sec. 62-1. - Obstruction of street right-of-way; peddler's license. 
(a)  Except when a permit has been issued as provided in this Code or otherwise authorized by the rules of the state department of transportation, it is unlawful to make any use of the right-of-way of any city street, including appendages thereto, in any manner that interferes with the safe and efficient movement of people and property from place to place on the city street. Failure to prohibit the use of right-of-way in this manner will endanger the health, safety, and general welfare of the public by causing distractions to motorists, unsafe pedestrian movement within travel lanes, sudden stoppage or slowdown of traffic, rapid lane changing and other dangerous traffic movement, increased vehicular accidents, and motorist injuries and fatalities. Such prohibited uses include, but are not limited to, the free distribution or sale, or display or solicitation for free distribution or sale, of any merchandise, goods, property or services; the solicitation for charitable purposes; the servicing or repairing of any vehicle, except the rendering of emergency service; the storage of vehicles being serviced or repaired on abutting property or elsewhere; and the display of advertising of any sort, except that any portion of a city street may be used for an art festival, parade, fair or other special event if a permit has been obtained from the city. The city may issue permits of limited duration for the temporary use of the right-of-way for any of these prohibited uses if it is determined that the use will not interfere with the safe and efficient movement of traffic and the use will cause no danger to the public. Before a street may be temporarily closed for a special event, the city must determine that the temporary closure of the street is necessary. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize such activities on the interstate highway system.

Any tree or limb of a tree which has become likely to fall on or across any public street or sidewalk shall be removed by the owner of the premises on which such tree grows or stands. The director of public works may trim any such tree or shrub or remove any such tree or branch thereof so that the obstruction to passage of persons using such public street or sidewalk shall be eliminated.

(Code 1971, § 21-31) 
Sec. 62-37. - Obstructions. 
(a)  A person cannot, either alone or along with others, stand, sit, lie, congregate or place objects in such a manner as to obstruct: (1) The safe and efficient movement of pedestrian traffic upon any sidewalk, walkway, or right-of-way upon which the public has a right to travel, or (2) any person's safe and efficient access to the entryway of any building, where such entryway abuts a sidewalk, walkway, or right-of-way upon which the public has a right to travel.

Secs. 62-38-62-55. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE III. - STREETS 

Sec. 62-56. - Rollerskating. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person to skate with rollerskates in the street. 
(Code 1971, § 21-4) 
Sec. 62-57. - Street names. 
(a)  Intent. A well-planned street-naming system aids motorists in identifying destinations, providing points of reference, and contributes to safe traffic flow and contributes to the interest of public health, safety, and welfare. Public inconvenience should also be considered since changing an existing name may be disruptive and costly to residents and business owners. 
(b)  General standards. The term "street" as used in this section may refer to any roadway used for automotive purposes. The following general standards are applicable for all street names within the jurisdiction of the city: 
(1)  Existing numbering pattern. Street names must follow the existing numbering pattern such as "1st Street," and "2nd Avenue," to maintain interconnectivity with the entire street grid. Private streets that are located within a gated community, business park, or planned development project that have two or less connections with existing streets outside of the community or project, may be designated with non-numbered names that are consistent with the theme of the development. 
(2)  Hierarchy of streets. While all streets are important, more careful consideration will be given to the naming or renaming of higher order streets, scenic highways, and specific highway corridors. In determining existing traffic systems, a hierarchy of streets has been established according to various criteria including traffic volume, ratio of traffic service to access service, number of lanes, and length of street segment. 
(3)  Duplication of names. Exact and near duplication of street names is not permitted. For example, the use of both Elm Street and Elm Avenue may be confusing and should, therefore, be avoided. It may be appropriate, however, for a minor subsidiary street to duplicate the primary name of a larger street with which it is associated, e.g., Island Court, a cul-de-sac, running off of Island Avenue. It is preferable not to use names which sound alike or which might be confused with one another, such as Beach Street and Beech Street. 
(4)  Prohibited names. It is desirable to use names which are simple and logical and which foster clarity and efficiency. Use of frivolous or complicated words or unconventional spellings in road names is prohibited. Names which might be reasonably perceived to be offensive are prohibited. The use of alphabetical letters such as "A Street," is generally prohibited. 
(5)  Names of local relevance. It is sometimes desirable to use names which have some association with the city and specifically with the immediate location of the street, such as reference to historical residents or physiographic features. Uses of names which may be misleading in terms of association are strongly discouraged. In order to preserve local history, care should be exercised in changing historical names. 
(6)  Naming streets after a person. Honoring an individual is a valid but secondary function of street naming. As such, it is desirable for there to be a direct association between the individual and the location of the named street. In determining whether a street should be named in honor of a particular person, consideration should be given to that person's relationship to the city, character, public image and contribution. More thoughtful and careful consideration should be rendered in the nomination of a person who is still living, younger in age, or still engaged (rather than retired) in his/her career. The size, significance and classification of the thoroughfare should not be out of proportion to the significance of the individual's contribution. However, it should not be construed that one's contribution is small if his/her name is affixed to a lower order street. 
a.  Names given to arterials and collectors should be reserved for individuals whose contribution has clearly been of great significance to the citizens within and outside of the city. A biographical profile of the individual for whom the street name is being requested may be required. 
b.  Naming of local streets after individuals is generally prohibited. 
(7)  Segment identification. A street's individuality should be easily definable, continuous, and unitary in its identity. Consideration will be favored toward the automobile driver, and how the driver would expect to see a street name end or continue. The minimum criteria for making this determination are as follows: 
a.  Termini. A street should have two distinct and appropriate termini. Appropriate termini may include: a street that dead ends or terminates at a "T" or "Y" intersection; an abrupt change in compass direction; a jurisdictional boundary; a natural boundary such as a river or dramatic change in topography; or a change in street type or size. 
b.  Street direction. A street name should not change abruptly before its terminus, take surprising turns, or extend oddly beyond a logical terminus. 
c.  Angled streets. Streets that continue through an intersection at or near a 180-degree angle should bear the same name. If the angle is significantly less, such as less than 135 degrees, it may be appropriate to use different names. At a three-way intersection, the two streets which form an angle closest to 180 degrees should bear the same name. A street running in a consistent compass direction should have one name throughout that distance. If it takes a sharp change in direction (excluding intersections) for a significant distance it may be appropriate to rename that portion of roadway. Where that section is clearly part of, and subsidiary to the larger roadway, it should bear the same name. 
d.  Multijurisdictional streets. It is preferable for most local and collector street names to continue across jurisdictional boundaries into adjacent cities or unincorporated areas. In selecting names for these streets, it should be considered which section of roadway is more defining in character and greater in length, and whether annexation is likely. 
(8)  Suffix designation. Thoroughfare suffixes (street, avenue, road, boulevard, parkway, highway, drive, lane, way, court, place, circle, etc.) should be appropriate to the type and size of the street. Suffix designations provide directional assistance in locating addresses by how roads look and travel. 
(c)  Procedures for naming or renaming streets. 
(1)  New streets. Naming of a newly created street shall require approval by the department of development services through the site plan review process, or other applicable review process, and shall not require city council approval. 
(2)  Renaming streets. A request for renaming an existing street shall require the submittal of a completed street renaming application package and the applicable fee to the department of development services as indicated in the procedures manual. All street renamings shall require consideration by the city council who may approve or deny the renaming. In rendering street renaming recommendations and decisions, the city council may consider unnecessary hardship to those affected property owners whose properties are directly addressed on the subject street. The city council reserves the right to change any street name, with proper public notice and hearing, when such change enhances public safety or welfare, including but not limited to duplication of, or similar-sounding street names; emergency or logistical problems of the street name; postal delivery problems; or for other reasons determined by the city council. 
(3)  Penalty. Violation of these guidelines or procedures may constitute a misdemeanor, punishable by law. 
(Ord. No. 2756, § 1, 6-9-04) 
STREET RENAMING APPLICATION: PROCEDURES 
Step 1: Preapplication Meeting. Schedule a meeting with the graphics coordinator, 941-708-6200 to discuss the proposed street renaming. The graphics coordinator will perform a cursory review of the request and answer any questions the applicant may have. See Table A for street suffix parameters. Step 2: Application and Fee. Obtain a "street renaming application," and do the following: 1. Complete the cover sheet and obtain the required information. 2. Complete the petition form and property owner signatures from at least 75% of the property owners directly abutting and addressed from the street petitioned for renaming. Only one property owner signature per address is permitted. 3. At the time of application submittal, pay a $350 street renaming fee and a $100 legal advertising fee. NOTE: If the renaming is approved by city council, the contact person listed on the cover sheet will be required to pay an additional fee to cover the costs of signage replacement. The street renaming shall not take effect until all fees have been paid. If after 20 working days of approval, all fees have not been paid, then the street renaming becomes null and void, and of no force or effect. Step 3: Development Services Review and Public Notice. 1. Once the application is determined to be complete, a staff evaluation and analysis report will be prepared, providing a recommendation to the city council. 2. At least 10 days prior, an advertisement will be placed in the Bradenton Herald indicating the date, time, and location of the public hearing by the City Council. Also, all affected property owners will be contacted by the city notifying them of the proposed street renaming. Step 4: City Council Public Hearing The contact person for the requested street renaming shall be required to attend the city council public hearing. Failure to attend may result in a denial of the application, and forfeiture of any fees paid. Step 5: Payment of Signage and Labor Fees 1. Upon approval by the city council of the street renaming, the graphics coordinator shall issue a "change of signage work order" to the public works department. The public works department will contact the contact person to submit payment of the actual signage replacement costs. Failure to submit payment within 30 days shall result in Denial of the street renaming request, and no signage will be changed. 2. NOTE: Signage costs due to errors in misspellings or misplacement of signage by the city will be paid for by the city. Signage replacement or changes as the result of neighborhood disputes, continual theft of signage due to novel signage text, or misspellings due to applicant/petition error shall be paid for by the contact person. Step 6: Sign Installation Once public works receives payment from the contact person, then the sign(s) will be replaced or added, as determined by the city.

Evidence of issuance of all required permits shall be provided by the applicant at the time of the meeting. 
h.  All required improvements shall be inspected by the department of public works and utilities at various stages of construction. The city and the private road administrator (as applicable) shall make a final inspection upon completion of construction and shall report the results of the final inspection to the city in writing. The applicant's engineer shall certify to the city before the final inspection and report thereon are made, that the required improvements were made in accordance with this article and all approved plans. 
(7)  Private road dedication. 
a.  Existing private roads may be considered for public ownership when requested by property owners abutting the private road. That request will come in the form of a private street dedication petition. The petition must be signed by property owners representing 100 percent of the total lineal front footage of the street. By signing the petition, the petitioners agree it is their intent to dedicate the street to public ownership. 
b.  Private streets will not be considered for public ownership unless: 
1.  The underground utilities met city standards when constructed, or until the utilities are brought up to current city standards; 
2.  The street surface features meet current city standards or are brought into an acceptable degree of compliance. Numerous factors will be considered through the petition process and the fact that the underground and surface standards are met does not guarantee that the street will be brought into public ownership. There are certain city standards that the city will not consider waiving or reducing as they relate to health and safety and ability to provide services. 
a)  Streets will not be considered for public ownership if they have less than ten feet of clear traffic pavement width (i.e., ten feet for one-way traffic, 20 feet for two-way traffic). 
b)  Grade of the street must meet current city street grade standards. 
c)  Deteriorated retaining walls and other private property features abutting the proposed public ownership are removed, repaired, or replaced by the property owners to ensure public safety. 
d)  The city will not consider the acceptance of an existing private street to public ownership unless it is demonstrated that the street dedication achieves at least one of the following objectives: 
i.  The street currently provides, or can provide with improvements: 
1)  Access to open space, public facilities/uses or other public amenities. 
2)  Mid-block pedestrian access. 
3)  An improvement to the surrounding pedestrian or vehicular circulation pattern. 
4)  An identified planning goal as noted in the adopted master plan for the neighborhood. 
ii.  Dedicating the private street to public ownership will encourage reinvestment in the community. 
iii.  Dedicating the private street will improve public health, safety, and general welfare. 
c.  The city will not pay the cost of underground (utilities, etc.) or surface (curb, gutter, sidewalks, concrete, etc.) improvements to bring the street up to city standards. The burden is on the private street property owners to fund necessary improvements. City funds will not be expended on streets created as part of a platted subdivision, on the policy basis that taxpayer funds should not be expended to address deficiencies in standards consciously chosen by the property developer. If directed by the city council, the city may make repairs to water or sewer lines in an emergency situation involving a substantial risk to health or safety and on the basis that the owner(s) will reimburse the city. 
d.  If a private street was created as part of a planned development, the city will not pay, or share the cost of repairing or improving the street. If the street was created through a planned development, an amendment to the planned development is required. There must be a compelling public interest proven for public ownership to be considered. The amendment process will be reviewed by the planning commission with a recommendation forwarded to the city council. 
e.  The city has no affirmative duty to inform residents if their street or utility is private. However, as courtesy, when a customer signs up for water service, the city will make a reasonable effort to inform the customer if their street or the water utility line is private. 
f.  The city will not take ownership of a street that does not allow public access. 
g.  The city will not take ownership of a street that is targeted for redevelopment as identified in a city master plan. 
h.  The city must be able to safely and efficiently provide services (fire protection, garbage collection, etc.) along the street in order to dedicate a private street to public ownership. 
i.  No specific rights or guarantees for use of the street, such as on-street parking are conveyed to private street owners if a private street becomes publicly owned. 
(8)  Variances. 
a.  Variances may only be granted by the city council upon the finding that at least one of the two following conditions have been met: 
1.  That a variance or exemption is required in order to comply with conflicting county or state laws, rules, or regulations. 
2.  That there are such special circumstances or conditions affecting said property that strict application of the provisions of this section would clearly be impractical or unreasonable. This may include topographic, vegetative, or drainage conditions. 
b.  In order to grant a variance, the city council shall also find: 
1.  That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property in the area in which said property is situated. 
2.  That such variance or exemption will not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of this section, the master plan, or the zoning ordinance. 
(9)  Administrative procedures. 
a.  Violations. Any person who violates any provision of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be subject to a fine not exceeding $500.00 or by imprisonment not exceeding 60 days, or both such fine and imprisonment. Any access that is used in violation of the terms of this article be and the same is hereby declared to be a nuisance per se, and such use may be abated, restrained, enjoined, and prohibited, upon the commencement of an appropriate action in the court of competent jurisdiction. 
b.  Fees. The city council shall establish by resolution a fee schedule to defray costs of inspection, plan review, administration, and enforcement of this section. 
c.  Severability. The provisions of this section are severable and any decision by any court of competent jurisdiction that any provision or clause hereof is invalid shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this section. 
d.  Compliance with other statutes, ordinance order, or regulation. Nothing in this section is intended to permit any practice which is a violation of any statute, ordinance, order or regulation, and no provision contained in this section is intended to impair or abrogate any civil remedy or process whether legal or equitable which might otherwise be available to any person.

Sec. 66-205. - Procedure for obtaining tax exemption. 
(a)  Application. An applicant (owner of record or authorized agent) seeking an ad valorem tax exemption for historic properties must file with the Administrative Official or designee a two-part Historic Preservation Property Tax Exemption Application with "Part 1: Pre-construction Application" (Part 1) completed. In addition, the applicant shall submit the following: 
(1)  A completed application for a certificate of appropriateness for the qualifying restoration, renovation, or rehabilitation. 
(2)  An application fee of not more than $500.00 to be determined by the administrative official based on the estimated cost of the work to be performed and the administrative costs to be incurred by the city in processing the application and monitoring compliance. 
(b)  Review by property appraisers office. Upon receipt of the pre-construction application, the administrative official or designee will transmit the application to the Manatee County Property Appraiser's office, which will review and provide an estimate of the probable increase in the appraisal of the property to the applicant and the city. The applicant can withdraw the application within 45 days of receiving the estimate and be reimbursed for the filing fee. 
(c)  Review by architectural review board. 
(1)  The Architectural Review Board of the City of Bradenton (ARB) shall review Part 1 applications for exemptions. The ARB shall determine whether the property is an eligible property and whether Part 1 proposed improvement is consistent with the Secretary of Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings and is therefore an eligible improvement. 
(2)  For improvements intended to protect or stabilize severely deteriorated historic properties or archaeological sites, the ARB shall apply the following additional standards: 
a.  Before applying protective measures that are generally of a temporary nature and imply future historic preservations work, an analysis of the actual or anticipated threats to the property shall be made. 
b.  Protective measures shall safeguard the physical condition or environment of a property or archaeological site from further deterioration or damage caused by weather or other natural, animal or human intrusions. 
c.  If any historic material or architectural features are removed, they shall be properly recorded and, if possible, stored for future study or reuse. 
d.  Stabilization shall reestablish the structural stability of a property through the reinforcement of load-bearing members or by arresting material deterioration leading to structural failure. Stabilization shall also reestablish weather resistant conditions for a property. 
e.  Stabilization shall be accomplished in such a manner that it detracts as little as possible from the property's appearance. When reinforcement is required to reestablish structural stability, such work shall be concealed wherever possible so as to not intrude upon or detract from the aesthetic and historical quality of the property, except where concealment would result in the alteration or destruction of historically significant material or spaces. 
(3)  For applications submitted under the provisions of section 66-204, the ARB shall also determine that the property meets the standards set forth in that section. 
(4)  The ARB shall notify the applicant and the city council in writing of the results of its review and shall make recommendations for correction of any planned work deemed to be inconsistent with the requirements for an eligible improvement. 
(5)  When an applicant is applying jointly for the ad valorem tax exemption and for federal historic preservation tax credits, the applicant will complete the National Park Service's (NPS) federal tax credit application Part 1 of the historic preservation property tax exemption application and submit both to the Administrative Official or the designee. The ARB shall defer action on the applications until the NPS has rendered a determination. In the event the NPS approves the federal tax credit application, the Part 1 application shall be amended to reflect any conditions issued by the NPS. The ARB shall then approve the tax exemption application and forward it to the city council to be to be handled as part of the normal approval process set forth below. A denial by the NPS shall cause the ARB to deny the ad valorem tax exemption. 
(d)  Request for review of completed work application. 
(1)  Upon completion of work specified in the "Part 1" application, the applicant shall submit a "Part 2: Final Application for Review of Completed Work" (Part 2). The ARB shall conduct an inspection of the subject property to determine whether or not the completed improvements are in compliance with the work described and conditions imposed in the approved Part 1 application. Appropriate documentation may include paid contractor's bills and canceled checks, as well as an inspection request by the applicant within two years following approval of the Part 1 application. 
(2)  On completion of review of the Part 2 application, the ARB shall recommend that the city council grant or deny the exemption. The recommendation, and reasons therefor, shall be provided in writing to the applicant and to the city council. The applicant shall be given at least ten days' notice of the date of the public hearing of the city council in the requested exemption. If a denial is recommended, and the applicant submits evaluations and plans which indicate that the applicant intends to undertake the work necessary to comply with the recommendations of the ARB, the denial of the applications may be continued by the Administrative Official or designee for a period of time not to exceed 60 days, while the applicant may resubmit documents indicating that the reasons for recommendation of denial of the application have been remedied and the administrative official or designee will re-inspect the work. 
(e)  Approval by city council. A majority vote of the city council shall be required to approve a Part 2 application and authorize the ad valorem tax exemption. The council, in over-turning or modifying the recommendation of the ARB shall utilize the same standards as used by the ARB in reaching its decision. If the exemption is granted, the city council shall adopt an ordinance that includes the following: 
(1)  The name of the owner and the address of the historic property for which the exemptions granted. 
(2)  The date on which the ten-year exemption will expire. 
(3)  A finding that the historic property meets the requirements of this article. 
(4)  A copy of the historic preservation exemption covenant, as provided in section 6, signed by the applicant and the mayor or designated successor. 
(f)  Notice of property appraiser. The property owner shall have the historic preservation exemption covenant recorded in the official records of Manatee County, and shall provide a certified copy of the recorded historic preservation exemption covenant to the administrative official or designee. Within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the certified copy, the administrative official designee shall transmit a copy of the approved "Part 2: Final Application", as well as the historic preservation exemption covenant to the Manatee County Property Appraiser with instructions that the property appraiser provide the ad valorem tax exemption to the applicant. Responsibility for paying the recording costs lie with the applicant. 
(g)  Effective date of exemption. The effective date of the ad valorem tax exemption shall be January 1 of the year following the year in which the application is approved by the city council and a historic preservation exemption covenant has been transmitted to the Manatee County Property Appraiser. 
(h)  An applicant previously granted a historic rehabilitation tax exemption by the historic preservation board may undertake additional improvement projects during the exemption period, or following its expiration, and reapply for an additional historic rehabilitation tax exemption for such work. An additional ten-year exemption shall apply only to the additional improvement. 
(Ord. No. 2584, § 5, 6-10-98) 
Sec. 66-206. - Required covenant. 
(a)  Effect of covenant. To qualify for an exemption, the property owner must enter into a covenant with the City of Bradenton for the term for which the exemption is granted. The form of the covenant shall be the "Historic Preservation Property Tax Exemption Covenant" (DOS Form No. HR3E111292). The covenant shall be binding on the current property owner, transferees, and their heirs, successors, or assigns. 
(b)  Revocation of exemption. Violation of the covenant or agreement will result in the property owner being subject to the payment of the differences between the total amount of taxes which would have been due in March in each of the previous years in which the covenant or agreement was in effect had the property not received the exemption and the total amount of taxes actually paid in those years, plus interest on the difference calculated as provided in F.S. § 212.12(3), as amended. In the event of a violation of the covenant, or damage to the historic property as detailed below, the ARB shall conduct a hearing, as provided the Land Use and Development Regulations for Special Exceptions, to allow the property owner to show cause why the exemption should not be revoked. Identification of the following conditions shall result in termination of the historic property tax exemption covenant, revocation of the exemption, and removal of a property from eligibility for the property tax exemption: 
(1)  The owner is in violation of the provisions of the historic preservation tax exemption covenant; or 
(2)  The property has been damaged by accidental or natural causes beyond the owner's control to the extent that the historic integrity of the features, materials, appearance, workmanship and environment or archaeological integrity which made the property eligible for listing in the National Register or designation under the provisions of the local preservation ordinance have been lost or so damaged that restoration is not feasible. Under this condition, the applicant is not required to pay back interest plus taxes. 
(c)  Appeal of revocation. The applicant can appeal a decision to revoke the exemption to the city council. The procedure for appealing the decision and the conduct of the hearing will be as specified in Land Use and Development Regulations for Special Exceptions.

In addition, this report will include a record of the average and peak daily flows being discharged during the reporting period. At the discretion of the director and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the director may decide to alter the month during which the compliance reports are to be submitted by a particular user. 
(b)  The director may impose quantum limitations on users which are practicing dilution to meet the applicable national categorical pretreatment standards and associated pretreatment requirements or in other cases where the imposition of quantum limitations are appropriate. In such cases, the compliance report required by subsection (a) of this section will indicate the quantity of pollutants regulated by such pretreatment standards to be discharged by the user. These reports will contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge and will include a record of the flow, nature and concentration, or quantity in pounds where requested by the director, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards and associated pretreatment requirements. The frequency of monitoring will be prescribed in the referenced pretreatment standards. All analysis will be performed in accordance with the procedures established by the administrator pursuant to section 304(g) of the Clean Water Act and contained in 40 CFR 136, and amendments thereto, or with any other test procedures approved by the administrator. Sampling will be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the administrator. It should be noted that where 40 CFR 136 does not include a sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis will be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication entitled Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants, dated April 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the administrator.

i.  The need for the dimensional variance was not created by the applicant's or previous owner's action, such as improper lot division, in violation of these LURs or previously effective land use regulations 
ii.  Strict application would prohibit the construction of a single-family residence on the lot of record, and 
iii.  The granting of the dimensional variance would not confer on the applicant any special privilege denied to other property owners in the same land use atlas district; and 
iv.  The application is for a dimensional variance for lot size, width and street frontage, and 
v.  The dimensional variance is the minimum variance that will allow reasonable use of the property. 
2.2.9.2  Application. An eligible applicant may file a variance application on forms or electronic media in a PDF format provided by the PCD director, along with the fee as set forth in appendix A, the information required for a zoning permit (subsection 2.2.1) and other information as required by the PCD director.

 Land use atlas 
 Flood insurance rate map 
 Historic district boundary map 
3.1.1  Residential districts. 
R-1 Single Family. This district is designed to permit low density single-family development. 
R-2 Two-Family. This district is designed to permit moderate density residential development consisting of both single-family and two-family dwellings. 
R-3 Multi-Family. This district is designed to permit high density multiple-family residential development. 
R-4 Mobile Home. This district is designed to provide for new mobile home developments and the redevelopment of existing mobile home parks. 
3.1.2  Mixed-use and non-residential districts. 
Urban Core district. This district is designed to combine very high intensity, downtown, pedestrian-oriented office and commercial development with the highest density, multiple-family residential development, and is intended to be used in substantially developed areas. 
UCBD district . This district is designed to combine high intensity, downtown, pedestrian-oriented office and commercial development with high density, multiple-family residential development, and is intended to be used in substantially developed areas. 
UV/Urban Village. This district is designed to facilitate continued use of already developed high density residential development and to provide for a compact, mixed-use, center of activity with neighborhood and community serving uses at a pedestrian scale and character. 
Urban Commercial Corridor district . This district is designed as a transitional zone between downtown and heavy commercial uses and is intended for a mix of pedestrian-oriented office/commercial uses. 
Suburban Commercial Corridor district. This district is designed to permit the development of commercial areas along major highways in predominantly developed areas and is intended to meet the needs of motorists and other consumers through the provision of automobile-oriented commercial development. 
P/Professional district. This district is designed to permit offices, medical facilities and related commercial uses and is intended for use primarily in developed areas. 
Industrial district. This district is designed to permit wholesale and storage establishments and industrial complexes in predominantly developed areas where compatible with surrounding land uses and is intended for use in areas with sites sufficiently large to accommodate industries, their ancillary facilities, parking and buffers. 
3.1.3  Special land use districts and overlays. The following land use districts and overlays are intended to provide additional standards conducive to their suggested themes, design standards, or geographical locations. Their boundaries are delineated on the land use atlas.

3.1.4.3 Where a land use atlas district boundary follows a stream or the shore of a body of water, that stream or shoreline is the boundary of the land use atlas district. 
3.1.4.4 Where a land use atlas district boundary does not clearly follow any of the features mentioned above, its exact location on the ground shall be determined by measurement according to map scale. 
3.1.4.5 In any case where the exact location of a land use atlas district boundary is not clear, the PCD director shall make a determination. 
3.1.5  Criteria for land use atlas district designations . Land within the city shall be assigned a land use atlas district designation from the list of standard land use atlas districts in section A. [sections 3.1.1 through 3.1.3] above.

3.3 - Special use permits. 
    Land uses requiring special use permits are those which have the potential of disturbing other land uses in the zoning district. Because they are not necessarily compatible with land uses in the zone in which they are allowed, they require discretionary review. Special uses are permitted only if in the specific instance the use will be compatible with surrounding uses or can be made compatible through limitations of their operation or enhancements of the site development design. The special use permit makes the stipulations of approval mandatory. The special use permit is valid for the property on which it is issued for as long as the conditions are met, unless the approval stipulates otherwise. Schedules 3.2.1.1 (residential), and 3.2.1.2 (non-residential) indicate what uses require special use permits in various zones. See section 2.2.4 for the application procedure. Special use permit applications shall be reviewed using the following: 
3.3.1  General standards. All special uses shall comply at minimum with the following standards. Additional requirements may be made by city council to ensure compatibility of uses. 
3.3.1.1 All special uses shall be subject to the general regulations of these LURs for single lot development, structures, lots, yards and vehicular use areas as well as the specific dimensional regulations for lots and structures for the zoning district in which the special use use is proposed. 
3.3.1.2 A landscaped separation strip of at least ten feet in width shall be provided along all property lines and along all streets serving the premises, except at approved access points. 
3.3.1.3 If the use is listed as a specific use in section 4.3, the standards of that section must be met. 
3.3.1.4 Docks requiring special use permit must comply with the requirements of section 3.3.3. 
3.3.2  Review criteria. All special uses shall comply with and be reviewed using the following criteria to determine whether to allow the use at the proposed location and to determine appropriate conditions to the use. 
3.3.2.1 The tract of land must be suitable for the type of use proposed by virtue of its location, topography, shape and the nature of surrounding development. 
3.3.2.2 Access points must be located so as to best suit the use and property. Wide spacing between access points and intersecting streets should be required when feasible. 
3.3.2.3 All buildings shall be located an adequate distance from property lines and streets. Setbacks in excess of those required for the specific zone may be required to lessen the effect of the use on neighboring properties. 
3.3.2.4 Permanent screening, such as walls, fences, hedges, and other barriers, may be required to protect surrounding properties from view of the premises or noises from the use. The minimum height and other parameters of such screening may be specified. 
3.3.2.5 The following shall be considered and cited as reasons for approval or denial of the application: 
a.  Adequacy of ingress and egress to property and proposed structures with particular regard for automobiles and pedestrian safety and convenience, traffic generation, flow and control and emergency access. 
b.  Location and design of off-street parking and loading areas in regard to the items in "a." above and the smoke, noise, glare, dust, vibrations, fumes, pollution and other effects of the use on adjoining properties. 
c.  Location and design of refuse and service areas in regard to availability, adequacy and effect upon surrounding properties. 
d.  Utilities, in regard to location, availability, adequacy and compatibility with surrounding properties. 
e.  Screening, buffering or separation of any nuisance or hazardous feature of the use. 
f.  Proposed signs and exterior lighting with reference to glare, traffic safety and compatibility and harmony with surrounding properties. 
g.  Effect upon the value of surrounding properties; the use shall not hinder the development of nearby vacant properties or adversely affect their economic value. 
h.  Adequacy of land and/or building which are to be used. 
i.  General compatibility or appropriateness with adjacent properties and other property in the district with special consideration given to the proposed hours of operation. 
j.  Environmental quality of the district in which the use is proposed and the effect the special use permit might have on such quality. 
k.  Consistency with the city's comprehensive plan. 
3.3.3  Docks requiring special use permit. 
3.3.3.1  General standards. Properties which are separated from a water body by a public right-of-way or public property must obtain a special use prior to installation of any dock, pier, or other appurtenance. Approval of any such dock, pier, or other appurtenance is subject to the following conditions: 
a.  The dock, pier or appurtenance shall not be attached to any seawall or other structure located in the public right-of-way. 
b.  Setbacks as specified by the Department of Environmental Protection must be complied with in the dock design, a minimum of ten feet. 
c.  The property owner will sign a grant of easement with the City of Bradenton for usage of the waterfront property and construction of the dock, pier or appurtenance. The easement specifies that if the City of Bradenton deems the removal of the dock necessary, it will be removed at the property owners expense. 
d.  The dock, pier or appurtenance will be compatible and appropriate with adjacent properties or other properties within the district. 
e.  The dock, pier, or appurtenance must be approved by the Department of Environmental Protection prior to issuance of a building permit. 
3.4. - Special district regulations. 
3.4.1  Planned development projects (PDP). The PDP standards in this section are geared to allowing developers maximum flexibility in designing higher quality, more innovative projects that might not otherwise be permitted through these LURs. Preservation of environmentally-sensitive lands, creation of green space, and innovative design is highly encouraged. Interactive community design is also encouraged. 
PDP review and approval is required for: 
 Any project or new construction in a PDP district, unless the new construction is considered a minor amendment to a previously approved PDP site plan; 
 Any project involving more than 200 linear feet of land below the two-foot contour line, pursuant to subsection 3.4.4. 
 A subdivision that does not meet the subdivision requirements of section 4.2. 
 To be eligible for PDP consideration, the proposed development should: 
 Be at least one acre in total area, unless the PCD director has determined that a smaller property could provide a beneficial contribution to the city or surrounding neighborhood. More than one lot of record may be proposed as part of a PDP, including non-contiguous lots of record within the same comprehensive plan neighborhood, subject to PCD approval. 
 Generally exceed the standards contained in the LURs, and not merely circumvent them. The applicant agrees that additional standards may be required as part of the approval process. Any PDP proposing a reduction of required standards must include findings provided by the applicant for justifying the reductions. 
 Be reviewed by the PCD director, public works and fire departments as part of a pre-application meeting, to discuss the concept of the proposed development and the procedural requirements of these LURs. The applicant must provide a conceptual site plan showing the subject property, its relationship to the surrounding properties, and the general development scheme. 
3.4.1.1  Land uses. In PDP land use districts, the land use category of the property as it appears on the future land use map in the comprehensive plan shall govern the uses which may be allowed within the proposed development, as follows: 
SCHEDULE 3.4.1.1 ALLOWED USES IN PDP DISTRICTS FLUM Designation Uses Allowed Residential Refer to R-3 district atlas category and subsection 3.4.1.3.a. Professional Refer to Professional district atlas designation. Commercial Refer to UV/UCC/SCC district atlas designation. Mixed Use Refer to UV/UC/UCBD district atlas designation. Industrial Refer to Industrial (I) District atlas designation.  
In all other land use districts, the land use atlas designation(s) of the property proposed for PDP approval shall govern the uses allowed within the development. Schedule 3.4.1.1 sets forth the uses which may be allowed in the various future land use map (FLUM) designations. 
3.4.1.2  General PDP standards . Certain design and service standards are required for all proposed PDPs regardless of the underlying primary use. While flexibility in these requirements may be granted, such flexibility should be mitigated with enhanced standards applied to other aspects of the proposed PDP. 
a.  Parking and vehicular access. While parking space, parking area design, and property access is dependent on the type of PDP proposed, the standards as set forth in subsections 4.1.4 and 3.4.1.3 of these LURs shall be generally applied to achieve the highest quality possible. Typically, parking area design should reflect logical and safe traffic flow, opportunities for shared parking and interconnectivity, pedestrian-oriented interaction, and an abundance of well-designed landscaping. Shopping cart areas should be considered an integral component of parking area use. 
Access involves ingress and egress design for the proposed development. Applicants must provide a thorough analysis of how the surrounding roadways will be affected by the proposed access design, including input from outside agencies, as applicable. In some cases, roadway improvements such as deceleration or acceleration lanes may be necessary to effect good access design. 
b.  Streets. The street standards set forth in subsection 4.1.3 must be met by all proposed PDPs. 
c.  Drainage and utilities. The drainage standards set forth in subsections 4.1.5 and 4.2.1.4 of these LURs must be met by all proposed PDPs. 
d.  Concurrency . All PDPs must meet the concurrency requirements set forth in subsection 4.1.1.5. of these LURs. Also, see subsections 2.2.10.4.a.iii. and 2.2.10.4.a.iv. and 3.4.1.5.f. for information concerning reservation of capacity for concurrency and for procedures for extending reservations of capacity. 
e.  Contributions to public facilities . Stipulations of approval of a preliminary PDP may include requirements to make improvements or contribute funding to improvements to public facilities such as roadways, sewer and water facilities, drainage facilities, schools, or parks and recreational facilities. Required improvements should be relative to the impacts caused by the proposed PDP. However, applicants may propose additional contributions as part of consideration for PDP approval which should be evaluated by the city in regard to the overall quality of the proposed development. 
f.  Protection of resources. PDPs must be designed to preserve natural, cultural and historic resources. Proposed development plans shall be reviewed to determine the adequacy of the plan in regard to preservation of such resources. PDPs which are partially in the Conservation district (see subsection 3.4.4) shall be consistent with the requirements of that district. In addition, proposed PDPs shall be designed so that all portions of the PDP lying in the Conservation district (below the two-foot contour line) shall be common open space maintained in perpetuity by the developer or homeowner's association. Additional stipulations may be imposed as found necessary by the approving body to protect coastal resources. 
g.  Recycling dumpster pad. In addition to trash dumpster(s), an eight-foot by 22-foot concrete pad for recyclable materials is required. The dumpster must be completely fenced or screened, and landscaped on all three sides. 
h.  Sidewalks. Sidewalks along roadways and those that provide logical pedestrian connections to other areas are required for all proposed PDPs, as determined by the PCD director. 
3.4.1.3  Additional PDP standards . This subsection sets forth required standards for primary use-oriented developments, as follows: 
SCHEDULE 3.4.1.3 SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR PDPs BY LAND USE Land Use Standard Reference Residential 
Group Care Facilities 
Day Care Facilities 
Boardinghouses Residential PDP standards (Subsection 3.4.1.3.a) Professional Offices 
Educational Facilities 
Religious Facilities Professional PDP Standards (Subsection 3.4.1.3.b) Commercial 
Industrial Commercial/Industrial PDP Standards (Subsection 3.4.1.3.b) Mixed Development Mixed Use PDP Standards (Subsection 3.4.1.3.c)  
a.  Residential PDP. 
i.  Density. The number of units per acre shall not exceed the maximum as allowed by the future land use map and related policies of the comprehensive plan. If the project is in a residential district (not a PDP zone) the density shall not exceed the density allowed in that land use atlas district. Acreage for density calculations shall not include areas within the Conservation district. Maximum density is not guaranteed for any proposed PDP, however, the quality of design, contribution to public facilities, open space and recreation, preservation of resources, and compatibility of the proposed development will be evaluated in order to recommend maximum density. 
ii.  Open space. Excluding roadways, parking areas, private yards, landscaped areas less than 250 square feet, and stormwater retention areas, open space shall make up a minimum of 25 percent of the site area. Open space may be in the form of recreation fields, courses, or fairways, pedestrian or bicycle paths or walkways, or landscaped common areas greater than 250 square feet each. In some cases, private yards designated as non-disturbed buffers or conservation easements may be eligible for open space calculations. In the Urban Core and Urban Central Business district, the open space requirement may be reduced or eliminated when the quality of the design justifies a reduction or elimination. 
iii.  Recreation area. Recreation area shall be provided at a ratio of one acre per 500 residents. In some cases, the PCD director may recommend that recreation area be provided at a ratio of one acre per 200 dwelling units, or more. In no case, shall the minimum recreation area be less than one-half acre, except in the UCBD or PDPs less than two acres in size. To be eligible for credit, a recreation area must include benches, trees, open or grassy areas or fields, pedestrian or bike paths, play or exercise facilities, courses, fairways, or other passive or active recreation facilities, or a combination of such facilities, which may be geared to the type of population served. Higher credit may be given to facilities usable by the general public, as determined by the PCD director. Pedestrian or bike paths designed to meet the recreation standard shall be in specifically designated corridors. No recreational credit will be given to required sidewalks along roadways except for specially-designed, incidental connection points. 
iv.  Parking . Two per dwelling unit plus one per ten units for visitor parking. On-street parking may be counted toward the required visitor parking only. In proposed developments of 50 units or more, parking spaces shall be provided at the recreation area in a ratio of one space per ten dwelling units. In some cases, the applicant may recommend more or less parking than required by these standards, however, such designs must be qualified and quantified by quality of design, empirical data, or emerging trends. 
v.  Building setbacks . The following setbacks for buildings are typically required, unless otherwise stipulated in the PDP approval for projects proposed outside the Urban Core, Urban Central Business district and Urban Village districts: 
Building setbacks for two-story buildings shall be: Thirty-five feet from any project property line which is also a street frontage, 50 feet from a major collector or arterial road as defined in subsection 4.1.3, and 15 feet from an interior private road. 
For buildings with more than two stories, building setbacks from any property line shall be increased by ten feet for each additional story. 
vi.  Buffers . A landscaped, well-designed perimeter buffer with a minimum or oscillating width of 25 feet from all property lines is required for all proposed residential PDPs, unless otherwise stipulated in the PDP approval. 
vii.  Accessory structures . Accessory structures may be approved as part of the proposed PDP based upon subsection 5.1.2 (Accessory structures, residential buildings), as found appropriate by the approving body. 
viii.  Neighborhood activity center. A neighborhood activity center consisting of light retail, restaurants, personal services, office, and other similar neighborhood types of activities may be proposed as a compact, defined area limited to one acre or five percent of the overall development. While no specific standards are suggested in order to allow innovation in design, a proposed neighborhood activity center will be evaluated for its physical design including types of uses proposed, pedestrian connectivity with the surrounding residential components, landscaping, and overall feasibility. 
b.  Professional, commercial, industrial PDP . See schedule 3.4.1.1 for restrictions on where professional, commercial, and industrial PDPs can be located. 
i.  Intensity . The maximum floor area ratio for professional, commercial, or industrial PDPs shall be 0.35, 0.50 and 1.0, respectively. 
ii.  Open space. Excluding roadways, parking areas, landscaped areas less than 250 square feet, and stormwater retention areas (unless designed as a landscape amenity), open space shall make up a minimum of 25 percent of the site area. 
iii.  Building setbacks . Principal buildings shall be set back 50 feet from street rights-of-way, and adjacent residential land use atlas districts. 
iv.  Permitted uses . The uses proposed in a professional, commercial, or industrial PDP shall be the same as those allowed in the Professional, UCC, SCC, or Industrial land use atlas districts, respectively, (see schedule 3.2.1.2), unless otherwise stipulated in the PDP approval. All uses proposed shall be consistent with the future land use map and the comprehensive plan. 
v.  Buffers . A landscaped, well-designed perimeter buffer with a minimum or oscillating width of 50 feet from all property lines is required for all proposed professional, commercial, or industrial PDPs, unless otherwise stipulated in the PDP approval. 
vi.  Accessory structures . Accessory structures may be approved with the proposed PDP based upon subsection 5.2.2 (Non-residential accessory uses), as found appropriate by the approving body. 
c.  Mixed/multiple use PDP . A mixed/multiple use PDP may be allowed in any area of the city provided that the proposed uses are consistent with the future land use map and the comprehensive plan. In the event that a mixed/multiple use PDP involves more than one land use category on the future land use map, the location of the components within the proposed PDP must be compatible with the future land use map. A mixed/multiple use PDP shall comply with all standards applicable to the PDP standards included in the single-use PDPs, above, however, it is expected that variations of the standards may be evaluated and recommended for approval. Proposed mixed/multiple use PDP should reflect the most innovative approaches toward quality development. 
3.4.1.4  Application and submittal . Proposed PDPs require a comprehensive application package including the required copies of a bound narrative which may include several of the studies and analyses components indicated in these LURs, and the master site plan and associated documentation and physical delineations.

(6)  The compatibility of the proposed development with existing and anticipated development; 
(7)  The relationship of the proposed development to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area; 
(8)  The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
(9)  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and debris and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and 
(10)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets and bridges. 
107.7 Conditions for issuance of variances. Variances shall be issued only upon: 
(1)  Submission by the applicant, of a showing of good and sufficient cause that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration, or topography of the site limit compliance with any provision of this ordinance or the required elevation standards; 
(2)  Determination by the appropriate local board that: 
(a)  Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship; 
(b)  The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances; and 
(c)  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
(3)  Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance, if granted, shall be recorded in the Office of the Clerk of the Court in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and 
(4)  If the request is for a variance to allow construction of the lowest floor of a new building, or substantial improvement of a building, below the required elevation, a copy in the record of a written notice from the Floodplain Administrator to the applicant for the variance, specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor, stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation (up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage), and stating that construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property.

4.1.1  Structures. See subsections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2, for permit requirements. Structures shall meet the requirements of subsections 3.2.2 and [chapter] 5.0, as applicable. Structures shall not be located in the future right-of-way of public streets, and required building setbacks shall be measured from the future right-of-way line. (See subsection 4.1.3 for right-of-way widths.) The PCD director may allow the setback to be measured from the existing right-of-way rather than from the future right-of-way in cases where the purchase of the future right-of-way area is not in the foreseeable future. Setback from the future right-of-way shall not be waived if widening of the street is included in the city or county five-year transportation improvement program (TIP), or is included in any improvement programs of the Florida Department of Transportation. In cases where existing right-of-way width is less than the requirement for the classification of the street (see subsection 4.1.3.2), reductions in setback shall be limited so that a minimum of 50 percent of the required right-of-way width is reserved. All structures shall maintain a 35-foot visibility triangle from an intersection of two streets or a street and alley. With the exception of residential accessory structures, metal buildings are prohibited in any zoning district other than the Industrial district. 
If a proposed structure is in a PDP (see subsection 3.4.1), structures will be permitted only as shown on the approved site plan or as allowed in subsection 3.4.1. If the structure is in a historic district, see subsections 3.4.2 and 2.2.13. Structures are further restricted in the coastal areas at or below two feet above mean sea level (see subsection 3.4.4). 
In storage facilities, no individual doors, except for main entry door(s), or painted doors on walls shall be allowed on the front elevation. No exterior walls of exposed cinder block shall be permitted unless block is treated for exterior finish. 
Outparcel treatment: The design of structures on outparcels shall be coordinated with the main structure on the parcel. At a minimum, similar colors and materials shall be used on exterior surfaces.

4.1.3.3  Pavement specifications . Street pavement shall be as required by the director of public works. Pavement shall be designed to carry the expected traffic loads and shall conform to current standard specifications for city streets. All street pavements shall be of a stable type. Loose aggregate will not be considered a completed pavement. 
4.1.3.4  Curbs and gutters . Curbs and gutters shall be provided on all streets unless otherwise approved by the director of public works. Vertical curbs shall not be less than six inches in height and Miami curbs shall not be less than three inches in height. All curbs shall conform to the design standards established by the director of public works. Backfill shall be higher than the curb and shall slope toward the curb in order to ensure that surface water drains into the storm drainage system. 
4.1.3.5  Sidewalks . Sidewalks shall be provided on at least one side of all local streets and minor collectors and both sides of arterials and major collectors. In the UC/UCBD and UV districts, sidewalks shall be provided on both sides of the street, regardless of the street classification. Sidewalks shall be concrete and shall be a minimum of four inches thick and five feet wide in residential areas, and eight feet wide in mixed-use and non-residential districts. Except in the UC/UCDB district there shall be at minimum a three-foot-wide strip of landscaped area (as defined in section 4.1.4.4.b.) between the sidewalk and curb, in which a tree (as listed herein ) shall be planted every 100 feet. Trees shall be species limited to the following: 
 Black olive; 
 Dwarf magnolia; 
 Palms (with the exception of cabbage palms); 
 Crape myrtle. 
The director of public works may, at his discretion, approve additional species or prohibit planting under certain circumstances. Trees planted in the right of way must meet the following criteria: 
a.  A root barrier shall be placed around select trees within or near the right-of-way. 
b.  No tree shall be placed any closer than ten feet (five feet with a root barrier) to any utility owned and operated by the City of Bradenton Public Works Department. 
c.  No trees shall be planted within utility easements. 
d.  No trees shall be planted under overhead utility lines. 
e.  Trees planted within medians shall not be paced as to hinder site [sight] visibility at intersections from any direction.

g.  Trees planted next to sidewalks shall be planted at a height as to not obstruct pedestrians use. 
h.  Trees shall not be planted in front of any signs. 
i.  All trees must be provided with an adequate watering system schedule until established. 
In PDPs where adequate provision for pedestrian circulation is provided, the requirements of this section may be modified by the approving body. Sidewalks shall be constructed as part of the street construction in subdivisions and PDPs unless phasing is specifically stipulated by city council. As part of the approval of a permit for a construction or alteration of structure or parking area, the PCD director may require the construction or reconstruction of sidewalks in order to fulfill the requirements of this section. 
4.1.3.6  Dead-end streets (cul-de-sacs) . Unless specifically approved by city council based upon a site plan, cul-de-sacs shall be no longer than 400 feet and shall have at the closed end a turnaround having a radius at the outside of pavement of at least 50 feet and at the outside of right-of-way at least 55 feet. 
4.1.3.7  Intersections. 
a.  Streets shall intersect as nearly as possible at right angles and no intersection shall be at an angle of less than 60 degrees. 
b.  Street curb intersections shall be rounded by radii of at least 20 feet. When the smallest angle of street intersection is less than 75 degrees, the director of public works may require curb radii of greater length. Wherever necessary to permit the construction of a curb having a desirable radius without reducing the sidewalk at a street corner to less than normal width, the property line at such street corner shall be rounded or otherwise set back sufficiently to permit such curb construction. 
c.  No lot or other parcel of land which abuts on and has access to either a collector or a local street and an arterial street shall have a service drive, curb cut, or other means of access directly to an arterial street within 150 feet of the right-of-way line of any such street which intersects the arterial street on which such lot or parcel is located. 
4.1.3.8  Curves in streets. 
a.  A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between reverse curves on arterial and collector streets. 
b.  Where there is a deflection angle of more than ten degrees in the alignment of a street, a curve with a radius adequate to ensure safe sight distance shall be made. The minimum radii of curves shall be: 
Street Type Minimum Curve Radius Arterial 300 feet Collector 300 feet Local 100 feet  
c.  Street jogs with center line offsets of less than 125 feet shall not be made. 
d.  Every change in grade shall be connected by a vertical curve constructed so as to afford a minimum sight distance of 200 feet, said sight distance being measured from a driver's eyes, which are assumed to be four and one-half feet above the pavement surface, to an object four inches high on the pavement. Profiles of all streets showing natural and finished grades, drawn to scale, may be required by the director of public works. 
4.1.3.9  Grades. 
a.  All streets shall be designed so as to provide for the discharge of surface water from the pavement and from the right-of-way by grading and drainage facilities. The minimum street grade required for adequate drainage shall be as approved by the director of public works. 
b.  The minimum grade of all streets shall be 0.3 percent unless specifically approved by the director of public works. 
c.  Streets shall be designed so as to make them flood free in order that properties served by such streets will not be isolated by floods. In flood-prone areas, the director of public works may require profiles and elevations of streets in order to determine the adequacy of design. Fill may be permitted by the director of public works provided that it does not adversely affect flood conditions of the surrounding properties. 
d.  All streets shall be graded to their full widths so that pavements and sidewalks can be constructed on the same level plane. Deviation from this standard due to special topographical conditions will be allowed only with the special approval of the director of public works. 
i.  Preparation of the subgrade. Before grading is started, the entire right-of-way area shall be first cleared of all tree stumps, roots, brush and other objectionable materials and of all trees not intended for preservation. The subgrade shall be properly shaped, rolled and uniformly compacted to conform to the accepted cross section and grades. 
ii.  Cuts . In cuts, all tree stumps, boulders, organic material, and other objectionable materials shall be removed to a depth of at least two feet below the grade surface. Rock, when encountered, shall be scarified to a depth of at least 12 inches below the graded surface. 
iii.  Fills . In fills, all tree stumps, boulders, organic material, soft clay, spongy material and other objectionable material shall be removed to a depth of at least two feet below the natural ground surface. This objectionable matter as well as similar matter from cuts shall be removed from the right-of-way area and disposed of in such a manner that it will not become incorporated in fills or hinder proper operation of the drainage system. 
4.1.3.10  Blocks . Block lengths shall not exceed 800 feet or be less than 400 feet, except as the director of public works considers necessary to secure the efficient use of land or desirable features of street layout. 
4.1.4  On-site parking and vehicular access. On-site parking shall be provided for each business, residence, institution or other land use in compliance with this subsection. See subsections 2.2.2 and 2.2.3 for permit requirements and procedures. The number of required on-site parking spaces for each type of land use and for handicapped persons is set forth in schedule 4.1.4.1. The PCD director may waive certain parking requirements in the PDP, UV, UC, and UCBD Land Use Atlas districts and planned redevelopment projects, and shall establish policies for equitably granting such waivers. Granting of a parking requirement waiver may require additional landscaping to be provided by the applicant pursuant to schedule 4.1.4.4. 
4.1.4.1  Design 
a.  The parking and vehicular use areas shall be improved subject to the approval of the director of public works. Asphalt and concrete are permitted, paver block, porous concrete or other pervious material (with the exception of shell) are encouraged. The paving requirement may be waived by the PCD director for a specific period of time or on a permanent basis for infrequently used parking areas such as those for recreational facilities or overflow parking areas. Within the Village of the Arts Overlay district, the PCD director may waive the paving requirements for up to five years. 
b.  Paved lots shall be striped or otherwise marked to designate individual spaces with the exception of driveways for one- and two-family dwellings. 
c.  Angle parking spaces shall measure a minimum of nine feet in width and 20 feet in length. Parallel parking spaces shall measure ten feet by 24 feet. Handicapped parking spaces shall measure 12 feet by 20 feet. The required width of the aisle between rows of parking spaces shall be dependent upon the angle of the parking spaces as follows: 
Angle of Parking Spaces Required Aisle Width 90 degrees 24 feet, two-way traffic flow 60 degrees 18 feet, one-way traffic flow 45 degrees 13 feet, one-way traffic flow 30 degrees 11 feet, one-way traffic flow Parallel 12 feet, one-way traffic flow  
Alternative parking lot layouts may be approved by the PCD director for special purpose parking lots, such as valet attended lots, storage lots for tractor trailers or lots for the storage of towed vehicles. This will allow administrative approval of specialty parking lots in cases where the standard layout is not appropriate. 
d.  Parking spaces shall have curbing, wheel stops or other effective means to prevent vehicles from encroaching into required landscaped areas. 
e.  Paved areas greater than 1,500 square feet in size shall comply with the drainage requirements of subsection 4.1.5 and shall require approval by the director of public works. Paved areas greater than 4,000 square feet shall require a drainage plan review and approval by the director of public works. And the Southwest Florida Water Management District approval or exemption. 
f.  Within large parking lots, the PCD director may require sidewalks and stop signs for the safety of pedestrians circulating in the lot.

The landscaping requirement may be waived by the PCD director for a specific period of time for phased development or on a permanent basis for infrequently used parking areas such as those for recreational facilities or overflow parking areas. Credit toward required landscaping materials may also be provided by the PCD director if existing vegetation is preserved as part of the proposed development. 
a.  Landscaping site plan. Details shall be shown on the site plan submitted for permit approval and shall include the common or scientific names of plant materials to be used in fulfillment of the requirements of this subsection. The landscaping site plan shall also show the permanent irrigation system. The PCD director may allow an alternative irrigation method upon good cause, such as the installation of drought tolerant plants, but in no case shall the PCD director allow less than the location of at least one existing or proposed water outlet within 150 feet of all plant materials. 
b.  Landscaping material specifications . Plant materials used in conformance with provisions of this subsection shall conform to the standards of Florida No. 1 or better as established by the Florida Department of Agriculture. Terms used in this section are defined as follows: 
i.  Landscaping materials: Any combination of materials such as grass, ground cover, shrubs, vines, hedges, trees or palms and non-living material commonly used in landscaping, such as rocks, pebbles, sand, walls or fences; excluding paving. 
ii.  Trees: Shall be species which, in the Manatee County area, have an average spread or crown of greater than 15 feet and have trunks which can be maintained in a clean condition over five feet of clear wood. Trees may be grouped to result in the required 15-foot spread, but palm trees shall not constitute more than 25 percent of the total tree units on the site. Tree types listed in subsection 2.2.3.1 as exempt from tree removal permits shall not be used for required trees under this subsection. Tree species whose roots are known to cause damage to sewer and water lines shall not be planted closer than 12 feet to such public utilities unless the tree root system is completely contained with a barrier or is otherwise approved by the PCD director and director of public works. The use of hybrid "high-rise" or "cathedral" oak trees, as well as tree diversity, is encouraged for commercial and multi-family buildings. 
iii.  Hedges: Where hedges are required, shrubs shall be placed 24 inches on center and maintained so as to form a continuous, unbroken, solid visual screen within a maximum of two years of planting. 
iv.  Vines: Shall be a minimum of 30 inches in height at the time of planting, and must be attached to a fence, screen or other support. 
v.  Grass areas: Shall be planted in such species as are commonly grown in permanent lawns in the Manatee County area. 
vi.  Ground covers used in lieu of grass: Shall be planted in such a manner as to present a finished appearance and reasonably complete coverage and shall be used with an acceptable mulch such as pine bark or recycled organic mulch when planted. 
c.  Placement of landscaping material . Landscaping materials shall not block visibility in a "clear" area between two and ten feet in height within 35 feet of the corner of two streets or within ten feet of the corner of a driveway and a street. Tree trunks may not be considered to block visibility if they are located so as not to create a traffic hazard and are trimmed so that foliage is not blocking view in the "unclear" area. Utility easements may be approved as part of the landscaped areas required under this section subject to the following: 
i.  No trees shall be planted within the easement. Trees with a mature height greater than 20 feet shall not be planted under power lines. 
ii.  All shrubs shall be maintained at six feet or less in height. 
iii.  No plants shall be placed in an easement if such plants will adversely affect or restrict the intended use of the easement. 
iv.  No alteration of drainage easements, such as the addition of berms or other grading, shall be made without the written approval of the director of public works. 
d.  Landscaping required. 
i.  Landscaping shall be provided in accordance with schedule 4.1.4.4. 
ii.  In the UV, UC and UCBD zoning district[s], the depth of the buffer may be reduced if it is determined by the PCD director that the property is inadequate in size to meet the full ten-foot requirement. For parking areas smaller than 6,000 square feet in area, the buffer may be reduced to a minimum of three feet, and in parking areas 6,000 square feet or larger, to a minimum of six feet. The PCD director may require landscaping elsewhere on the property to compensate for the loss of the required buffer. Interior landscaping requirements shall not be waived. In other districts, the PCD director may grant waivers of width of landscaped areas required under this section provided that the total required landscaping area is provided on site and is located in areas meeting the intent of this section to beautify off-street parking areas. The PCD director may also grant waivers for the grouping of trees or shrubs provided that the layout does not place trees as defined above in clusters which are concentrated so as to impair growth. Such waivers may be granted for the purpose of allowing some creativity in layout of landscaping materials and relief from the standard layout set forth in this section. Such waivers shall not be granted if they result in a reduction in landscaped area as required herein or a reduction in the types and numbers of plants required herein. The PCD director may reduce, but not eliminate the required width of a landscaped buffer in cases where the buffer abuts an existing buffer on adjacent property. 
iii.  Foundation landscaping shall be planted in the amount of 100 square feet of planting area per 1,500 square feet of building ground floor area. Planting areas shall be raised or ground level and be a minimum of eight feet wide and located on the side of the building visible from a public right-of-way. Seating courtyards, eating areas and plazas may be incorporated in the planting area. 
SCHEDULE 4.1.4.4 
LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS FOR PARKING AND VEHICULAR USE AREAS (except driveways for one and two-family dwellings) A ten-foot wide landscaped buffer strip shall be provided between each property line and any vehicular use areas.

b.  Commercial and industrial developments. All proposed projects for construction approval containing more than one acre of land shall conform to the same rules as set forth in the subsection 4.2.1.4. Drainage requirements. 
c.  Commercial and light industry developments. All proposed projects for construction approval containing less than one acre of land shall use the rational method of retention, based on the following formula: Gross site square footage × the coefficient of runoff value (0.05 to 0.75) × 0.08 (1-inch rainfall) = the amount of retention required in cubic feet. 
4.1.5.2  Drainage easements. 
a.  Drainage easements shall be maintained so that their function is not impaired through plant growth, debris, or permanent fences blocking ingress or egress to this area. 
b.  See subsection 4.2.1.5 for restrictions regarding planting and grading of easement areas. 
4.1.5.3  Off-site discharge. 
a.  Drainage discharge of sites shall not encroach into adjoining properties, unless documented private or public easements are established. 
b.  Discharge of stormwater runoff from sites adjacent to state- or county-maintained roads shall have written approval from that agency prior to the City of Bradenton final approval. 
c.  Any person performing construction activities shall implement proper erosion and sediment control practices at the construction site to minimize the amount of pollutants entering the city's municipal separate storm sewer system. Control measures shall be implemented prior to any grading or clearing with the exception of brush removal for surveying. 
4.2 - Subdivision of land. 
    This section contains the design standards and review criteria for subdivisions. The requirements for filing a subdivision plat and the procedures for approval are in subsection 2.2.10. 
4.2.1  Design standards. 
4.2.1.1  Lot dimensions . All lots within a subdivision shall conform to the dimensional requirements for the standard zoning district in which the subdivision lies (see schedules 3.2.2.1 and 3.2.2.2) or shall conform to the standards for planned development projects (see section 3.4.1). The density of residential subdivisions shall be governed by the zoning district in which the land lies (see schedule 3.2.2.1). In PDP zoning districts, the future land use map of the comprehensive plan and related policies shall govern density. Subdivisions using the dimensional requirements for a PDP shall obtain PDP approval (see section 3.4.1) prior to or simultaneously with subdivision approval. 
4.2.1.2  Streets. Streets shall conform to the standards in section 4.1.3. In addition, the following shall apply:

EXHIBIT 5.5.9 GRAPHIC ILLUSTRATIONS REGARDING SIGN TYPES AND MEASUREMENTS. Reserved for Future Standards  
5.5.10  Variances. Due to the diversity of the city, it is recognized that the LURs provided herein cannot address all situations pertaining to signs. The planning commission is therefore empowered to grant variances from the provisions of this section upon an application being filed with the PCD. A variance to this section may be granted as to the physical characteristics of a sign where the variance is not contrary to the public interest; and, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this section will result in unnecessary hardship; however, no variance shall be granted by the planning commission which has the effect of allowing a sign prohibited by subsection 5.5.5. Each variance application shall include a fee as adopted by resolution of the city council for administrative expenses incurred in the processing of the application, shall be in writing, and shall state with specificity the hardship and grounds upon which the petitioner bases the claim for a variance request. 
5.5.11  Permitting requirements. 
5.5.11.1  Building permit. When required by the Florida Building Code, a building permit shall be obtained to erect those signs or sign structures that are subject to it. The requirement of a building permit is separate from the requirement of a sign permit. 
5.5.11.2  Sign permit. Except for exempt signs, it shall be unlawful for any person to install, alter or cause to be installed or altered within the municipal limits of the city any sign otherwise allowed under this section and visible from a public right-of-way, whether permanent or temporary, without first having obtained a sign permit from the city. The sign permit shall be issued by the city only after determination has been made that the proposed sign fully complies with all conditions of this section. 
5.5.11.3  Fees. No permit shall be issued until the appropriate application has been filed with the department of planning and community development and the applicable fees have been paid as adopted by the city council, and as amended from time to time.

If the work authorized under a sign permit has not been completed within six months after the date of issuance, the permit shall become null and void and a new application for a sign permit shall be required. Issuance of a sign permit shall in no way prevent the city from later declaring the sign to be non-conforming or unlawful if, upon further review of available information, the sign is found not to comply with the requirements of this Section. 
5.5.11.8 Revocation of sign permit. If the work under any sign permit is proceeding in violation of this section, any other ordinance of the city, or should it be found that there has been any false statement or misrepresentation of a material fact in the application or plans on which the sign permit was based, the permit holder shall be notified of the violation.

CHAPTER 6.0 - DESIGN GUIDELINES 
    Development proposals inclusive of any of the following attributes require design review (architectural review) by the city's design review committee: 
A.  All new development located within the Urban Central Business (UCBD), Urban Core (UC) and Urban Village (UV) districts excluding detached single-family dwellings. 
B.  Any new development or redevelopment of buildings with two or more living units within any district. 
C.  Additions and exterior changes to all structures providing for non-residential uses and all structures with over three dwelling units existing prior to adoption of these land use regulations. 
D.  All mixed use developments. 
E.  New construction on property contiguous to a historic resource, excluding single-family detached structures. 
F.  New civic buildings or additions and exterior alterations to civic buildings. 
Standard design review requests are processed according to the procedural requirements of this chapter 6.0(architectural review procedure). 

6.1 - Standard guidelines. 
6.1.1  Context and architectural character. Proposed buildings should relate to the architectural characteristics of surrounding buildings, especially historic buildings, in order to be more compatible with their neighbors. The intent is not necessarily to replicate or emulate historic buildings, but to allow for a range of architectural expressions that complement the existing urban fabric. Therefore, proposed building designs should be based on and reflect thorough analysis of their surrounding patterns with regard to the following: 
 Building orientation; 
 Horizontal and vertical building articulation; 
 Architectural style; 
 Building scale and proportion; 
 Roof line and form; 
 Fenestration pattern and detailing; 
 Architectural detailing; 
 Exterior finish materials and colors; and 
 Lighting and landscape patterns. 
    Even where there is no consistent architectural character or pattern found in the surrounding area, building design and massing can be used to complement architectural characteristics of neighboring buildings. In some cases, where the existing context is not so well-defined, or may be undesirable, a proposed project can establish an architectural character and pattern from which future development can take its cues. 
6.1.2  Building massing and articulation. 
6.1.2.1 Each building should have at minimum a distinctive: horizontal base; occupied middle; and eave, cornice and/or parapet line that complement and balance one another. Horizontal articulations can be produced by material changes or applied facade elements. 
6.1.2.2 Each building should have a clear and harmonious pattern of vertically-oriented façade openings including entries, windows, and bays and columns or other exposed vertical supports. Vertical articulations can be produced by variations in rooflines; window groupings; applied façade elements such piers or pilasters, bay windows and balconies; entrance stoops and porches; and subtle changes in materials and vertical planes that create shadow lines and textural differences. Vertical elements break up long, monolithic building facades along the street. In the UCDB and UC areas, major vertical elements should be a maximum of 50 feet apart measured center-to-center, which reflects the historic parcel increment of much of downtown. In all other zones, major vertical elements should be a maximum of 40 ft apart measured center-to-center. 
6.1.2.3 In all districts other than UCBD, UC and UV, buildings should generally be designed to the scale and form of single-family houses. 
6.1.2.4  Building base -This may be as simple as a small projection of the wall surface and/or a different material or color. It may be created by a heavier or thicker design treatment of the entire ground floor for a building of two or more floors, or by a setback of the upper floors. 
6.1.2.5  Pattern of features -Windows, wall panels, pilasters, building bays, and storefronts should be based on a module derived from the building's structural bay spacing. Features based on this module should be carried across windowless walls to relieve blank, uninteresting surfaces. 
6.1.2.6  Building entrances to upper floors -Should be directly visible from the street and easy to identify. 
a.  For buildings in the UV, UCBD and UC. 
i.  Main building entrances -Should be easily identifiable and distinguishable from first floor storefronts. At least one of the following treatments is recommended: 
a)  Marked by a taller mass above, such as a tower, or within a volume that protrudes from the rest of the building surface; 
b)  Located in the center of the façade, as part of a symmetrical overall composition; 
c)  Accented by architectural elements, such as columns, overhanging roofs, awnings, and ornamental light fixtures; 
d)  Marked or accented by a change in the roofline or change in the roof type. 
e)  Entries to shops or lobbies should be spaced a maximum of 50 feet apart. 
ii.  Corner buildings -Should provide prominent corner entrances for shops and other activity-generating uses. Walls should be designed to be parallel to the right-of-way. 
b.  For buildings in other zones. 
i.  A clear entry sequence should lead from the sidewalk to the front door. The following elements are recommended: 
a)  Low hedges, fences and/or entry gates -To define the edge between the public street and private property. 
b)  Stairs, stoops, and open porches -Are recommended to create attractive semi-public spaces. 
(1)  Stairs -All stairs should be boxed and framed by attractive stepped bulkheads walls or balustrade railings. Bullnose treads are recommended. Open or "floating" exterior stairs should not be used. 
(2)  Open porches -Should have attractive bulkheads or balustrade railings and a roof that complements the pitch and materials of the main roof. 
(3)  Ornamental lighting -For porches and walks to add attractiveness, safety, and security. 
(4)  Freestanding landscape elements -Such as trellises, arbors, and special landscape materials that add character to yard spaces and/or accent the entry sequence. 
(5)  Pedestrian access to subsurface parking garages -Should be provided along the building frontages to increase streetside pedestrian activity. Access ways could link directly to the main entrance stoop/porch, or be provided in a separate location. In either case, they should be designed as a prominent, visible element in the overall façade composition. 
6.1.3  Building walls. 
6.1.3.1  Configuration. 
a.  Two or more wall materials may be combined on one façade only with one above the other, lighter materials above those more substantial (e.g. wood above stucco or masonry, or stucco above masonry); dependent, however, upon the chosen style. 
b.  All building elements that project from the building wall by more than 16 inches, including, but not limited to, decks, balconies, porch roofs and bays, shall be visibly supported by pilasters, piers, brackets, posts, columns, or beams that are sized proportionally to the structure above. This requirement does not apply to cantilevered elements that are typical for a specific style. 
6.1.3.2  Wall surface materials. 
a.  [Surfaces.] If the building mass and pattern of windows and doors is complex, simple wall surfaces are preferable (e.g. stucco); if the building volume and the pattern of wall openings are simple, additional wall texture and articulation should be employed (e.g. bricks or blocks, rusticated stucco, ornamental reliefs). In both cases, pilasters, columns, and cornices should be used to add visual interest and pedestrian scale. 
b.  [Palette.] The palette of wall materials should be kept to a minimum, preferably two (e.g. stucco and tile, brick and stone) or less. Using the same wall materials as adjacent or nearby buildings helps strengthen the district character. 
i.  Brick -Brick veneers should be mortared to give the appearance of structural brick. If used, brick tile applications should use wraparound corner and bullnose pieces to minimize a veneer appearance. 
ii.  Stone and stone veneers -Are appropriate as a basic building material or as special material for wall panels or sills in combination with other materials, such as brick or concrete. 
iii.  Poured-in-place concrete -Options in terms of formwork, pigments, and aggregates should be explored to create rich surfaces. When used, include accents such as ceramic tile or stone for decorative effect. 
c.  [Ceramic tile.] Ceramic tile is recommended as an accent material. 
d.  [Stucco.] Stucco and/or painted stucco may be used in order to reduce maintenance and increase wear. All stucco surfaces should be smooth to prevent the collection of dirt and surface pollutants, and the deterioration of painted surfaces. 
e.  Wood siding. Painted horizontal lap wood or cementitious siding with detailed trim is the only recommended "Main Street" use of wood. For residential application other wood siding configurations are acceptable. 
f.  [Curtain wall systems.] Curtain wall systems -should only be used for limited areas, such as connections between buildings, entrance lobbies, etc. 
g.  Parapet and cornice cap flashings. Note: Sheet metal parapet cap flashings should be painted to match wall or trim color. 
h.  Inappropriate wall surface materials. 
i.  [Simulated finishes.] Simulated finishes, such as artificial or manmade stone. 
ii.  Wood shingles and shakes. Vertical board and batten, shingles, or shakes are not recommended in the UCBD and UC districts; they have a residential character. 
iii.  Plywood siding. 
6.1.3.3  Side and rear building façades -Should have a level of trim and finish compatible with the front façade, particularly if they are visible from streets, adjacent parking areas or residential buildings. 
6.1.3.4  Blank wall areas -Without windows or doors are only permitted on internal-block side-property line walls. Such blank walls should reflect the ground level building increment, building massing and organization, and façade compositions guidelines, A through D above. Surface reliefs, decorative vines, and/or architectural murals and other surface enhancements should also be considered. Any blank exterior wall should also be treated with a graffiti-resistant coating. 
6.1.3.5  Color -In general, drab earth tones should not be used. Building walls should contrast trim colors; for example, neutral or light walls with dark colors and saturated hues for accent and ornamental colors; white or light window and door trim on a medium or dark building wall. Colors of adjacent buildings should be taken into consideration. 
a.  Secondary color -Can be used to give additional emphasis to architectural features such as building bases (like a wainscot), plasters, cornices, capitals, and bands. 
b.  Bright colors -Should be used sparingly. Typical applications are fabric awnings. A restrained use of bright colors allows display windows and merchandise to catch the eye and stand out in the visual field. 
6.1.4  Wall openings. 
6.1.4.1 Windows are an important element of building composition and an indicator of overall building quality: 
a.  [Unifying elements.] All windows within a building, large or small, should be related in operating type, proportions, and trim. Other unifying elements should be used, such as common sill or header lines. 
b.  For storefront buildings. Window-to-wall proportion- In general, upper stories should have a window-to-wall area proportion (typically 30 percent to 50 percent) that is smaller than that of ground floor storefronts. 
c.  Window inset. Glass should be inset a minimum of three inches from the exterior wall surface to add relief to the wall surface; this is especially important for stucco buildings. 
d.  [Frames and sills.] Shaped frames and sills should be used to enhance openings and add additional relief. They should be proportional to the glass area framed; e.g. a larger window should have thicker framing members. 
e.  Mullions. "True divided light" windows or sectional windows are recommended where a divided window design is desired; "snap-in" grilles or mullions should not be used. 
f.  Glazing. Clear glazing is strongly recommended. Reflective glazing should not be used. If tinted glazing is used, the tint should be kept as light as possible; green, gray, and blue are recommended. 
g.  Replacement/renovation. Wood windows should be replaced with wood windows of the same operating type (e.g. double-hung, casement, etc.; vinyl-covered wood windows are available for lower maintenance). If aluminum replacement windows or doors are used, they should be: 
i.  Same operating type and orientation as the original windows (e.g. do not replace a double hung window with a horizontal sliding window). 
a)  Factory painted or fluorocoated to match the original; color anodized is also acceptable. 
b)  Similar in size and thickness to the original frame and mullions. 
6.1.4.2  Storefronts are like small buildings with their own base, "roofline," and pattern of window and door openings. 
a.  Base. A panel of tile or other special material is recommended below display windows. Materials recommended for walls (next section) are generally suitable. Base materials should be the same or "heavier" materials visually than walls. 
i.  Brick and wood should only be used if the rest of the wall surface is the same material; neither material should be used exclusively. 
ii.  Ceramic tile is frequently used as a storefront base. Dark tile with light stucco is an effective combination. Different colors and sizes of tile may be used for decorative effect. 
b.  Display windows. Large pane windows encompassing a minimum of 60 percent of the storefront surface area are recommended. Where privacy is desired for restaurants, professional services, etc., windows should be divided into smaller panes. 
c.  Clerestory windows are horizontal panels of glass between the storefront and the second floor. They are a traditional element of "main street" buildings, and are recommended for all new or renovated storefronts. Clerestory windows can be good locations for neon, painted-window, and other relatively non-obtrusive types of signs. 
d.  Recessed entries are recommended as another traditional element of the main street storefront. Recommended treatments include: 
i.  Special paving materials such as ceramic tile; 
ii.  Ornamental ceilings such as coffering; 
iii.  Decorative light fixtures. 
e.  Doors should be substantial and well detailed. They are the one part of the storefront that patrons will invariably touch and feel. They should match the materials, design and character of the display window framing. "Narrowline" aluminum frame doors are not recommended. 
f.  Cornices should be provided at the second floor (or roofline for a one-story building) to differentiate the storefront from upper levels of the building and to add visual interest; this also allows the storefront to function as the base for the rest of the building. 
g.  New or renovated storefronts within historic buildings should emulate or re-create a previous storefront (from historic photos or drawings) in order to harmonize with the overall building architecture. This can be flexibly interpreted, for example when the general form of a new storefront is like the original but the materials are contemporary. 
6.1.5  Roofs. 
6.1.5.1  Forms. Roof forms should complement the building mass and match the principal building in terms of style, detailing and materials. Double-pitched roofs (such as gable, hip, pyramid), dormer windows, and chimneys are recommended to add variety and visual interest. Roofs of historic buildings in Bradenton and neighboring areas should be used as an inspiration for new designs. Flat roofs are acceptable in the UCBD ad UC districts if a strong, attractively detailed cornice and/or parapet wall is provided. Single-pitched or "shed" roofs should not be used for the principal building. 
6.1.5.2  Parapet walls are recommended; they should have a distinct shape or profile (e.g. a gable, arc, or raised center). 
6.1.5.3  "Commercial mansards," i.e., wraparound roofing panels that do not enclose a habitable floor or rooftop mechanical equipment, should not be used. 
6.1.5.4  Mansards should only be used when emulating a traditional building style that typically employs mansard roofs, (e.g. beaux arts, Victorian, etc). The following guidelines should apply: 
a.  Buildings are three stories or greater height; 
b.  They enclose no more and no less than one floor of habitable space; and 
c.  Dormer windows and other architectural features should occupy a minimum of 25 percent of the roof length. 
6.1.5.5  Accent elements such as flags, cut-out openings, grilles and latticework, ornamental medallions or building numbers are recommended. 
6.1.5.6  Mechanical equipment on rooftops should be screened, preferably behind a parapet roof. Latticework, louvered panels, and other treatments that are compatible with the building's architecture may also be appropriate. 
6.1.5.7  Materials. Encouraged roof surface materials are identified as follows: 
a.  Clay, ceramic or concrete tile -Colorful glazed ceramic tiles are recommended for decorative roof shapes, such as parapets, domes, and turrets. 
b.  Metal seam roofing should be anodized, fluorocoated or painted. Copper and lead roofs should be natural or oxidized. 
6.1.6  Miscellaneous building elements. 
6.1.6.1  Trellises, canopies, awnings and other building-mounted accessories. 
a.  Awnings are recommended. They should be a colorful fabric mounted over a metal structure that is framed and attractive in design. Fabric awnings are generally preferable to permanent canopies. Backlit awnings are strongly discouraged. 
b.  Trellises and canopies. Materials, colors, and form should be derived from the building architecture. 
c.  Height and projection. Trellises, canopies and awnings should be a minimum of nine feet above the sidewalk, and project no more than seven feet out from the building wall. 
d.  Placement of trellises, canopies and awnings should be above the display windows and below the storefront cornice or sign panel. They should not cover piers, pilasters, clerestory windows or other architectural features. An individual awning or canopy for each storefront or building bay complements the building more effectively than one continuous awning does. 
e.  Accessories . Ornamental brackets and poles should be used to add variety to the street. Hanging flower or plant baskets suspended from ornamental brackets of metal or wood are recommended for storefronts. 
6.1.6.2  Accessory buildings. 
a.  General. Outbuildings of all types should have architectural treatments derived from the main building: surface materials, trim, fenestration, roof materials, and colors. 
b.  Freestanding garages should be unobtrusive, preferably located at the rear of properties to minimize visual impact. 
c.  Single-car garage doors are strongly recommended, with windows, surface panels, trim, and other forms of architectural detailing to reduce their impact and scale. 
d.  Built-in garages should blend with the form of the residence. 
6.1.7  Site improvements. 
6.1.7.1 Public and semi-public open space where provided as part of new development; e.g. pedestrian spaces, arcades, malls, courtyards, etc. 
a.  Spatial definition. Spaces should be defined by buildings or landscape elements on a minimum of two sides. 
b.  Linkage. Spaces should be publicly accessible during daylight hours and linked to adjacent streets and sidewalks. 
c.  Sequence. Gateways, trellises, special lighting, planting, etc., should be used to create a sequence for pedestrians; for example, an ornamental gate at the sidewalk, a passage lined with columns, and arrival at a courtyard. 
6.1.7.2 Walls, fences and piers should be used to define public and private boundaries and spaces. 
a.  Design. Walls, fences, and piers should be designed to be compatible with the character of the principal building(s). 
i.  Walls and fences should be open and/or low along street frontages to maintain both a public character and sight distance for driveways where they occur. 
ii.  Fence and wall panels should be divided into regular modules that reflect the module of the principal building. 
iii.  Thick and thin elements should be used, with thicker pieces for supports and panel divisions. Fence posts and support columns should be emphasized and/or built-up. 
iv.  Walls should have a base and coping. 
b.  Materials should be compatible with the principal building. Post or pier materials may differ from fence materials, such as metal fences with masonry piers. 
c.  Fences. Wrought iron, cast iron, aluminum, or welded steel ornamental fences; wood or PVC picket fences of substantial design. Metal fences also may be mounted on a low masonry wall, and/or spanning masonry piers. Wooden fences in non-residential areas should be painted, preferably a light color. 
d.  Walls. Recommended are brick, stone, concrete, precast concrete, and stucco-faced concrete or concrete block. 
e.  Piers. For spatial separation, a line of piers is acceptable. A continuous chain suspended between piers can be an effective and attractive device for creating a separation. 
i.  Spacing. No more than eight feet on center. 
ii.  Thickness. At least 16 inches per side or diameter. 
iii.  Height. At least three feet, no more than six feet. 
iv.  Materials. Should be the same as or complementary to the principal building. 
f.  Not recommended. 
i.  Chain link fences. If used, chain link should be coated with nylon, preferably of a dark color. Chain link fences can be made more attractive by using masonry or heavy wood posts. 
ii.  Unfinished or unsurfaced concrete block walls should not be used; block walls should be coated with stucco or a similar surface. 
iii.  Rustic wood fences should not be used. 
iv.  Barbed wire/plaza wire should not be used. 
6.1.7.3 Paving materials recommended for pedestrian surfaces are listed below. In general, a maximum of two materials should be combined in a particular application: 
a.  Stone such as slate or granite. 
b.  Brick pavers. 
c.  Concrete unit pavers. 
d.  Poured-in-place concrete with any of the following treatments: integral pigment color, special aggregate, special scoring pattern, ornamental insets such as tile, pattern- stamped. 
e.  Not recommended-Asphalt, with the exception of bike paths. 
6.1.7.4 Furnishings, art work, and special features are recommended for public and/or common outdoor spaces. 
a.  [Seating recommendations.] Permanent outdoor seating is recommended in all publicly-accessible ways and spaces. Seating should be either: 
i.  Incorporated as part of the design of the building base, or; 
ii.  Custom designed in a style related to the architecture of the building (permanent benches of stone, brick or precast concrete), or; 
iii.  Catalog items of substantial materials appropriate for the center of the city; 
b.  Portable seating. Movable chairs, tables for cafes and other furniture should be of substantial materials, preferably metal or wood rather than plastic. Tables used for outdoor dining within the public right-of-way (i.e. in sidewalk areas) shall be a maximum of three feet in diameter if round and three [feet] along the longest side if rectangular. 
c.  Street clocks, directory kiosks, and permanent freestanding showcase displays are encouraged for commercial buildings, subject to city review for adequate clearances, safety, and design. Designs should reflect the architecture of the sponsoring building or storefront 
d.  Fountains are recommended in open courtyard and passage spaces. The design and materials should be related to the principal building. 
e.  Public art such as sculpture, wall murals and other paintings, lighting displays and special public open spaces are encouraged. 
i.  Location of public art should be in highly visible places specifically designed or modified for the purpose of accommodating it; public art should not be located in semi-private areas such as the rear of buildings or in courtyards. 
ii.  Symbolic content of public art should relate to and represent the rich history of the city where appropriate; abstract as well as literal representative elements are appropriate. 
iii.  Murals should reflect the color and architectural composition of the buildings on which they are painted, and, to the extent appropriate, that of neighboring buildings. Murals are strongly recommended for exposed firewalls and other windowless wall areas that extend two or more floors above neighboring buildings. See section 4.3.14 for specific use standards for public art murals. 
f.  Surface parking lots should be included in space defining elements, such as arcades, trellises, columns, light standards, walls and railings, stairs and ramps, trees, climbing vines, arbors, and hedges to provide visual interest; use of these elements should be consistent with the principal building and other site features. 
6.1.7.5 Plant material and landscaping should contribute to a comfortable, yet urban, downtown environment. Drought tolerant plant materials should be used as appropriate. 
a.  Plant materials along street frontages should contribute to a harmonious and civic character. 
i.  Street trees shall be planted along all streets at a spacing of approximately 30 feet on center to create a buffer between pedestrians and automobiles. Consistency in tree species, tree size, and spacing should be used to establish a strong street identity. 
ii.  Trees with open branching structures should be used. Deciduous trees are recommended to create shade in the summer. 
iii.  Curb side planting strips shall be drought-tolerant grasses or low-growing ground cover; materials that might cause pedestrians to trip shall not be used. 
iv.  Streetside planting areas should have a simple palette of plant species. Drought-tolerant and/or native plants should be used. Common non-native species may be approved by the director of planning and community development. 
v.  Plant materials that exhibit annual or seasonal color[are] recommended to highlight special locations (e.g. flanking main building entries and driveways). 
b.  Plant materials in other locations should be selected and placed to reflect both ornamental and functional characteristics. 
i.  Deciduous trees - should be the predominant large plant material used. They should be located adjacent to buildings and within parking areas to provide shade in summer and allow sun in winter. Species should be selected to be drought-tolerant, provide fall color and minimize litter and other maintenance problems. 
ii.  Evergreen shrubs and trees should be used as a screening device, for example, along rear property lines, around mechanical appurtenances. 
iii.  Flowering shrubs and trees should be used where they can be most appreciated: adjacent to walks and recreational areas, or framing building entries, stairs, and walks. 
iv.  Plants with annual or seasonal color are recommended to highlight special locations, such as courtyards, building entrances, or access drives. 
v.  Decorative vines should be considered for use along fences, property boundaries, perimeter walls, and on blank building elevations. 
vi.  Palm trees should be used sparingly, and only used to establish an identification of certain streets. Palms planted in other locations should be singular or in tight groupings so as not to compete with the visual importance of these streets. 
vii.  Drought-tolerant and/or native plants should generally be used. 
c.  Mounding earth-Freestanding earth berms and/or earth berms against buildings are a suburban landscape approach that are not appropriate in the downtown planning areas. 
CHAPTER 7.0 - LIGHTING 

7.1 - [Purpose.] 
    This section [chapter] contains information and standards used for all development where lighting may be necessary. 
7.1.1  Intent. These outdoor lighting regulations intend to protect people and property values from the nuisance and harm of excessive outdoor lighting that: 
a.  Hinders or decreases visibility. 
b.  Glares into the eyes of drivers looking for safe nighttime visibility. 
c.  Creates a blinding brightness that leaves high-contrast, unsafely dark, shadowed areas. 
d.  Creates an artificial atmospheric flow that prevents residents from enjoying the night sky around their homes. 
e.  Spills into the yards, homes and streets of neighborhoods trying to maintain a visually calm residential character. 
7.1.2  Applicability. Unless exempted in exemptions section, these lighting regulations apply to and require a lighting plan for: 
a.  Development and redevelopment of non-residential projects, multi-family dwelling residential projects, and common improvements in other residential projects, e.g., recreational facilities. 
b.  Outdoor lighting fixtures added to or intensified in non-residential projects, multi-family projects, and common improvements in single-family residential projects, e.g. vehicle use areas and recreational facilities. Routine maintenance, e.g., cleaning and changing bulbs, ballasts, starters, housings, lenses and other similar components, shall not constitute intensification provided such changes do not result in a higher lumen output compared to the fixture when new, i.e., a light brighter than the intensity of the original installation as determined by the lumen rating printed on the bulb, the shipping package, or the specification sheet. 
7.1.3  Exemptions. 
a.  Low intensity. Lighting to safely illuminate street address numbers, residential building entries, residential driveways, and residential yards with light sources rated less than 800 lumens or with fixtures shielded to block direct illumination beyond these areas. 
b.  Streets. Lighting to safety illuminate streets, including, but not limited to, their driving lanes, sidewalks, roadside recovery shoulders, and emergency lanes. Such fixtures shall have full horizontal shielding to prevent direct illumination above the fixture and to minimize direct illumination of residences nearby. 
c.  Emergency. Lighting for emergency safety repairs or natural disaster recovery. 
d.  Construction. Lighting for building or site construction not exceeding ten days during any consecutive 12 months. 
e.  Road and utility repairs. Lighting for construction, renovation, or repair of roads and utilities. 
f.  Signs. Lighting for signs permitted by the land use regulations, under the following conditions: 
i.  Externally illuminated signs shall have full oblique shielding aiming the light down onto the sign. 
ii.  Internally illuminated signs shall comply with the driver vision impairment requirements of this section [chapter] unless the signs serve only to provide driver directions without interfering with safe driver vision or traffic controls. 
iii.  The light from a sign shall not exceed the measurable spill illumination limits of this section [chapter] or violate the driver vision impairment requirements of this section [chapter]. 
iv.  The extensive illuminated area of the background shall count toward the maximum sign area permitted by sign regulations. 
7.1.4  Religious or national symbols and flags. Lighting for religious or national symbols and flags permitted by this land development code, under the following conditions: 
a.  Symbols and flags that need illumination should have full oblique shielding but may have spotlights aimed up only to illuminate the symbol or flag. 
b.  Internally illuminated symbols shall comply with the driver vision impairment requirements of this section [chapter]. 
c.  The light for a symbol or flag shall not exceed the measurable spill illumination limits of this section [chapter] or violate the driver vision impairment requirements of this section [chapter]. 
7.1.5  Underwater lamps . Underwater lamps in swimming pools and other water bodies for safety. 
7.1.6  Safety . Lighting required by government law for safety as follows: 
a.  Lamps for exit signs, traffic control, waterway navigation, and aviation navigation shall have no restriction. 
b.  Lamps for ramps, stairs, handicap access, boat dock decks, and other safety purposes shall have fully shielded fixtures aiming the light down onto the area requiring illumination by law. 
7.2. - Illumination limits. 
7.2.1  Direct illumination. Unless otherwise exempted, all outdoor lighting fixtures shall have full oblique shielding so that a property's light sources do not directly illuminate another property that has an outdoor lighting protected area. 
7.2.2  Driver vision impairment . Lights shall not impair the vision of drivers and interfere with safe driving. A light source shall have shields to prevent it from glaring into the eyes of drivers where drivers need to see structures, signs, other vehicles, and overhead clearances to a height of 16 feet. Affected driving areas include streets, driveways, parking lots, and other vehicle use areas on site or off site. 
7.2.3.  Measurable spill illumination limits. The total illumination caused by all of a property's outdoor lighting, including light sources, diffraction, and reflections from on-site objects, shall not illuminate another property in excess of the following limits: 
a.  0.2 foot-candles on property with outdoor lighting protected areas but not including the street rights-of-way. 
b.  1.5 foot-candles on street rights-of-way because such limited coincidental illumination of a street will not constitute a nuisance to people using the street. 
7.3 - Fixture height. 
7.3.1. Fixture height, measured from finished grade at ground level to the bottom of the light source, determines the vertical point from which the light projects downward. Regardless of height limits, below, prevention of spill illumination may require lower heights according to calculations and plots in the lighting plan. 
7.4. - Limits. 
7.4.1 All light fixtures located within 100 feet of any other property that has an outdoor lighting protected area shall not exceed 20 feet in height. 
7.4.2 All light fixtures elsewhere shall not exceed 35 feet in height. 
7.5 - Controllers, timers and sensors. 
7.5.1. Lights shall not illuminate when not needed. Unnecessary light constitutes a nuisance and a harm that timers, light sensors, switches, motion detectors, and occupancy sensors may prevent. 
7.5.2 All electrical circuits for outdoor lighting shall have manually controlled switches conveniently located for manual operation. 
7.5.3 Light sensors shall automatically turn off lights when they sense adequate daylight. 
7.5.4 Timers shall automatically turn off and turn on lights when their clocks arrive at pre-set times corresponding to the times needing the lights. Alternatively, the controller may dim lights or allow fewer lights to remain on for security and safety. Motion detectors and occupancy sensors may interrupt to turn on lights for timed durations. 
7.6 - Special lights. 
7.6.1  Aerial lights. No fixture shall aim light upward to search, sweep, or move through the sky. 
7.6.2  Accent lights. Light used to accent architectural features, fascia, landscaping, art, or similar objects shall not directly illuminate outdoor lighting protected areas. All such light shall terminate on opaque surfaces within the property. 
7.6.3  Boat dock and marina lights. 
a.  All lighting for boat docks and marinas, public or private, shall provide shields to prevent spill illumination beyond the property and beyond the permitted boat docking and turning areas. 
b.  If required by government law for safe navigation, then red and green navigation lights may mark channels in the waterways. 
c.  If required by government law for safe navigation, then lamps for boat dock decks shall have fully shielded fixtures aiming the light down onto the area requiring illumination by law. 
7.6.4  Canopy lights . An opaque canopy, soffit, or overhang may serve as the required horizontal cut off and fixture shielding for lights fully recessed into the underside of the canopy. Such shielding shall appear as part of the fixture detail required on a lighting plan. 
7.6.5  Fascia lights. Fascia on a canopy shall not include fixtures for outdoor lighting of the site or buildings. A sign on the fascia may include lights to illuminate the sign, but the illuminated area of the fascia shall count toward the maximum sign area permitted by sign regulations. 
7.6.6  Gas pump, convenience business, automatic teller machine, and other required security lights . Whenever state or federal law requires certain intense illumination levels for security, then the location, intensity, quantity, height, shielding, and aim of such lights shall satisfy such requirement while still complying with these regulations, e.g. preventing direct illumination off site, to the maximum extent possible. 
7.6.7  Outline lights. Illuminated tubing, strings of lights, back-lighted objectives, or similar fixtures that outline structures, sales areas, roofs, doors, windows, plants, or similar areas shall not light upward. 
7.6.8  Projection lights. All projected light, laser or otherwise, shall terminate on an opaque surface. 
7.6.9  Required lights. Whenever state or federal law requires certain illumination, e.g., safe access, then the location, intensity, quantity, height, shielding, and aim of such lights shall satisfy such requirements while still complying with these regulations, e.g., preventing direct illumination off-site, to the maximum extent possible. 
7.7 - Commercial stadium and public recreation lights. 
7.7.1 Whenever players in sporting events and recreational activities require certain intense illumination levels for safety, then the location, intensity, quantity, height, shielding, and aim of such lights shall satisfy such requirements while still complying with these regulations, e.g., preventing direct illumination off site, to the maximum extent possible. 
7.7.2 With the exception of commercial stadiums, the illumination of outdoor public recreational activities shall stop at 11:00 p.m. for the remainder of the night. An activity should begin earlier if it will normally exceed this time limit. Regardless, an activity already in progress from an earlier starting time may continue with illumination until no later than 11:30 p.m. Other lower level illumination may remain for safe spectator departure and security. 
7.8. - Lighting plan.

CHAPTER 9.0 - MANUFACTURING DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM 

9.1 - Authority. 
    This chapter is adopted to establish a local manufacturing development program for the city pursuant to F.S. §§ 163.325-163.3252 (the "Manufacturing Competitiveness Act" or "Act"). 
(Ord. No. 3030, § 1(Att. A), 7-25-18) 
9.2 - Purpose and intent. 
    The manufacturing development program established pursuant to this chapter is intended to provide a quick, efficient, and comprehensive method whereby manufacturing businesses may be established or expanded within a designated portion of the city with minimum further local development review. The process ensures that manufacturing businesses will be supported with adequate facilities and infrastructure and that potential adverse impacts to natural resources and adjacent land uses are sufficiently mitigated. 
    This section provides for master development plan (MDP) approval authorizing specified manufacturing uses at specified development intensities for a specific site. The MDP constitutes a comprehensive local government development approval and upon securing this approval, only building permits to ensure compliance with the state building code and any other applicable state mandated life safety code shall be required to build, operate and subsequently expand or otherwise physically modify for an extensive period of time the manufacturing development established by the MDP. 
    It is also the intent of this chapter that, in conjunction with the city's master development plan approval process, manufacturing businesses located within the master development plan eligibility area (MDPEA) established herein shall be eligible to apply for state-level permits through the state-level coordinated manufacturing development approval process established pursuant to the Act. 
(Ord. No. 3030, § 1(Att. A), 7-25-18) 
9.3 - Master development plan eligibility area (MDPEA). 
    The city establishes the master development plan eligibility area (MDPEA) as the real property included within the manufacturing development overlay (MDO) as outlined in section 9.4. 
(Ord. No. 3030, § 1(Att. A), 7-25-18) 
9.4 - Applicability and eligibility. 
    An application for MDP approval shall comply with the following eligibility criteria: 
a.  Location within the MDPEA. The real property included in the application shall be located within the boundaries of the MDPEA. 
b.  Future land use category. The applicable comprehensive plan future land use category (FLUC) for real property to be included in the application shall be 1. The industrial FLUM category; and 2. The urban commercial corridor FLUM, but only when such real property is owned by the manufacturer or manufacturing developer, is adjacent to the industrial FLUM category property and is to be incorporated into the manufacturing project master development plan. 
c.  Zoning. The real property included in the application shall be located within industrial zoning district (I) and when applicable as above in the urban commercial corridor zoning district (UCC). 
d.  Configuration of the MDP. The MDP project may consist of either a single parcel of land, or of multiple parcels or tracts, so long as each parcel or tract is located in the MDPEA, owned by one entity, and is of sufficient size and configuration to accommodate a principal use authorized in the MDP. 
(Ord. No. 3030, § 1(Att. A), 7-25-18) 
9.5 - Vested rights. 
    Those existing development rights authorized by the city before the approval of the MDP, and associated with the real property included in an MDP application, shall be recognized as vested development rights (subject to the requirements of the comprehensive plan and applicable law), if so requested by the manufacturer. 
(Ord. No. 3030, § 1(Att. A), 7-25-18) 
9.6 - MDP approval process. 
9.6.1  Master development plan certification of eligibility. An applicant who intends to file a MDP application shall first apply for a master development plan certification of eligibility (MDPCE) which documents the applicant's eligibility to participate in the manufacturing development program. Issuance of a MDPCE shall be based upon the applicant demonstrating that: 
a.  The site that the applicant seeks to establish, expand, modify, or improve for a manufacturing use meets the criteria set forth in section 9.4; and 
b.  The proposed or existing use of the property qualifies as a manufacturing use. 
    The MDPCE establishes eligibility to participate in the manufacturing development program. It is the intent of this chapter that an MDPCE shall also be recognized by agencies of the state as certification of the applicant's eligibility to participate in the state-level coordinated manufacturing development approval process as established in the Act. The city's planning and community development (PCD) department shall establish the necessary forms for application and issuance of MDPCEs in accordance with this chapter and the Act. 
(Ord. No. 3030, § 1(Att. A), 7-25-18) 
9.7 - Pre-application conference. 
    Upon obtaining a MDPCE, the applicant shall schedule and attend a pre-application conference with PCD staff. At the pre-application conference, the applicant and staff will meet to discuss the applicant's proposed development plans and the application process. The applicant and staff will discuss the development project and identify any requirements which may not be applicable for the specific proposed MDP, and discuss issues anticipated to arise during the proposed MDP review in keeping with this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 3030, § 1(Att. A), 7-25-18) 
9.8 - Application process. 
    Upon payment of an appropriate review fee established by the city, applications for MDP approval shall be generally reviewed as would site plans with only those modifications to the site plan process that are expressly set forth in this chapter. Accordingly, a MDP may serve as the mechanism for granting other local development approvals required under these LUR including CLOS in the same manner as a final site plan but for the effective term of the MDP. 
    The application, required review submittals, and the review process shall provide for a comprehensive, unified staff review to avoid unnecessary costs, duplication, redundancy, and waste of resources, and to ensure efficiency in the approval process for the MDP. Staff review shall be completed within 90 days of the application being determined complete (unless extended by mutual agreement of the applicant and the city) and transmitted for action pursuant to this chapter.
