PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the city of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1972 Code, as supplemented through September 18, 1978, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Mayor and Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1972 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the tenth section of Chapter 5 is 5-10. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 3-8 and 3-9 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 3-8.1, 3-8.2 and 3-8.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 6 and 7, it will be designated as Chapter 6.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of B. Meade White, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

    The publishers are most grateful to Mr. Herman Hill, the former City Manager, and Roy E. Barnes, City Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

    Service enterprise means an entity engaged primarily in finance, insurance, and real estate activity or activities listed as provided in the Act. 
(b)  Enterprise zones. 
(1)  Purposes. This section, including its subsections, has been enacted based upon a recognized need for revitalization in geographic areas within the city that are suffering or may suffer from disinvestment, underdevelopment, and economic decline and is intended to provide encouragement and incentives to private businesses to reinvest, renovate, restore, improve and rehabilitate such areas for new housing construction and the economic viability and profitability of businesses and commerce and to generate increased employment opportunities for residents of such areas. 
(2)  Qualifying business or service enterprise. A qualifying business or service enterprise is an enterprise which increased employment by five (5) or more new full-time job equivalents in a designated enterprise zone and which provides additional economic stimulus in such zone. The quality and quantity of such additional economic stimulus shall be determined, on a case-by-case basis, by the mayor and council. Such business or service enterprise may be new, an expansion or reinvestment of an existing business or service enterprise, or a successor to such business or service enterprise.

Property tax exemptions granted to business or service enterprises that continue to qualify for the exemption shall continue for the full term of the incentives. 
f.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the city may enter into agreements with qualifying business or service enterprises in designated enterprise zones to provide for modification or termination of any tax and fee exemptions and abatements. 
g.  Qualifying business or service enterprises in designated enterprise zones may be eligible for incentives other than those provided under this section, including economic development incentives described elsewhere in this Code, and including fee abatements or reductions for occupation taxes, regulatory fees and business inspections. 
(5)  Time limitations. An area designated as an enterprise zone shall remain in existence for ten (10) years from the first day of the calendar year immediately following its designation as an enterprise zone. Except as otherwise provided, property tax incentives granted to a qualified business or service enterprise shall remain in effect for the full term of the exemption period.

The permits and licenses clerk or any person authorized in writing by the city may examine the books, papers, records, financial reports, equipment and other facilities of any licensee liable for the tax in order to verify the accuracy of any return made, or if no return is made by the licensee, to ascertain and determine the amount required to be paid.

    Any person found guilty of violating any of the provisions of this article shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor offense and upon conviction in the municipal court shall be punished as provided in section 1-8.

ARTICLE IV. - ENFORCEMENT 

Sec. 3-181. - Compliance with chapter. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful for any person to sell or offer for sale at wholesale or retail any alcoholic beverages without having first complied with the provisions of this chapter. 
(b)  The police department shall from time to time visit licensed premises and determine compliance with this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2000-30, 11-20-00) 
Sec. 3-182. - Criminal penalties for violation of chapter; administrative actions. 
(a)  Alleged violations of this chapter may be cited to any court as provided by law and ordinance. Convictions under this chapter shall be punishable in the municipal court by a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or imprisonment for sixty (60) days, or both. Convictions may be considered due cause for suspension or revocation of any license by the governing authority. 
(b)  The governing authority may and normally shall take administrative action under this chapter independent of court citations or the lack thereof, and independent of the disposition or lack of disposition thereof. 
(c)  The intent of the table below is to be a guide for the governing authority in providing for fair and consistent procedures and possible penalties for alleged violations of this chapter. The authority to deviate from this guide, including but not limited to provisions regarding show cause hearings, computation of number of offenses, time periods, and penalties, is expressly reserved to the governing authority, as is the authority to consider mitigating circumstances in deciding upon possible penalties. The table calls for increased sanctions per increased violations or per increased class or seriousness; thus, among classes, a third offense under the least serious class III triggers sanctions that are reached on a second offense in the more serious class II or on a first offense in the most serious class I; and within the same class, sanctions increase as the number of violations increase. The table reflects a willingness to give a licensee the benefit of the doubt, with respect to administrative action, for an initial offense on the part of the licensee or the employee of the licensee, but to be less willing to do so upon subsequent violations. The table assumes routine enforcement efforts on the part of law enforcement officers.

(a)  Relief from the application of the provisions of this chapter to uses and activities upon privately owned real property may be granted by the mayor and city council upon a finding that compliance with such provision will result in a hardship to the property or owner that is substantially unwarranted by the protection of the public health, safety or general welfare, and the need for consistency among all properties similarly situated. 
(b)  Such relief may be granted only to the extent necessary to alleviate such unnecessary hardship and not as a convenience to the applicant nor to gain any advantage or interest over similarly situated properties. 
(c)  A variance may be granted in whole or in part, or with conditions, in such individual case of unnecessary hardship upon a finding by the mayor and city council that: 
(1)  The application of the chapter would create an unnecessary hardship; and 
(2)  Relief, if granted, would not cause substantial detriment to the public good or impair the purpose and intent of this chapter. 
(d)  If denied, an application for a variance affecting the same property shall not be reconsidered for a period of twelve (12) months from the date of denial; provided, however, that the mayor and city council may reduce the waiting period under extenuating circumstances or on its own motion.

(h)  An application shall include such descriptions, maps, drawings or other information as needed to clearly illustrate or explain the action requested. The city manager or his/her designee may request such additional information from the applicant as necessary to provide a full understanding of the variance application. 
(i)  Once the record has been assembled, the city manager or his/her designee shall schedule the variance application for consideration at the next meeting of the mayor and city council for which adequate public notice can be given.

One (1) such sign shall be placed in a conspicuous location along each street frontage of the property for which the variance has been requested. If the property has no street frontage, the sign shall be placed on each street where access to the property will be gained. Said signs shall remain posted until a final decision by the city has been rendered. It is the responsibility of the applicant to post the signs and to maintain the signs during the posting period. Failure to post and maintain the signs continuously may prohibit consideration of the variance application at any scheduled public hearing. In the event the signs are not posted continuously, the city, in its sole discretion, may require the reposting and readvertising prior to any future public hearing, for which the applicant shall pay an additional readvertising fee. The city may also in its sole discretion, continue, hold, approve, or dismiss the application. Any dismissal under the provisions of this paragraph shall be with prejudice unless specifically noted as being without prejudice by the city. 
(l)  An affidavit by the applicant shall be submitted to the city manager or his/her designee that notice has been given to surrounding property owners as a convenience, as follows: 
(1)  No less than fifteen (15) days prior to the first public hearing, the applicant shall mail a notice to all persons owning property located in whole or in part within two hundred (200) feet of any portion of the property that is the subject of the application.

(2)  The applicant shall submit an affidavit with a copy of the notice to the city manager or his/her designee no less than fifteen (15) days prior to the first public hearing, listing the property owners and certifying the date that the notices were mailed.

(n)  Work sessions of the mayor and council may be convened from time-to-time to discuss pending matters prior to public hearings. Work sessions at which variance applications are to be discussed shall be attended by the applicant or representative thereof with authority to make binding commitments to the city with respect to any stipulations that may be offered in connection with such application.

(q)  The following rules shall apply to the conduct of the public hearing: 
(1)  The presiding official shall conduct the public hearing informally, as strict adherence to the rules of evidence is not required. A goal is a fair hearing. 
(2)  The applicant shall first present evidence in support of the application. After the applicant has completed the presentation of evidence, opponents shall present such relevant evidence as they think appropriate after being recognized by the presiding official. 
(3)  All parties participating in the public hearing shall introduce only relevant evidence. 
(4)  All parties particiapting shall have the right to present witnesses and to cross-examine witnesses. 
(5)  The applicant shall have an opportunity to present rebuttal evidence, but such evidence shall be limited to points or issues raised by the opponents. 
(r)  At any public hearing on the application, action shall be considered by vote of the members present. A motion to approve or deny an application must be approved by an affirmative vote of at least a majority of the sitting members in order for the motion to be approved. If a motion to approve fails, the application is automatically denied. If a motion to deny fails, another motion would be in order. A tie vote on a motion for approval shall be deemed a denial of the application. A tie vote on any other motion shall be deemed to be no action, and another motion would be in order. If no action is taken by the mayor and city council, it shall be considered tabled and action deferred to the next regular meeting of the mayor and city council. 
(s)  In taking action on a variance application, the mayor and city council may: 
(1)  Approve;

For said hearing, the application shall be republished and posted as described in this article. 
(u)  A decision of the mayor and city council shall be final and may be appealed only to a court of competent jurisdiction. Such appeal must be taken within thirty (30) days of the decision of the mayor and city council. Reconsideration of an appeal under court order shall follow the same procedures of this article as though a new application.

(Ord. No. 2003-24, § 6, 8-18-03) 
Sec. 8-16. - Procedure for collecting special assessments and ad valorem taxes. 
(a)  The city finance director shall cause a bill to be issued to each delivered to the last address shown for each taxpayer on the county tax digest. Failure on the part of the taxpayer to receive a bill shall not constitute grounds for late payment, or failure to pay the tax. The tax bill contemplated herein shall adequately describe the property subject to the tax and list its fair market value as assessed. The bill shall also state the millage rate as adopted and the amount of the tax due. The bill shall also state the date after which taxes shall be considered in default and subject to the collection measures as set forth in this section. 
(b)  Tax bills for property also subject to a special assessment levied by the city shall include, in addition to the information contained in subsection (a) above, a separate sum due as a result of the special assessment. Said tax bill shall further include an adequate description of the basis for said special assessment and the legal authority providing for same. 
(c)  At any time after the last day for the payment of taxes or special assessments have arrived, the city finance director shall cause written notice to be sent to each delinquent taxpayer, or delinquent property owner in the case of a special assessment, of the fact that payment for same is due in full immediately and that failure to pay said tax or special assessment shall result in the city finance director causing an execution to be issued for same and recorded on the county deed records. Upon expiration of thirty (30) days from the aforesaid notice, the city finance director shall issue executions for nonpayment of taxes or special assessments. The execution shall include the following information: 
(1)  The defendant in fi. fa. (the property owner); 
(2)  The year(s) of taxes or special assessments due for which the execution is to be issued; 
(3)  A description of the property sufficient to put interested parties on notice; and 
(4)  All amounts of money due, including the tax, applicable special assessments, penalties, execution costs, and interest. 
(d)  When a properly issued tax execution or special assessment is lost or destroyed, an alias tax execution or special assessment may be issued by the city finance director and such alias tax execution or special assessment shall have the same force and effect as the lost or destroyed original. 
(Ord. No. 91-3, § 3, 1-21-91; Ord. No. 93-32, § 2, 11-15-93; Ord. No. 2003-24, § 7, 8-18-03; Ord. No. 2005-31, § 2, 12-5-05) 
Sec. 8-17. - Levy of executions, sale of real and personal property to satisfy unpaid taxes and assessments. 
(a)  The city finance director shall cause all executions issued to be placed in the hands of the police chief for collection or levy and sale of the property. The police chief shall exercise his best efforts to collect the full amount of taxes and assessments due, together with all interest, penalties, and any costs due thereon, from the defendant in fi. fa. In the event the police chief is unable to do so, the police chief shall levy the execution on a sufficient amount of the defendant in fi. fa.'s property, whether real or personal, to satisfy the obligations due at a sale to be held and conducted in accordance with this section. 
(b)  The police chief is hereby designated as the marshal of the city and delegated the duties as set forth herein. The police chief shall be subject to being ruled for money in his hands arising from the public sale of any property pursuant to process issued by the municipality. After first paying the city finance director the amount due on the process under which the sale was made, the marshal shall pay any surplus, should such exist, to any lawful claimant holding an interest subordinate to the lien for taxes. Should there still exist a surplus after all subordinate claims are satisfied, the remainder shall be paid over to the defendant in fi. fa. 
(c)  Whenever any real property is levied upon for taxes or assessments, it shall be the marshal's duty before proceeding to advertise the property for sale to give twenty (20) days' written notice of the levy to the record owner(s) of the property and to the holder of each secured interest holder of record. The twenty-day period shall begin to run from the time the notice is personally delivered or, when delivered by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, from the date of mailing. The notice shall contain a description of the land levied upon, the name of the owner(s) of the land, the year(s) for which the taxes were assessed, and a statement of the amount of the taxes due, together with accrued costs. The marshal shall keep a copy of the notice on which he shall enter the date the notice was delivered or mailed and how, where, and to whom the notice was delivered. The marshal shall file the copy with the city finance director. 
(d)  Upon the passing of twenty (20) days after the notice contemplated in subsection (c) of this section has been delivered, the marshal shall publish weekly for four (4) weeks in the official legal organ of the county in which the sale will be conducted, an advertisement of the date, place, and hours during which the sale will be conducted, together with a full and complete description of the property to be sold, making known the names of the property owner(s) of record and any person who may be in possession of the property. The notice shall state the property is being sold for the collection of taxes and/or special assessments, when applicable, due to the city and the year(s) for which taxes and special assessments have been executed. 
(e)  When a levy is made on real property, the marshal shall give the defendant in fi. fa. an additional written notice of at least ten (10) days prior to the sale of said real property. The written notice shall be delivered by registered or certified U.S. mail, addressed to the taxpayer at the last known address listed in the records of the county commissioner. Notice is effective when deposited in the mail with adequate postage attached thereon. 
(f)  Sales of property under execution shall be made by the marshal in the chambers of the city hall on the first Tuesday in each month between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. at public outcry to the highest bidder for cash. Should the first Tuesday of the month, however, fall on New Year's Day or Independence Day, such sales shall take place on the immediately following Wednesday. The purchaser shall look for himself as to the title and soundness of all property sold under tax executions and neither the marshal conducting the sale, nor the city, make any representations or warranty of title, condition, or fitness for a particular purpose, expressed or implied. 
(g)  The marshal shall sell the property to the highest bidder for cash and, upon collection of the sales price, make a deed or bill of sale to the purchaser. Any person who becomes the purchaser of any property sold at the sale, who fails or refuses to comply with the terms of sale when requested by the marshal to do so, shall be liable for the amount of the purchase money. It shall be the option of the marshal either to proceed against the purchaser for the full amount of the purchase money or to resell the property and then proceed against the first purchaser for any deficiency. A tax deed for real property, or bill of sale for personal property, made and delivered as evidence of a sale for taxes conducted pursuant to this Code section shall convey the title as effectually as if the sale were made by the persona against whom the process was issued. Sales of personal property shall be final; real property sold by virtue of an execution issued for the collection of taxes or for any special assessments is subject to redemption rights of the defendant in fi. fa. or any person having any right, title, or interest in or lien upon such property at the time of levy or sale. Recitals in a deed or bill of sale under power of sale for taxes shall be prima facie evidence of the facts recited in the instrument. The marshal shall put the purchaser in possession of the property so sold; provide, however, the purchaser of real property is not entitled to be placed in possession until after the time for redemption has expired. 
(h)  In the event that no bids are forthcoming on property offered for public sale in accordance with this section, the marshal may either re-advertise and sell the property at a later date or abandon the property. The marshal shall make a proper notation on the execution whenever property levied upon and exposed for sale has been abandoned due to a lack of bids. 
(Ord. No. 2003-24, § 8, 8-18-03) 
Sec. 8-18. - Bidding by City of Powder Springs at tax sales. 
(a)  If, during any sale of property for taxes and/or special assessments, no one present at the sale bids an amount for the property being sold which is an amount equal to or greater than the taxes due (including any priority liens for taxes due the sate, county and school and other special tax districts of the state) plus the marshal's cost due on the sale, then the city manager, or his designee, may purchase the property for the city. If the city purchases property at a sale, the marshal shall make to the city a deed to the property sold and shall deliver the deed to the city manager. The marshal shall put the city in possession of the property so sold. 
(b)  Property acquired by the city pursuant to subsection (a) above may be divested or alienated by the city only by the public sale of the property to the highest bidder. However, when the city has not parted with title to the property, the city may quitclaim the property to the owner at the time of the tax sale, or to the owner's administrators, executors, heirs, or assigns, upon full payment of the redemption price provided herein. 
(Ord. No. 2003-24, § 9, 8-18-03)

(Ord. No. 2003-24, § 11, 8-18-03) 
Sec. 8-21. - Redemption rights of defendant infi. fa. 
    Whenever real property is sold for taxes or any special assessment, the defendant in fi. fa. or any person having any right, title, or interest in or lien upon such property may redeem the property from the sale by the payment of the redemption price or the amount required for redemption as fixed by O.C.G.A. § 48-4-42, at any time within twelve (12) months from the date of sale, and at any time after the sale until the right to redeem is foreclosed by the giving of the notice provided for in O.C.G.A. § 48-4-45, which code section by reference are incorporated herein. 
(Ord. No. 2003-24, § 12, 8-18-03) 
Sec. 8-22. - Costs. 
(a)  For issuing executions, the city shall receive only an amount equal to any filing fees charged by the clerk of the superior court for recording and canceling the tax fi. fa. 
(b)  Once a levy is made or posted on the property of a defendant in fi. fa. , in addition to all taxes, interest, penalties and cost heretofore accrued, the marshal shall collect a levy administration fee of five (5) percent of the taxes and/or assessments due, when applicable, or two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00), whichever is the lesser. However, no levy administration fee shall be less than fifty dollars ($50.00). 
(c)  In addition to the levy administration fees, after levy but prior to the sale, the marshal shall collect his actual cost for advertising the sale, postage and service fees actually incurred, and any attorney's fees incurred in examination of title to property, plus a commission for conducting the sale, not to exceed eight (8) percent on sums of fifty dollars ($50.00) or less, six (6) percent on sums above fifty dollars ($50.00) up to five hundred fifty dollars ($550.00), and three (3) percent on all sums exceeding five hundred fifty dollars ($550.00). 
(Ord. No. 2003-24, § 13, 8-18-03) 
Sec. 8-23. - Taxes constitute liens. 
    All ad valorem taxes and special assessments due to the city, including penalties, interest, costs and other charges thereon, shall constitute liens on the property of the taxpayer, as well as a personal debt of the taxpayer, in the same manner and to the same extent as liens for taxes, penalties, interest, costs and other charges thereon due to the county and state. Taxes due to the city shall accrue and bear the same penalties, interest, costs and other charges thereon as taxes due to the county and state. 
(Ord. No. 2003-24, § 14, 8-18-03) 
Sec. 8-24. - Effect of delinquencies on licenses. 
    Except as may be specifically set forth otherwise in the Code, the city may refuse to issue, extend or renew, and may revoke, any occupational tax permit and/or registration and any business license or licenses applied for or held by any person, firm or entity owing any amount to the city for delinquent city taxes, penalties, interest, costs or other charges thereon.

Sec. 8-25. - Homestead exemption. 
(a)  This section is passed pursuant to Article VII, Section II, Paragraph II of the Constitution of the State of Georgia of 1983, which authorizes the granting of homestead exemptions from ad valorem taxation levied by local taxing jurisdictions. 
(b)  Each resident of the city who is disabled is granted an exemption from all municipal ad valorem taxes in the amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) on a homestead owned and occupied by such resident as a residence if his or her net income, together with the net income of his or her spouse who also occupies and resides at such homestead, as net income is defined by Georgia law, from all sources does not exceed fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00) for the immediately preceding taxable year for income tax purposes. For the purposes of this section, net income shall include, without limitation, income received as retirement, survivor, or disability benefits under the federal Social Security Act or under any other public or private retirement, disability, or pension system. The value of the residence in excess of the above-exempted amount shall remain subject to taxation. In order to qualify for the exemption provided for in this section, the person claiming such exemption shall be required to obtain a certificate from not less than one (1) nor more than three (3) physicians licensed to practice medicine under O.C.G.A. Chapter 34 of Title 43 certifying that such person is mentally or physically incapacitated to the extent that such person is unable to be gainfully employed and that such incapacity is likely to be permanent. Any such person shall not receive the benefits of such homestead exemption unless such person or his or her agent provides the tax commissioner of Cobb County with the certificates provided for in this section and files an application with such tax commissioner giving the amount of income which such person and his or her spouse received during the last taxable year for income tax purposes and such additional information relative to receiving the benefits of such exemption as will enable the tax commissioner to make a determination as to whether such person is entitled to such exemption. The tax commissioner shall provide the necessary forms for this purpose. Such applications shall be processed in the same manner as other applications for a homestead exemption, and the provisions of law applicable to the processing of homestead exemptions, as the same now exist or may hereafter be amended, shall apply thereto, but after any such person has filed the proper application and certificates, as provided above, and has been allowed the exemption provided in this section, it shall not be necessary that he or she make application and file such certificates thereafter for any year and such exemption shall continue to be allowed to such person. It shall be the duty of any such person, however, to notify the tax commissioner in the event he or she becomes ineligible for any reason for the exemption provided in this section. The increased exemption provided for in this section shall apply to all taxable years beginning after December 31, 1992. 
(c)  The exemption granted by subsection (b) of this section shall be in lieu of and not in addition to any exemption from Powder Springs municipal ad valorem taxes which is lower in amount for any taxable year and which is granted by the constitution or laws of this state. If the amount of any other exemption applicable to any resident is greater than or is increased to an amount greater than the amount of the exemption granted by subsection (b) of this section then such exemption shall apply rather than the exemption granted by subsection (b) of this section. 
(d)  The exemption granted by subsection (b) of this section shall not apply to or affect any taxes levied on behalf of Cobb County, the Cobb County School System, or state taxes, nor shall it affect or supersede any existing homestead exemption from Cobb County or Cobb County School System ad valorem taxes.

ARTICLE IX. - STORMWATER UTILITY 

Sec. 11-200. - Findings. 
    The City of Powder Springs Mayor and city council make the following findings of fact: 
(a)  Powder Springs is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraph III thereof and O.C.G.A. § 36-82-62 to provide stormwater management services throughout Powder Springs. 
(b)  The federal Clean Water Act, as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.), and the rules and regulations promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant thereto emphasize the role of local governments in developing, implementing, conducting and funding stormwater programs that address water quality impacts of stormwater runoff. 
(c)  The city is required under federal and state regulations [i.e. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Phase I Stormwater Permit under which the city operates] to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality to mitigate the impacts of pollutants which may be discharged from the public municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) and stormwater conveyance system into State of Georgia or United States' waters. 
(d)  Compliance with the regulatory obligations of the NPDES Phase I Stormwater Permit, Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District and other city stormwater program activities will affect the cost of providing stormwater management services above what is currently being spent for water quality management, drainage system maintenance, flood control and other program activities. 
(e)  Stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities contribute to the protection of surface water quality in area water bodies, reduce the likelihood of infiltration and inflow of stormwaters into the sanitary sewer system to protect operations of such system, and lessen erosion, water damage to property and impairment of water bodies, thereby assisting the city in meeting the regulatory obligations imposed by its NPDES permit. 
(f)  A system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the city. 
(g)  The city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities, which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city, and the additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city. In order to do so, the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for its comprehensive program operation and drainage-related capital improvement needs. 
(h)  Stormwater management services and systems and facilities are needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point of time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the incorporated areas of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
(i)  The cost of providing stormwater management services and operating and maintaining stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system. 
(j)  The city has undertaken a comprehensive review by an oversight committee of city residents and businesses, professional scientific consultants and staff to assess and define the city's stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities as well as the stormwater management program funding strategy. 
(k)  Given the stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned professional review, the city finds that a stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly providing stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities, and a stormwater service fee provides the most practical and appropriate means of funding stormwater management services in the city. 
(l)  A schedule of stormwater utility service fees based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city. Such service fee may be complemented by other types of fees which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, revenue bonds, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council. 
(m)  The area of impervious surfaces on each improved property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services provided or to be provided by the city, and the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater service fee. 
(n)  The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site or off-site systems, facilities, activities or assets which reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities, should be taken into account to reduce the service fee on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or credit and such reduction or credit should be conditional upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes. The stormwater service fee credit shall be determined based on technical requirements and standards contained in the Stormwater Utility Service Fee Credit Manual in its most current edition. 
(o)  It is imperative that the proceeds from the stormwater utility service fees, together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and such proceeds should therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund and remain in that fund except for disbursement for stormwater management capital, operating and non-operating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes. 
(Ord. No. 2011-05, § 1, 6-6-11) 
Sec. 11-201. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Act means and refers to the Clean Water Act as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.), as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant thereto. 
    City standards mean the city ordinances that govern water quality and water quantity, including the development regulations, floodplain management ordinance, soil erosion and sediment control ordinance, illicit discharge and illegal connection ordinance, stream buffer protection, zoning stipulations, stormwater design manual and all procedures, rules and policies pertaining thereto as these may be updated or amended from time to time. 
    Credit means a conditional reduction allowed in the amount of a stormwater service fee to the owner of a property for the existence and use of privately owned, maintained and operated on-site or off-site stormwater systems or facilities, or continuing provision of services or activities that reduce or mitigate the city's cost of providing stormwater management services for that particular property based upon the design and performance standards in the city's Stormwater Utility Service Fee Credit Manual, to be adopted pursuant to this article, as it may be updated or amended from time to time. 
    ERU means equivalent residential unit, which is the average of the total square footage of the impervious surface area of improved single-family residential properties in the city, as determined by the city, and used as the basis for determining stormwater services fees to other properties. Two thousand eight hundred and forty square feet (2,840 sf) of impervious surface shall be the equivalent of one unit. 
    Hydrologic response defines the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. Hydrologic response is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious surface and the parcel's size, shape, vegetative canopy, and its groundwater, antecedent moisture and geologic conditions. 
    Impervious surface means those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil in the manner in which it entered the soil, in natural conditions, prior to development. Common impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, rooftops, buildings or structures, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings, and other surfaces which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to development. 
    Impervious surface area means the number of square feet of horizontal surface covered by buildings and other impervious surfaces. All building measurements shall be made between exterior walls, foundation, columns or other means of support or enclosure. 
    Improved property means property altered from its natural state by construction or installation of more than five hundred (500) square feet of impervious surfaces. 
    Public water influence zone means those areas lying downstream of a culvert, or other stormwater management conveyance system. On the downstream side of the conveyance system, the public water influence zone will extend for a length of six (6) times the diameter (or width) of the culvert from which runoff is being discharged, as established by the Field Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, Third Edition, pg. 99, and within the horizontal limits set forth in the aforementioned manual. For example, if a forty-eight-inch diameter culvert is discharging to a private property, the public water influence zone shall extend twenty-four (24) feet (6 times 48 inches) from the end of the culvert and for the specified width (i.e. typically the width of the creek). The Powder Springs Stormwater Utility may perform maintenance and/or capital construction activities only within that portion of the public water influence zone for which the city has an ownership interest or a dedicated easement granted to and accepted by the city for such purpose. 
    Service area means the entire land area within the corporate limits of the city. 
    Stormwater management services may address the quality and quantity of stormwater runoff and include all services provided by the city that relate to the: 
(1)  Transfer, control, conveyance or movement of stormwater runoff through the incorporated portions of the city; 
(2)  Maintenance, repair and replacement of existing stormwater management systems and facilities; 
(3)  Planning, development, design and construction of additional stormwater management systems and facilities; 
(4)  Regulation of the use of stormwater management services, controls, systems and facilities; 
(5)  Compliance with applicable state and federal stormwater management regulations and permit requirements; 
(6)  Education of the public about stormwater issues; 
(7)  Storm drain cleaning and repair, street sweeping and shoulder and ditch maintenance within the publicly owned right-of-way; 
(8)  Inspection and monitoring of water quantity or quality to require compliance with state or local standards and stormwater management programs; 
(9)  All other services related to the administration, management, maintenance, expansion, and improvement of the public stormwater management systems for the handling of stormwater runoff of private and public properties, and the regulation of the public and private stormwater management systems, controls, facilities, and activities, including the quality and quantity of runoff; and 
(10)  Management and administration of the stormwater utility service fee. 
    Stormwater management systems and facilities mean those natural and manmade channels, swales, ditches, rivers, streams, creeks, branches, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, inlets, catch basins, pipes, headwalls, storm sewers, lakes and other physical works, properties and improvements which transfer, control, convey, detain, retain, treat or otherwise influence the movement of stormwater runoff. 
    Stormwater utility means a fiscal entity funded by a stormwater service fee that provides stormwater management services, including infrastructure improvements. 
    Stormwater utility manager means the public works director or other person designated by the city manager. 
    Stormwater utility service fee means the service fee imposed by the stormwater utility to a parcel of improved property pursuant to this article that is based upon the amount of impervious surface area within each parcel or equivalent service units for providing stormwater management services and stormwater management systems and facilities. This term shall exclude special fees for development plan review, inspection of development projects, on-site stormwater control systems and other stormwater management services provided by the city for which a corresponding fee is collected for the service rendered. 
    Undeveloped land means land in its unaltered natural condition or which is modified to such a minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural condition. For purposes of this article, undeveloped land includes property altered from its natural condition by the creation or installation of five hundred (500) square feet or less of impervious surface. 
    User is defined as any person who owns property that maintains connection to, discharges to, or otherwise receives services from the city for stormwater management. 
    Water quality means the chemical, physical, and biological characteristics of the state's public waters. 
    Water quantity means the volume of runoff which is not entirely confined and retained completely upon a parcel. 
(Ord. No. 2011-05, § 1, 6-6-11) 
Sec. 11-202. - Stormwater utility and enterprise fund established. 
(a)  There is hereby established a stormwater utility which shall be responsible for stormwater management services throughout the incorporated areas of the city, and which shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of the city's stormwater management system and facilities. 
(b)  There is hereby established a stormwater utility enterprise fund in the city budgeting and accounting systems separate and apart from the general fund, for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the stormwater utility. The enterprise fund may include rates, charges, and fees as may be established by the city council from time to time, and other funds that may be transferred or allocated to the stormwater utility. Any revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be placed in the stormwater utility enterprise fund and shall be used solely for stormwater management services, including capital project construction. All expenses and capital investments of the stormwater utility shall be paid from the stormwater utility enterprise fund; provided, however, that other funds such as grants, loans, and bond proceeds may be applied to stormwater management services as deemed appropriate by the city. 
(c)  The stormwater utility manager shall be responsible for managing and implementing the stormwater management plan, stormwater management services and the stormwater utility and shall have operational control over the existing stormwater management system and facilities owned by the city as well as other related assets, including properties, other than road right-of-way, upon which such stormwater management systems and facilities are located, easements, rights-of-entry and access and certain equipment used for stormwater management. 
(Ord. No. 2011-05, § 1, 6-6-11)

(a)  The stormwater utility shall provide stormwater management services for existing and proposed stormwater management systems and facilities, subject to funding availability and policy determinations made in the best interest of public health, welfare and safety. The stormwater utility may accept the responsibility for providing stormwater management services to private stormwater management systems and facilities, subject to approval by the city. 
(b)  The city owns, or has rights established by written agreements that allow the stormwater utility to provide stormwater management services and access, operate, maintain, and improve, stormwater management systems and facilities located: 
(1)  Within public road rights-of-way; 
(2)  On private property subject to easements, rights of entry, rights of access, rights of use or other permanent provisions for operation, maintenance, improvement and access to the stormwater management system facilities located thereon; 
(3)  On private property but within a public water influence zone after securing a right of entry, right of access, permanent easement, temporary easement or other form of written consent from the property owner; 
(4)  On land dedicated to and accepted by the city solely for the operation, maintenance, improvement and access to the stormwater management systems and facilities located thereon; or, 
(5)  On public land owned by the city or another governmental entity for which the city has agreements providing for the operation, maintenance, improvement and access to the stormwater management systems and facilities located thereon. 
(c)  The operation, maintenance or improvement of stormwater management systems and facilities located on private or public property not owned by the city, and for which there has been no written agreement granting easements, rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use or other form of dedication thereof to the city for operation, maintenance, improvement and access of such stormwater management systems and facilities shall be and remain the legal responsibility of the property owner, except as otherwise provided for by the state and federal laws and regulations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, should the owner of stormwater management systems and facilities fail to maintain such stormwater management systems and facilities, the city may perform such maintenance as is necessary in the public interest to keep the systems and facilities functional. In the case of residential subdivisions where title has not been assumed by the homeowner's association, or if there is no homeowner's association in existence, or when there is a homeowner's association which has title to the stormwater management systems and facilities but has failed to adequately maintain, the cost of the city's maintenance activities shall be assessed against the properties served by the structure as a special assessment. The city may place reasonable conditions upon such work, such as requiring temporary or permanent access and maintenance easements. 
(d)  It is the express intent of this article to protect the public health, safety and general welfare of all persons and properties in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with any individual person, or to any specific property within or outside the boundaries of the city. The city expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages or equitable remedies upon the city, its elected officials, officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship. 
(e)  If any permit, plan approval, inspection or similar act is required by the city as a condition precedent to any activity or change upon property not owned by the city pursuant to this or any other regulatory ordinance, regulation or rule of the city, or under federal or state law, the issuance of such permit, plan approval or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a warranty, express or implied, nor shall it afford the basis for any action, including any action based on failure to permit, negligent issuance of a permit, negligent plan approval, or negligent maintenance of any permitted stormwater management system or facility not expressly dedicated to and accepted by the city for further maintenance in an action seeking the imposition of money damages or equitable remedies against the city, its commissioners, officers, employees or agents.

Sec. 11-204. - Stormwater service fee. 
(a)  It shall be the policy of the city that fees for stormwater management services to be provided by the stormwater utility in the designated service areas shall be equitably derived through methods which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management services by individual properties and/or the level of service rendered by, or resulting from, the provision of stormwater management services. Stormwater service fee rates shall be structured so as to be uniform within the customer class, and the resultant service fees shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing stormwater management services. Service fee rates shall be in addition to other rates, charges, or fees employed for stormwater management within the incorporated areas of the city, including, but not limited to, plan review and inspection fees, fees for special services, fees in lieu of regulatory requirements, system development fees and special assessments.

(a)  Stormwater service fee rates shall be set and may be modified from time to time by resolution of the mayor and city council. A schedule of said rates shall be on file in the office of the city clerk of the City of Powder Springs. In setting or modifying such rates it shall be the goal of the city to establish rates that are fair and reasonable, and together with other sources of support that may be available to the stormwater utility, are sufficient to support the cost of the stormwater management services, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, lease payments, operating expenses, capital outlays, non-operating expenses, provisions for prudent reserves and other costs as deemed appropriate by the city. 
(b)  The basis for calculation of the stormwater service fee on all improved properties shall be the ERU for impervious surface. Each residential property shall pay the equivalent of one (1) ERU per month. Each nonresidential property shall pay one (1) ERU for each two thousand eight hundred forty (2,840) square feet or increment thereof of impervious surface located on the property to establish the total number of ERU's for billing, with a minimum number of ERU's being one (1). Fractional ERU's will be calculated to six (6) decimals. 
(c)  Stormwater service fee revenues in any given year may exceed or be less than the cost of service in that year, provided, however, that the stormwater service fee rate shall be based on meeting the long-term projected cost of stormwater management programs, services, systems and facilities. All unencumbered stormwater management funds derived from service fees and other sources of revenue not expended at the end of a fiscal year shall remain in the stormwater management utility enterprise fund account and balances shall be forwarded to the next fiscal year.

1.  Parcels which contain less than five hundred (500) square feet of impervious surfaces. 
2.  Railroad tracks. 
3.  Any property whereby one hundred (100) percent of the stormwater runoff is contained or infiltrated on the property and no stormwater runoff is discharged, via overland flow or manmade conveyance, to adjacent properties or rights-of-way for all storm events up to and including the 100-year 24-hour storm event, as established to the satisfaction of the stormwater utility manager.

Copies of the manual shall be maintained by and available from the stormwater utility manager. 
(b)  Any credit allowed against the stormwater service fee is conditioned on continuing compliance with the city's design and performance standards as stated in the manual.

(f)  At no time shall a credit reduce the amount charged to less than one (1) ERU. 
(Ord. No. 2011-05, § 1, 6-6-11) 
Sec. 11-208. - Stormwater service fee billing delinquencies and collections. 
(a)  A stormwater service fee bill may be sent through the United Stated mail or by alternative means notifying the customer of the amount of the bill, the date the payment is due, and the date when past due. Failure to receive a bill is not justification for non-payment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each parcel of developed land shall be ultimately obligated to pay such fee. The stormwater service fee will be billed and collected as deemed most effective and efficient by the city manager. If a customer is under billed or if no bill is sent for a particular tract of improved property, the stormwater utility may back bill for a period of up to one (1) year. 
(b)  Unpaid stormwater service fees shall be collected by filing suit to collect on an unpaid account and by using all methods allowed by state law to collect on any judgment obtained thereby, including enforcement of any lien resulting from any such judgment.

(8)  The manager or designee may determine inspection schedules necessary to enforce the provisions of this article. 
(c)  Any failure to meet the obligations set forth in this section shall constitute a violation of this article and be subject to citation and prosecution in the Powder Springs Municipal Court. Each day such violation exists shall constitute a separate offense, subject to the penalties allowed by law. 
(d)  Alternatively, in the event a public nuisance is deemed to exist by the stormwater utility manager, the city may elect to sue in the Powder Springs Municipal Court to abate such nuisance. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the property owner fails to abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the Powder Springs Municipal Court, the city may enter upon the property and cause work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, and the actual cost thereof shall become a special assessment upon said property, which special assessment may be enforced and collected in accordance with section 8-16 et seq. of this Code.

(3)  Notice of suspension or revocation proceedings shall be served on the person named as licensee in the application. Notice shall be in writing. The notice may be served personally or by first class mail. If by mail, the notice shall be addressed to the licensee at its address as provided by the licensee to the municipality.

(4)  The hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer appointed by the mayor of the city council. The hearing officer shall be an attorney licensed to practice in the state who is disinterested in the proceeding. 
(5)  Hearings shall be only as formal as necessary to preserve order and shall be compatible with the principles of justice. The city attorney shall present the city's case and bear the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that due cause exists to suspend or revoke the license. At the hearing the licensee shall have the right to represent itself or be represented by counsel, may cross examine all witnesses offered by the city, and may call witnesses and present evidence in its own behalf. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings under this section, although the hearing officer shall have the right to exclude evidence which carries no indicia of reliability. All testimony shall be offered under oath or affirmation. 
(6)  The hearing officer shall make his final determination within ten (10) business days of the completion of the hearing. The decision shall be placed in writing and contain the hearing officer's findings of fact, conclusions of law, and decision as to sanction, if any. Such sanction may include one (1) or more of the following: revocation of the license, suspension of the license for no more than twelve (12) months, imposition of a probationary period not to exceed twelve (12) months, and/or a civil monetary penalty not to exceed the amount allowed under the city charter. Progressive sanctions, depending on the severity of the violation, are encouraged but not required. Where the remaining term of the license is less than twelve (12) months, imposition of suspension or probation for a period in excess of the term of the existing license shall be applied to any renewal license. A subsequent violation within a probationary period shall be cause for revocation and/or denial of license renewal. A total of three (3) separate and unrelated violations within twenty-four (24) months, whether or not within a probationary period, shall be grounds for permanent revocation. 
(7)  The hearing officer's decision shall be personally served or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested to the licensee and his attorney, with a copy to the city attorney, within ten (10) business days of the close of the hearing. The decision of the hearing officer shall constitute final action by the city, subject to review upon petition for certiorari to the superior court. 
(8)  Upon receipt of notice of adverse action against the licensee under this section, the licensee may waive its right to a hearing and stipulate to a sanction, as recommended by the city manager, in consultation with the chief of police. Any stipulation entered under this subsection shall be in writing, signed by the licensee, and non-appealable.

ARTICLE XIII. - LAWYERS AND LAW FIRMS 

Sec. 12-350. - Scope and levy. 
(a)  It is the intent of the city that the tax imposed in this section is for revenue purposes only. The city expressly acknowledges that it cannot regulate the practice of law, and no portion of this article shall be construed in such a manner as to constitute the regulation of the practice of law. The city further expressly recognizes that the regulation of the practice of law is the exclusive province of the state supreme court and its authorized representatives. Further, it is not the intent of this section to impose any precondition upon the practice of law. In keeping with these principles, and pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-13-6 et seq., all persons, including professional corporations, engaged in the practice of law in the city are hereby required to pay the amount now or hereafter fixed as the occupation tax thereon. 
(b)  Persons practicing law in the city but not maintaining an office in the city. 
(1)  The provisions of this article shall apply to those persons practicing law with no location or office in the city if the person: 
a.  Has one (1) or more employees or agents who exert substantial efforts within the city for the purpose of soliciting business or serving clients; or 
b.  Owns personal or real property which generates income related to the practice of law and which is located in the city.

(3)  If a person subject to this subsection provides to the business registration division proof of payment of a local business or occupation tax in another state, or county or municipality of this state which purports to tax the practitioner's services in this state, the practitioner shall be exempt for the levy of any occupational tax under this section.

(d)  A refusal to submit a notarized affidavit or other written information stating whether a person engages in the practice of law at a particular location or stating the dates of operation at a location shall not be a violation of this article and shall not prevent an attorney from practicing law in the city.

Rather, the occupation tax for the preceding calendar year shall be due January 1 of the following year and payable without interest accrued until February 1 at which time the tax will be delinquent and accrue interest. The tax may be paid in person at the business registration division or by mailing the tax to the business registration division. Any tax payment made by mail shall include the name and address of the person or law firm paying the tax and the name of each attorney whose tax is being paid, so that the business registration division may process the payment.

(d)  The schedules of fees shall be as approved and adopted and as may be amended in the future by the city council.

Sec. 12-362. - Option of the business registration division manager to send bills. 
(a)  Notwithstanding any language to the contrary elsewhere in this article, the business registration division manager may choose to send bills to attorneys who list their address with the state bar as being located in the city. 
(b)  An attorney who prepares and signs a notarized affidavit that they did not practice law within the jurisdiction of the city during some part of the tax year for which the tax bill was generated may have their bill adjusted for the time period stated in the affidavit when such attorney did not maintain an office within the jurisdiction of the city and/or states such other reasons why the occupation tax should be adjusted. Such adjustment shall not be made for those attorneys who elect to pay the four hundred dollars ($400.00) per practitioner fee unless the affidavit states that the attorney did not practice law in the jurisdiction of the city at any time during the year for which the tax bill was generated. The business registration division manager is authorized to inquire whether such affidavit matches the information maintained by the state bar in connection with the directives of State Bar Rule 1-207 and/or to take such other steps as deemed necessary to determine the accuracy of the affidavit. The submission of an affidavit requesting adjustment shall not act to prevent the imposition of interest should the business registration division manager deny the request for adjustment.

(d)  The business registration division manager may include in any bills, the unpaid tax balance from three (3) other years, including all fees and penalties and the amount of interest, which has accrued on any unpaid tax liability. The failure of the business registration division manager to list any unpaid balance on any bill shall not operate to relieve the taxpayer from liability for any balance due. 
(e)  It shall be a violation of this section for any attorney to willfully and intentionally misrepresent a material fact in an affidavit to avoid the payment of the occupation tax, and the sole enforcement action to be taken is set forth as follows: 
(1)  When the business registration division manager has reason to believe that an attorney has willfully and intentionally misrepresented a material fact in any affidavit submitted to business registration division for the purposes of avoiding full payment of the occupation tax, he or she shall consult with the city attorney to determine whether such conduct should be referred to the state bar for investigation as to whether a violation of the state rules of professional conduct has occurred.

Further proceedings concerning the execution procedure employed in the enforcement of this section shall be as provided by state law. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, the use of tax executions and the reporting of any alleged misrepresentations shall be the sole mechanism for enforcement of the occupation tax levy against attorneys, and neither this article nor any other portion of the ordinances of the city authorize any civil fine or associated contempt charges for failure to comply with this article.

The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the interested parties; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. 
(d)  Time of hearing. The summons shall notify the interested parties that a hearing will be held before a court of competent jurisdiction at a date and time certain. Such hearing shall be held not less than fifteen (15) days nor more than forty-five (45) days after the filing of said complaint. 
(e)  Right to be heard. The interested parties shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for the hearing. 
(f)  Order. If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question meets one or more of the standards enumerated in subsection (b) so as to constitute a public nuisance, the court shall state in writing findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order which does one of the following: 
(1)  If the repair of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to its present value, the order shall require the owner, within a specified time, to repair such property so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation and, if applicable, to effect a closing of any structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
(2)  If the repair of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into full compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value thereof, the order shall require the owner, within a specified time, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. 
For purposes of this section, the court shall make its determination of "reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure" without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair a structure may be considered. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. Title 43, Chapter 39A, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations. 
(g)  Remedies of public officer in the event of noncompliance with order. 
(1)  The order entered under subsection (f) shall further provide that, if the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure within the specified time, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished. Such abatement action shall commence within two hundred seventy (270) days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the two hundred seventy (270) days in which such abatement action must commence. 
(2)  If the public officer chooses to have the work done as ordered on any dwelling building or structure, he or she shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful. 
(h)  Salvage. If the public officer has a structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. Neither the public officer nor the city shall have any liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
(i)  Lien for costs. The order shall provide that the amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the city finance director, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. Such costs shall include but not be limited to the cost of demolition, reasonable attorneys' fees and all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the tax commissioner, restoration to grade of the real property should it be demolished, and title examination costs. Such lien shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition, in the office of the clerk of superior court, and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under subsection 21-7(b). The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. Such lien should cross reference the order and include the original caption and case number from the nuisance abatement action. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid in full. 
(j)  Enforcement of lien. 
(1)  Upon a final determination of costs, fees, and expenses incurred in accordance with this chapter, the public officer shall transmit to the city finance director a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notices provided to interested parties. The statement of the public officer shall be transmitted within ninety (90) days of completion of the repairs, demolition, or closure. It shall be the duty of the city finance director to collect the amount of the lien using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. Title 48, Chapter 4; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires twelve (12) months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. The city finance director shall remit the amount collected to the city. 
(2)  Enforcement of liens may be initiated at any time following receipt by the city finance director of the final determination of costs. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this chapter. 
(3)  The redemption amount in any enforcement proceeding shall be the full amount of the costs as finally determined with interest, penalties, and costs incurred by the city and the city finance director in the enforcement of the lien. Redemption of the property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-40 and 48-4-81. 
(k)  Waiver of lien. The mayor and council may waive and release any such lien imposed on property of the owner for costs incurred by the city up to the time of the entry of the order and any additional costs incurred subsequent thereto in attempting to bring the property into compliance by entering into a contract with the owner in which the owner agrees to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrates the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
(l)  Appellate procedure. Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a property shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29. 
(m)  Alternate remedies. Nothing in this section shall be construed as to limit or impair the authority of public officers or other city employees under existing and future ordinances to issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and to seek to enforce such citations in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this Code section.

Division I. Title, Authority, Purposes and Applicability.
Sec. 1-1. Title.
This ordinance shall be known as and may be cited as the unified development code of Powder Springs, Georgia.
Sec. 1-2. Authority.
(a) This unified development code is adopted under authority of article 9, section 2, paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Constitution of the State of Georgia, and pursuant to the Zoning Procedures Law (O.C.G.A. 36-66-1 et seq.) and other applicable laws enacted by the General Assembly, as well as the Charter of the City of Powder Springs, Georgia.
(b) The Georgia General Assembly has enacted the Georgia Planning Act of 1989, (Georgia Laws, 1989, pp. 1317-1391, Act 634) which among other things provides for local governments to adopt plans and regulations to implement plans for the protection and preservation of natural resources, the environment, vital areas, and land use.
(c) The Georgia Department of Community Affairs has promulgated Minimum Standards and Procedures for Local Comprehensive Planning (Chapter 110-3-2 of Rules of the Georgia
Article 1, General Provisions, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
3
Department of Community Affairs) to implement the Georgia Planning Act of 1989, said standards and procedures were ratified by the Georgia General Assembly, and have since been amended, and said rules require local governments to describe regulatory measures and land development regulations needed to implement local Comprehensive Plans.
(d) The Georgia Department of Natural Resources has promulgated Rules for Environmental Planning Criteria, commonly known as the Part V Standards, said rules were ratified by the Georgia General Assembly, and said rules require local governments to plan for the protection of the natural resources, the environment, and vital areas of the State.
(e) The Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District is authorized to develop and has developed regional and watershed-specific plans for storm-water management, waste-water treatment, water supply, water conservation, and the general protection of water quality, and such plans are required pursuant to Georgia Code Section 12-5-572 to be implemented by local governments in the district. Local governments are required to implement said plans by Georgia Code Sections 12-5-582 and 12-5-583, and failure to do so means that the local government shall be ineligible for state grants or loans for water supply and conservation projects determined by the Director of the Environmental Protection Division to be inconsistent with such plans. Said district pursuant to state law has prepared model ordinances for local governments to follow.
(f) Pursuant to the Municipal Home Rule Act of 1965 (Georgia Code Section 36-35-3) the governing authority of each municipal corporation shall have legislative power to adopt clearly reasonable ordinances, resolutions, or regulations relating to its property, affairs, and local government for which no provision has been made by general law and which are not inconsistent with the Constitution or any charter provision applicable thereto.
(g) Pursuant to Georgia Code Section 36-65-1, it is declared by the General Assembly of Georgia that in the exercise of powers specifically granted to them by law, local governing authorities of cities and counties are acting pursuant to state policy.
Sec. 1-3. Purposes.
The city has adopted a comprehensive plan in accordance with the requirements of the Georgia Planning Act of 1989, Rules of the Georgia Department of Community Affairs, and Rules of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, and said plan has been revised from time to time. The unified development code helps assure the implementation of the adopted comprehensive plan.
This unified development code is needed and intended to: promote the health, safety, welfare, morals, convenience, order, and prosperity of the citizens of the city; promote responsible growth, lessen congestion in the public thoroughfares, secure safety from fire and health dangers, and promote desirable living conditions; regulate the distribution and density of uses on the land to avoid both the undue concentration of population and the inappropriate dispersion of population; maintain the integrity and individual character of established communities and settlements, and promote desired character in new developments; prevent the encroachment of incompatible land uses within residential areas and preserve property values; and provide for economically sound and
Article 1, General Provisions, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
4
stable land development by assuring the provision in land developments of adequate streets, utilities, services, traffic access and circulation, public open spaces, and maintenance continuity.
This unified development code is also intended to serve the several purposes articulated in different articles of this code.
Sec. 1-4. Jurisdiction.
This unified development code applies to all lands within the incorporated areas of the City of Powder Springs, Georgia, as now exists or as hereafter lawfully established.
Sec. 1-5. Applicability.
No building, structure, device or land or water shall hereafter be used or occupied, erected, located, extended, established, moved, converted, or structurally altered except in full compliance with the provisions of this unified development code.
Sec. 1-6. Minimum Requirements.
Within each zoning district established by this development code, the regulations set forth shall be minimum requirements and shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of building, structure or land, except as may be altered through conditions of zoning applied to specific properties.
Sec. 1-7. Definitions.
Definitions are provided throughout the articles of this development code. This section provides definitions primarily related to zoning lots and dimensional regulations for buildings.
Abutting: Having property lines in common, or having property separated by only an alley. Separation by a street right-of-way is not considered abutting.
Buildable area of lot: The portion of a lot which is not located within any minimum required yard, landscape strip, landscaped area, buffer, or natural undisturbed buffer; that portion of a lot wherein a building or structure may be lawfully placed.
Building: Any structure having a roof supported by columns or walls and intended for the shelter, housing, or enclosure of any individual, animal, process, equipment, goods, or materials of any kind.
Building coverage: The horizontal area measured within the outside of the exterior walls of the ground floor (i.e., footprint) of all principal buildings, accessory buildings, and accessory structures on the lot, not including steps, terraces, and uncovered porches.
Building coverage, maximum: The percentage of a given lot that may be lawfully occupied by all principal and accessory buildings and structures on said lot, measured within the outside of the
Article 1, General Provisions, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
5
exterior walls of the ground floor (i.e., footprint) of all principal and accessory buildings and structures on the lot, not including steps, terraces, and uncovered porches.
Building floor area: The total floor area of all heated spaces within a building as measured within the outside of the exterior walls, exclusive of uncovered porches, terraces, and unheated stairwells, storage areas, garages and loading docks.
Building height: The vertical distance measured to the highest point of a building from the average finished grade across those sides of a building that face a street.
Building setback line: A line delineating the minimum allowable distance between a property line or the right-of-way line of an abutting street and a building on a lot. Building setbacks established by zoning district in this development code apply to principal buildings.

It is the intent of this section to require the complete correction of nonconforming situations at the time of any building addition or significant modification of a use or development on a given parcel of land, if such nonconforming situation can physically be made to comply with the requirements of this unified development code. It is the intent of this section to require the reduction in the extent of nonconforming situations at the
Article 1, General Provisions, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
15
time of any building addition or significant modification of a use or development on a given parcel of land, if such nonconforming situation cannot be physically be made to comply entirely with the requirements of this development code. It is the intent of this section to provide authority to the community development director to administer the provisions of this section in a manner that meets these intentions, and that the community development director shall exercise that authority, subject to more specific guidance as provided in this section.
(b) Definition. For purposes of this section, nonconforming situation shall mean any development, land improvement, or activity, not otherwise included within the definition of nonconforming lot, nonconforming building or structure, or nonconforming use, which does not meet the provisions of this development code at the time of its adoption or amendment. Examples of nonconforming situations include but are not limited to, noncompliance with off-street parking regulations, access requirements, failure to adhere to landscape strip requirements, tree protection, signs not meeting height or area restrictions, and insufficient landscaping.
(c) Determination of nonconforming situations. For any proposed building or development, or modification of a building or development, it shall be the duty of the community development director to identify the extent to which the improvements on land on which the building or development is proposed constitutes a nonconforming situation, as defined in this section. The community development director shall conduct a review and identify such nonconforming situation(s) at the time plans for such proposed building or development are submitted for review, and at any earlier opportunity, if presented. In the event that one or more nonconforming situations are found to exist by the community development director, they shall be documented and notice of the need to correct or reduce said nonconforming situations shall be provided by the community development director to the building or development applicant.
Sec. 1-70. Correction of Nonconforming Situations.
In determining the need to completely correct or reduce the noncompliance of nonconforming situations, the community development director shall be guided by the following standards:
(a) Strict compliance. A standard of strict compliance (complete correction of all nonconforming situations) shall be applied by the community development director where physical standards can clearly be made in the subject development proposal without significant alteration of the development as proposed.
(b) Reasonable progress toward compliance. In lieu of strict compliance, a standard of reasonable progress toward compliance shall be applied by the community development director in cases where complete correction or compliance with the nonconforming situation would require undue hardship, practical difficulty, or might unreasonably reduce the size, scale, or other significant aspect of the development proposal to a point where strict compliance would jeopardize the building or development proposal. In applying a standard of reasonable progress toward compliance, the
Article 1, General Provisions, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
16
community development director shall have authority to approve the building, development, or improvement even though it does not meet a standard of strict compliance, if the relief granted is the minimum necessary to effectuate the building, development, or improvement.
(c) Proportionality. Whenever something less than strict compliance is authorized by the community development director, in determining the amount or extent of compliance required, the director shall apply a standard of proportionality, meaning that the scope, scale, extent, and cost of requirements to correct nonconforming situations are more or less the same as the scope, scale, extent and cost of the improvement or development proposed.
Determinations by the community development director pursuant to this section may be appealed as an administrative decision under the provisions of this development code relating to appeals.

Section 2-15. PUD-R, Planned Unit Development- Residential
(a) Purpose
The PUD-R district is intended to allow flexible site planning and building arrangements under a unified plan of development so that innovative land planning methods may be utilized which foster natural resource conservation and neighborhood cohesiveness as well as neo-traditional developments. This may permit buildings to be clustered or arranged in an unconventional manner to maximize open space, create a pedestrian scale and other public benefits. In this district smaller lots than might otherwise be permitted under traditional zoning districts may be allowed; however, the purpose is not merely to allow smaller lots or reduce development requirements but to achieve other goals including the protection of sensitive environmental, historic, or aesthetic resources as well as the provision of site amenities such as parks, open space, walking trails, etc. The PUD-R district is intended to encourage greater density of development, and to encourage ingenuity and resourcefulness in land planning techniques which result in quality residential patterns that conserve and create open space, reduce vehicle trips and provide stable developments which enhance the surrounding area.
(b) PUD-R is intended for single-family detached dwellings and, single-family attached, fee-simple townhouse.
(c) The building setback abutting any zoning district must be 35 feet along the perimeter of the site.
(d) The minimum landscape buffer width abutting any zoning district shall be 25 feet for the entire perimeter of the site.
(e) All residential units shall have two-car garages, and the parking pads/driveway in front of the garage shall be a minimum of 22 feet in length in order to accommodate two additional cars, without encroaching on the sidewalk. The garages shall be used for the parking and storage of vehicles and may not be enclosed to provide for additional residential space.
(f) A recreation area shall be provided at a ratio of 1 acre per 50 units (or a proportional percentage thereof) with a minimum of 10,000 square feet provided. Such area shall be developed with at least one recreational feature, such as a walking trail, pavilion, gazebo, picnic area, swimming pool, playground or tennis courts. Recreational areas must be outside of any floodplain area. Any recreation area must be located in an area with a slope of less than 15%; however, all recreation areas or applicable green space
Article 2, Zoning Districts and Official Zoning Map, City of Powder Springs Unified Development Code
25
must meet ADA requirements for accessibility.
(g) Accessory structure may not be closer to any right-of-way or property lines than the principal building. In case or corner lots, the accessory structure may not be closer to any right-of-way than the principal building. No accessory structure may exceed the more restrictive of either 15 feet or the height of the principal building.
(h) Materials to be used on exterior facades of all buildings shall include no less than 50% brick or stone, on the front and side facades. If the rear of the building faces the main right-of-way, 50% brick on the rear façade that is visible to the main road will be required. All other building materials must be consistent with the architectural standards outlined in this Code.
(i) A 10 foot wide front landscape strip is required along the frontage of the development. One canopy tree shall be planted along every street frontage at a quantity equal to one tree per 40 feet of property frontage. This 10 foot strip must also include evergreen trees and shrubs. Trees Buffer Landscaping, Section 12 of the Unified Development Code is applicable to development within the PUD-R district.
(j) All PUD-R developments shall be zoned and subject to site specific plans and is still subject to applicable requirements of the Unified Development Code.
(k) The PUD-R allows for flexibility in design therefore, as part of the rezoning application, all provisions of the Unified Development Code that cannot be met as part of the development must be specifically identified in the rezoning application. Only uses permitted in Table 2-1 will be allowed within the PUD-R zoning district. After approval of the PUD-R, no other variance may be requested. Any modification to the PUD-R after approval must be considered as a change in zoning, unless identified as a minor site plan revision as defined in Section 13-54. In the case, of any conflict between the approved site plan and this Unified Development Code identified after approval of the PUD-R, the more restrictive approach will govern, unless the provision in question was specifically approved under the rezoning application described above.
(l) If development does not have lots, the units must meet the required square footage outlined for the PUD-R zoning district.
(m) A detailed site plan will be required with application and should include the following:
i. The location and extent of public rights-of-way, easements and water and drainage courses bounding and within the tract included in the general plan by reference to a plan or drawing.
ii. Minimum standards for lot development (setbacks, lot size).
iii. Open space and recreation area provisions (active and passive).
iv. Detailed landscaping plan.
v. Detailed architectural elevations of the proposed buildings.

Division III. Mixed-Use and Nonresidential Zoning Districts.
Sec. 2-21. MXU, Mixed-Use District.
(a) Relationship to comprehensive plan. The MXU zoning district may be appropriate for the village center residential, town center mixed use, neighborhood activity center, and community activity center future development areas established by the comprehensive plan. The MXU zoning district may be appropriate to implement the downtown, community, and neighborhood activity center future land use categories established by the comprehensive plan.
(b) Purposes and intentions. The MXU district is established to provide locations for planned combination of commercial and office uses with residential uses. Appropriate intensities of development are directly related to the varying intensities encouraged by the comprehensive plan in various locations throughout the city. The intent of the MXU district is to allow the opportunity for an integrated mixture of residential and commercial employment-generating uses within the same structure or site, including upper floor residential over ground floor commercial or office uses; and the combination of residential and nonresidential uses on the same floor, such as ground-floor live-work units. Uses within a MXU zoning district are intended to be located and designed as a unified development.
(c) Permitted and special uses. Permitted and special uses shall be as provided in Table 2-3, Permitted and Special Uses in Mixed-Use and Non-residential Zoning Districts.
(d) Dimensional requirements. Unless otherwise specified in Table 2-4, Dimensional Requirements for Mixed-Use and Non-residential Zoning Districts of this code, design features of a mixed-use development, such as minimum lot sizes, minimum lot widths and frontage requirements, buffer widths, building setbacks, minimum dwelling unit floor areas, and maximum building heights, will be established on a project-by-project basis,
Article 2, Zoning Districts and Official Zoning Map, City of Powder Springs Unified Development Code
31
incorporating specifications and site plans of the development into conditions of zoning approval.
(e) Design review. Design review shall be required as specified in article 5, Site and Architectural Design Review, of this development code.
(f) Land use mix. The proportion and distribution of nonresidential to residential uses in a Mixed-Use development is determined by the land use category in which the mixed-use development is located as delineated on the future land use map of the comprehensive plan. The applicable future land use map category also determines the maximum number of dwelling units and the maximum commercial and office floor area that can be allowed in the mixed-use development based on the maximum allowed density. These limitations and the distribution of residential density within a mixed-use development are specified in Table 2-5.
(g) Minimum area for rezoning. The minimum land area to rezone to the MXU zoning district is two acres.
(h) Development. Commercial structures and uses are to be located and designed as a unified development. Residential and commercial/office uses may either be located in freestanding buildings within a site, or combined together within the same building. Development is to be carefully planned to ensure the benefits of mixed-use development are fully realized and potential negative impacts of one use on another are minimized, both within the development and along its periphery.
(i) Sequencing of commercial with residential development. Unless another sequencing provision is substituted by Mayor and City Council as part of the MXU development approval, no more than 50% of the total number of dwelling units authorized in the MXU development shall receive building permits from the city until a building permit is issued, and certificate of occupancy is issued for at least 5,000 square feet of nonresidential space or 25% of the square footage of nonresidential development authorized in the MXU development, whichever is greater.

The O-I zoning district is intended to implement the office professional future land use category shown on the future land use plan map established by the comprehensive plan.
(b) Purposes and intentions. The O-I zoning district is established to provide locations for office park development and to accommodate institutional uses. Uses are limited primarily to professional offices. The O-I zoning district is intended to provide an appropriate transition between neighborhood or commercial activity centers as described in the comprehensive plan, and single-family neighborhoods. Properties containing single-family dwellings on lots fronting heavily traveled roads may be considered appropriate for this zoning district if they are transitional in nature, i.e., experiencing diminished desirability for continued residential use and increased utility for adaptive reuse as offices. Commercial retail and services supporting office uses and compatible with adjacent single-family residential neighborhoods are also appropriate in this district.
(c) Permitted and special uses. Permitted and special uses shall be as provided in Table 2-3, Permitted and Special Uses in Mixed-Use and Non-residential Zoning Districts.
(d) Dimensional requirements. Minimum lot size, minimum lot width, maximum building height, minimum building setbacks and other dimensional requirements shall be as provided in Table 2-4, Dimensional Requirements for Mixed-Use and Non-residential Zoning Districts.
(e) Design review. Design review shall be required as specified in article 5, Site and Architectural Design Review, of this development code.

Sec. 2-25. CBD, Central Business District.
(a) Relationship to comprehensive plan. The CBD zoning district is intended to implement the town center mixed use future development area established by the comprehensive plan. The CBD zoning district is intended to implement the downtown activity center future land use category established by the comprehensive plan.
(b) Purposes and intentions. The CBD zoning district corresponds with the established downtown area of Powder Springs, which is the historic cultural, business, and
Article 2, Zoning Districts and Official Zoning Map, City of Powder Springs Unified Development Code
41
governmental center of the city. The CBD zoning district is intended foster a unique sense of place and identity for the city. This intent can be achieved by providing for an appropriate mixture of land uses and intensity of development conducive to maintaining the downtown area as a focal point for civic activities and traditional main street retail commercial and service uses. The CBD zoning district is also intended to provide for a vibrant mix of land uses within easy walking distance of abutting and adjacent neighborhoods, including commercial, office, various forms of housing, civic uses, and parks and recreation areas. Townhomes and loft apartments are considered particularly appropriate residential uses. The absence of front building setbacks in the CBD zoning district encourages a public realm that promotes street life while allowing for greater utilization of the land.

Division II. Towers and Wireless Telecommunications Facilities.
Sec. 4-405. Purposes and Intentions.
The purpose of this article is to establish guidelines for the siting of all wireless telecommunication equipment and facilities, microwave towers, common carrier towers, cellular, television and radio telecommunications towers and antennae. The regulations and requirements of this article are adopted for the following purposes:
(a) To provide for the location of communication towers and communication antennas; and to protect residential areas and land uses from potentially adverse impacts of communication towers, monopoles, and antennas by restricting them in accordance with this article.
(b) To minimize adverse visual impacts of communication towers and antennas through careful design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques.
(c) To accommodate the growing need for communication towers and antennas while minimizing the total number of towers within the community necessary to provide adequate personal wireless services to residents.
(d) To promote and encourage shared use/co-location of existing and new communication towers (i.e., the use of multiple antennae operated by different providers on a single tower) as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-user towers or monopoles.
(e) To promote and encourage placement of antennae on existing towers and on building and other structures where such siting options exist.
(f) To consider public health, safety, and welfare in the siting of new towers, and to avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower or monopole failure through engineering and careful siting of tower structures.
(g) To limit the siting of telecommunications facilities and towers where they will have the least adverse impact on the community and still comply with the requirements of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Public Law No. 104-104, 47 U.S.C. Section 332(c)(7)). These intentions are accomplished with restriction of locations and by enacting controls on height, setbacks, screening, color, and materials in order to minimize visibility and promote public safety and welfare. The regulations in this division are reasonably related to the valid public purposes described in this Section.
(h) It is not the intent of the Mayor and Council to discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent services or to prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of wireless services in the city. It is also the intent of the city that applications to place, construct, or modify personal wireless service facilities will be acted upon within a reasonable time.
Article 4, Specific Use Provisions, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
118
Sec. 4-410. Applicability and Exemptions.
All new communication towers, monopoles, and communication antennas shall be subject to this division, except that this division shall not govern the following:
(a) Any tower, or the installation of any antenna, that is 70 feet or less in height and is owned and operated by a federally-licensed amateur radio station operator or ham radio operator from the ham radio operator's residence.
(b) Antennae or towers located on property owned, leased, or otherwise controlled by the City of Powder Springs, Cobb County, or Cobb County Board of Education, provided that a license or lease authorizing such antenna or tower has been approved by the government or agency with jurisdiction.
(c) Monopole towers 100 feet or less in height located within electrical substations and antennae attached to existing transmission towers.
Sec. 4-415. Performance and Construction Standards.
(a) Structural Design. New communication towers or monopoles and antennae, and modifications to existing structures including, without limitation, the addition of height, antennae or service providers, shall be constructed in accordance with applicable federal, state and local regulations.
(b) Placement Restrictions. Towers occupying a lot as a principal use shall at minimum meet the minimum lot size and setback requirements for the zoning district in which the lot is located. Towers shall be a minimum of 300 feet from any residential zoning district. All towers shall be located at least one-half of their height in feet from any public right-of-way. When the tower is on leased property, the setbacks shall apply to the lot of record, not the lease boundaries.
(c) Screening. The visual impacts of a communication tower at the ground level shall be mitigated by landscaping. All towers and accessory structures shall be surrounded on the ground by a minimum ten foot wide landscape strip or buffer that forms a hardy screen dense enough to interrupt vision and shield the base and accessory structures from public view and view from the surrounding properties. The buffer shall consist of evergreens that will reach a minimum height of at least eight feet within three years.
(d) Fencing. A wall, or a black vinyl-coated chain link fence, with a minimum height of six feet from finished grade, shall be provided around each communication tower or monopole. Access to the tower or monopole shall be through a locked gate. The tower or monopole shall be equipped with an appropriate anti-climbing device, unless the community development director waives this requirement for alternative tower structures.
(e) Height. Through approval of a special use application, the height of the tower may exceed the maximum height limit of the zoning district in which it is located, up to a
Article 4, Specific Use Provisions, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
119
height of two hundred feet, subject to the limitations of this paragraph. Towers shall be the minimum height necessary to provide parity with existing similar tower-supported antenna. No tower, pole, or antenna, whether freestanding or attached to a building or structure, shall exceed two-hundred feet in height from ground level unless approval is obtained via special use permit. To prevail in any special use application to exceed established maximum height limitations of this paragraph, the applicant must successfully demonstrate why the prescribed maximum height is insufficient to provide adequate service, or that a taller tower will be in the community's interest by avoiding the construction of one or more additional towers at a new location.
(f) Illumination. Communication towers, monopoles, or antennae shall not be lighted except to assure human safety or as required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Federal Communications Commission, or other federal agency with jurisdiction. Lighting shall be restricted to dual lighting, medium intensity white strobe lights (daylight mode), and red obstruction lights (nighttime mode), unless the FAA or state aeronautics division requires another type of lighting.
(g) Color and Material. Towers clustered at the same site shall be of similar height and design. Communication towers not required to be painted or marked by the Federal Aviation Administration shall have either galvanized steel finish or be painted a non-contrasting color approved by the Mayor and Council to minimize the equipment's visibility. If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower, the antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical or closely compatible with the color of the supporting structure to render the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. During the review process, the Mayor and Council may require the camouflaging of towers where appropriate and feasible.
(h) Signs and advertising. No advertising is permitted on a tower or antenna. However, towers shall have mounted in a conspicuous place a sign of not more than one square foot in area, identifying the facility's owner and providing a means of contact in the event of an emergency.
(i) Co-location. Owners of proposed communication antennas may and are encouraged to co-locate on existing communication towers. New or additional special use approval is not required for the addition of an antenna to an existing approved tower or monopole. All towers over 100 feet in height shall have structural capacity and ground or interior space to accommodate multiple users as follows: towers up 160 feet shall accommodate at least three users, and towers taller than 160 feet shall accommodate at least five users.
(j) Noninterference. No communication tower or antenna shall interfere with public safety communication. Frequency coordination is required to ensure noninterference with public safety system and/or public safety entities.
Article 4, Specific Use Provisions, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
120
Sec. 4-420. Application Requirements.
Each application for a use pursuant to this division shall include the following information, which is in addition to the information required for special use applications generally, if required:
(a) A recorded plat or boundary survey.
(b) A site plan, with topographical information.
(c) An elevation view, perspective drawing, or simulated photograph of how the proposed telecommunication tower will appear from public rights-of-way and surrounding residential streets from which the tower will be visible once constructed.
(d) Supporting engineering calculations and information which provide evidence of need and document radio frequency range, coverage area, and tower height requirements. The application must specifically address whether there is a technically suitable space available on an existing tower or other location within the search area (i.e., the grid for the placement of the antenna), and such information shall specifically include the location of all existing towers within a one-mile radius of the site proposed.
(e) The community development director may require certification as to structural integrity of any telecommunications tower, monopole or antenna array.
(f) The community development director shall be authorized to charge a fee to the applicant in an amount designed to allow the city to retain the services of one or more consultants, engineers, or other experts in the area of radio frequency engineering or other relevant fields to assist the city in analyzing the application and providing an independent assessment of the information submitted as a part of the application.
Sec. 4-425. Application Processing.
Decisions on applications for wireless service facilities shall be made within a reasonable period of time, which shall mean generally that such decisions shall be processed in roughly the same amount of time required for other special use applications; provided, however, that the Mayor and Council shall table an application for special use for a wireless service facility no more than once before making a decision, unless the applicant does not object to additional continuances.
Sec. 4-430. Criteria to Consider in Acting upon Applications.
In addition to the criteria for determining whether to approve or deny special uses, as specified in this development code, when an application for wireless telecommunication facilities or equipment is considered, the Mayor and Council in the case of a special use permit shall consider the following criteria without limitation:
Article 4, Specific Use Provisions, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
121
(a) Impacts on surrounding properties with regard to aesthetics and fit with the context of its surroundings, considering the location, height, type of facility, color and materials proposed.
(b) Whether impacts on surrounding properties on aesthetics can be mitigated by alternative designs, such as making the tower resemble common features such as church steeples, bell towers, clock towers, grain silos, gateway elements, and monuments, or by requiring greater setback from impacted properties.
(c) Whether the tower or wireless facility would pose an unreasonable risk to adjoining properties, including consideration of a fall area where ice or other debris may fall off the tower without harm.
(d) The appropriateness of the location of existing towers, monopoles, and buildings, or other structures including electric transmission towers, that might serve as alternative locations to construction of a new tower or monopole or placement on a building in a new location. It is the intent that, where possible, new antennae shall be co-located on existing towers and monopoles, placed on existing buildings, or be within a concealed support structure (e.g., camouflaged as a, church steeple, clock tower, grain silo, flagpole, etc.), prior to authorizing the installation of a new non-camouflaged pole or tower. The failure to consider or unwillingness to accept viable options as described in this paragraph may be grounds for denial of a special use application for a new tower or monopole.
(e) Whether the application demonstrates compliance with the regulations established in this division.
(f) Whether the tower would be engineered and constructed to accommodate additional communication service providers (i.e., whether the application provides for co-location as required by this division).
(g) Whether a denial of the application would have the effect of prohibiting wireless services in the jurisdiction or area or would unduly restrict competition among wireless providers.
In addition, Mayor and Council shall make a decision on the application based on substantial evidence to allow a reviewing court to understand the reasoning behind the decision and whether that reasoning is consistent with the evidence presented. To this end, for each application for wireless service facilities, Mayor and Council shall rely on findings of fact in making a decision on said application. Such findings may be part of the recommendation and report of the community development director, the application and supporting materials submitted by the applicant, testimony from interested individuals, professionals, and the applicant, and any additional findings of fact the Mayor and Council may itself determine. Generalized community concerns, unaccompanied by supporting documentation, do not constitute substantial evidence under Section 704 of the Telecommunication Act of 1996 or this division.
Sec. 4-435. Amateur Radio, Citizens Band Radio and Other Receive-only Radio Antennae.
Article 4, Specific Use Provisions, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
122
a) Amateur radio, Citizens Band radio and other receive-only radio antennae may be installed on masts or towers anywhere within the buildable lot area, except in residential and mixed use zoning districts.
b) In residential and mixed-use zoning districts, masts or free-standing towers shall be located in the side or rear yard but not within the minimum side or rear yard setback for principal buildings.
c) The maximum height for masts or free-standing towers regulated by this section is 35 feet above ground level.

Division III. Adult Entertainment.
Sec. 4-505. Purposes.
This division has been enacted for the following purposes:
(a) Promoting the health and general welfare of the city.
(b) Preserving the quality of life in residential and business areas of the community.
(c) Providing clear and definite standards for the licensing of, and the operation of, adult entertainment establishments within the city.
(d) Promoting desirable living conditions and sustaining the stability of neighborhoods and property values.
(e) Preventing the use of adult entertainment establishments for unlawful purposes. It is not the purpose of this division to legislate or regulate with respect to matters of obscenity, or with respect to any other matters exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Georgia General Assembly.
Sec. 4-510. Authority.
Pursuant to its charter the City has all powers possible for a city to have under the present or future Constitution and laws of the state. Pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-35-3, the City is authorized to adopt reasonable ordinances, resolutions or regulations relating to all property within the city of Powder Springs, its affairs and local government. In particular, the City is authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 36-60-3 to enact ordinances which shall have the effect of restricting the operation of adult bookstores, explicit media outlets, and adult movie houses to areas zoned for commercial or industrial purposes, which is a proper exercise of the City's police powers. However, nothing in O.C.G.A. § 36-60-3 shall be construed so as to prohibit the adoption of restrictions relating to the location of adult bookstores, explicit media outlets, adult movie houses and all other forms of adult entertainment by the City Council which are more stringent than the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 36-60-3.
Sec. 4-515. Findings.
Based on the experiences of other cities and counties, including, but not limited to, Austin, Texas, and Garden Grove, California, which experiences are found to be relevant to the potential problems faced in Powder Springs, Georgia, and based on documentary evidence submitted to the city council, the city council takes note of the well-known and self-evident conditions and potentially adverse secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly across communities within the United States of America.
The City Council also relies on evidence concerning the potentially adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in reports which were made available to the City Council,
Article 4, Specific Use Provisions, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
124
and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S. 50 (1976); FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215 (1990); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 529 U.S. 277 (2000); City of Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., 535 U.S. 425 (2002); and Daytona Grand, Inc. v. City of Daytona Beach, Florida, 490 F.3d 860 (2007), including, but not limited to, the following:
(a) Adult entertainment establishments lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is no mechanism other than the regulations in this division to assign responsibility for the activities that occur on their premises to the owners of these establishments.
(b) Certain employees of adult entertainment establishments engage in a higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments.
(c) Sexual acts, including masturbation and oral and anal sex, occur at adult entertainment establishments, especially those that provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos or live sex shows.
(d) Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions and fosters illegal activities.
(e) Persons frequent certain adult entertainment establishments for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such adult entertainment establishments.
(f) Some 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in adult entertainment establishments, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, hepatitis non-A, hepatitis non-B, amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections.
(g) Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics that should be reasonably regulated in order to address substantial governmental concerns.
(h) A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of adult entertainment establishments. Further, such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the operators to ensure that adult entertainment establishments are operated in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the adult entertainment establishment, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein.
(i) Requiring licensees of adult entertainment establishments to maintain information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of
Article 4, Specific Use Provisions, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
125
certain types of criminal behaviors by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments.
(j) The fact that an applicant for an adult entertainment establishment license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in violation of this division.
(k) Under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in establishments offering live nude entertainment or adult entertainment (whether such alcoholic beverages are sold on the premises or not) partial or total public nudity begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable secondary effects. Similarly, establishments offering cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment can have identical deleterious effects on the community.
(l) Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, live commercial nudity in general, and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public solicitation, public indecency, drug use and drug trafficking. Among the undesirable conditions identified in other communities when commercial live nudity occurs in combination with alcohol, commercial nudity in general and cinematographic or videographic adult entertainment are the depression of property values and acceleration of blight in the surrounding neighborhood. Increased allocation of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burdens on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior described in this subsection are also among these undesirable conditions. The City Council finds it reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable conditions will occur in the City as well.
(m) Other forms of adult entertainment, including, but not limited to, adult bookstores, adult novelty shops, adult video stores, peep shows, adult theaters, and massage parlors, have an adverse effect upon the quality of life in surrounding neighborhoods.
(n) The negative secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments on the City are similar whether the adult entertainment establishment features live nude dancing or sells videotapes depicting sexual activities.
(o) It is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community and the preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods, places of worship, schools, child day care centers and public parks to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments. Therefore, the City Council finds that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult entertainment establishment. Licensing is a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to ensure that operators of adult entertainment establishments comply with reasonable regulations and to ensure that operators do not knowingly allow their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation. The City Council finds that the regulations in this Division promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including, but not limited to, reducing criminal activity and protecting against or
Article 4, Specific Use Provisions, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
126
eliminating undesirable conditions, and further finds and intends that such regulations will not infringe upon the protected Constitutional rights of freedom of speech and expression.
(p) Nothing contained in this Division shall be deemed to permit or condone any activity whatsoever which is otherwise found to be obscene, lewd or illegal under applicable laws that prohibit nudity or sexual activity. Further, the activities and uses which are regulated by this Division shall only be allowed if they are not obscene or lewd and not in violation of any other such prohibitions on nudity or sexual activity.

Sec. 5-1. Findings.
The Powder Springs Mayor and City Council find that its citizens have widely shared human values related to the visual environment. The desire to protect certain features of the visual environment reflects a widespread pattern of community preference. That finding is supported by community visioning and character area delineation completed as a part of the citys comprehensive planning process. Regulations for design review and aesthetics are therefore based on the visual sensibilities of the average person in the community. The Mayor and City
Article 5, Site and Architectural Design Review, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
146
Council find further that visual harm to a widespread pattern of community preference can occur without the imposition of the site design and architectural review provisions adopted in this article. The requirements contained in this article are related to legitimate public purposes, and they are the minimum necessary to prevent substantial harm to existing features of the visual environment of the city.
Without guidance, future developments will likely be self-contained, compartmentalized, and without coherence and relationship with other developments. Without guidance, developers are unlikely to interrelate streets, buildings, human uses, and natural systems in a manner that results in a coordinated, pleasing, and sustainable-built environment across property lines. Left to its own workings, the real estate development industry is unlikely to produce development that is coordinated with adjacent buildings and uses.
Sec. 5-2. Purposes.
Establishing the appropriate character of the city requires attention to the aesthetics of development, buildings, and sites. It is in the public interest to direct and control the visual appearance of buildings, structures, landscapes, and development in the city, to prevent patently offensive harm to the existing visual character of the city, and to safeguard the happiness, comfort, and general well-being of citizens. Careful attention to the architectural design of buildings and the layout of land development sites is in the best interests of the city, its citizens, and business owners. Attractive and integrated architectural and site design features tend to improve an areas image, raise overall property values, attract new businesses and residents, and improve the quality of life.
Design guidelines provide criteria to evaluate the appropriateness of proposed changes to individual buildings, properties, and land use activities The design guidelines provided in this article are intended to provide clear guidance to property owners and their engineers, landscape architects, site designers, and architects on best practices for site design, land development, and architecture of buildings. Criteria in this article allow for a wide range of architectural and site design solutions but also articulate strong preferences for certain designs. These guidelines are not intended to force a level of sameness; instead, a richness of character and expression is desired.
This article is intended to establish a predictable and clear process for review and approval of the site design of land developments and architectural features of buildings.
Sec. 5-3. Design-Related Definitions.
Appearance: The outward aspect of a building or site development that is visible to the public.
Architectural appearance, exterior: The architectural character and general composition of the exterior of a building or structure, including but not limited to the kind, color, and texture of the building material and the type, design, and character of all windows, doors, light fixtures, signs attached to the building or structure, and any appurtenant elements.

(c) Whether the design, scale, arrangement, materials, and colors of the proposed building(s) or structure(s) is compatible with buildings and structures in the immediate surrounding area or the same zoning district.
Sec. 5-18. Decision with Regard to Architectural Design Applications.
(a) The community development director shall render a decision on the architectural design application as expediently as possible but within no more than 30 calendar days from the date a complete application is received.
(b) If the Mayor and City Council has jurisdiction over architectural design review, a decision shall be made on the application within no more than 60 calendar days from the date a complete application was scheduled for consideration by the Mayor and City Council; provided, however, that this time frame for decision may be extended with the consent of the applicant. For any application involving review and approval of architectural design by the Mayor and City Council, the meeting or meetings at which the application will be considered must be attended by the applicant or representative thereof
Article 5, Site and Architectural Design Review, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
158
with authority to make binding commitments to the city with respect to any stipulations that may be offered in connection with such application. Failure of the applicant or representative thereof to attend any work session, meeting, or hearing during which the architectural design application is considered shall result in the application being tabled one time. Failure to attend a rescheduled work session, meeting, or hearing shall be cause for denial of the application.
(c) If the community development director (or approval authority) finds that the proposal meets the criteria for architectural design as specified in this division, the director shall approve the application.
(d) If the director (or approval authority) finds that the proposal is mostly acceptable but requires modifications, the director may approve the application with conditions or the director may request changes and require modifications to the proposed design for consideration as a modified application at a future date.
(e) If the director (or approval authority) finds that the proposal fails to meet the criteria for architectural design specified by this article, or does not comply with this unified development code, the application shall be denied. Among other grounds for considering a design inappropriate are the following defects: character foreign to the area, arresting and spectacular effects, violent contrasts of material or color, intense or lurid colors, a multiplicity or incongruity of details resulting in a restless and disturbing appearance, and the absence of unity and coherence in composition not in consonance with the density and character of the present structure or surrounding area.
Sec. 5-19. Notice of Decision.
The community development director shall notify the applicant in writing of the action taken on design review applications promptly after the date action was taken on said application. If the application was denied, the reasons for the denial shall be stated in the written notice of decision.
Sec. 5-20. Reapplication and Appeal.
(a) An applicant for architectural design approval may revise plans and reapply for architectural design approval.
(b) Denial of a design review application by the community development director may be appealed as an administrative decision, in accordance with the requirements of article 14 of this development code; provided, however, that public notice of such an appeal shall not be required, and the appeal of a design plan decision by the community development director shall be placed on the next regular meeting of the Mayor and City Council for consideration. The Mayor and City Council for good cause may affirm, reverse, overturn or otherwise modify a decision of the community development director with respect to an architectural design application, upon the proper filing of an appeal.
Article 5, Site and Architectural Design Review, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
159
(c) Decisions of the Mayor and City Council with regard to an architectural design application, whether with original jurisdiction or on appeal, shall be final, subject to any further legal remedy by a court with jurisdiction.
Sec. 5-21. Compliance with Approved Applications.
(a) Approval of site and architectural design applications is conditioned on compliance with the approved application(s).
(b) After the development and building are constructed and completed, but before issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the community development director or designee shall inspect the site and building for compliance with the approved design plans for the site or building.
(c) The community development director shall direct the building inspector not to issue a certificate of occupancy if the site or building is not in compliance with approved design plans.
[Secs. 5-22 5-30 Reserved].
Division III. Site Design Requirements and Guidelines.
Sec. 5-31. Applicability.
Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise as specifically provided in this article, the development requirements and guidelines of this division are intended to apply to all land uses except for detached, single-family dwellings.
Sec. 5-32. Interpretation.
(a) Those provisions in this division and the following division which use the term shall are regulations and must be followed.
(b) When the terms should and are encouraged are used in this division and the following division, the language shall be considered a guideline, and flexibility toward compliance may be exercised if it is determined by the community development director that the spirit and intent of the guideline is being followed or an alternative to the guideline is acceptable.
Sec. 5-33. Existing Site Features.
(a) Significant site features such as habitats, natural ground forms, existing site vegetation, large rock outcroppings, water, and significant view corridors should be identified on grading plans as protected from land disturbance and incorporated into development plans.
Article 5, Site and Architectural Design Review, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
160
(b) When the alteration or improvement of significant natural resource areas are permitted, the site designer should ensure that potential losses are mitigated and best management practices are employed to minimize permanent damage.
(c) Existing vegetation should be retained to the maximum extent possible. Clearing of native vegetation should be limited to that required for the provision of essential purposes (i.e., access, building, sewage disposal, etc.). Where appropriate, existing native vegetation should be enhanced with plantings of the same variety.
(d) Environmental functions damaged by prior site activities should be restored and enhanced.
(e) Land subject to flooding, improper drainage or erosion, or that is unsuitable for the use for topographical or other reasons, shall not be platted or developed for any use that will continue or increase the danger to health, safety, or of property destruction, unless the hazards can be and are corrected. Each lot or development site shall contain an adequate are for building, not subject to flooding and outside the limits of any existing easements or required building setback lines.
Adequate Building Area Required
Sec. 5-34. Grading.
(a) Developments should be designed to fit the existing contours and landform of the site and to minimize the amount of earthwork.
(b) Excavation and earthwork should be kept to a minimum to reduce visual impacts and erosion. Where cut and fill is required, balancing the cut and fill is highly encouraged.
Illustrative Cut and Fill
Article 5, Site and Architectural Design Review, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
161
(c) Abrupt or unnatural-appearing grading is strongly discouraged. Avoid the creation of harsh, easily eroded banks and cuts.
(d) When cut or fill is involved in the grading of an individual building pad or development site, the finished grade of the parking lot or driveway should be terminated far enough inside the property to allow for the slope to return to that of the natural grade or finished ground elevation at the property line. When inter-parcel access is provided or required, the slope at such a property line or provided shall not exceed 10 percent. The purposes of this design guideline is to both facilitate inter-parcel access at reasonable grades between compatible land uses and to avoid harsh differences in grade between abutting properties. This practice also provides for a blending of the finished site elevations in a manner so that stark contrasts in the landscape will not occur. Where inter-parcel access is not required due to incompatible land uses, grade differentiation at a property line may be permitted but should be mitigated or softened as much as possible.
(e) The height and length of retaining walls should be minimized and screened with appropriate landscaping. Tall, smooth-faced concrete retaining walls should be avoided in highly visible areas. Terracing should be considered as an alternative to the use of tall or prominent retaining walls, particularly in highly visible areas on hillsides.
(f) Disturbed areas which are not used for roads, buildings, or other auxiliary uses should be replanted.
Sec. 5-35. Drainage and Low Impact Development.
(a) Land developers shall utilize, to the maximum extent practicable, stormwater better site design practices as described in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. During the land development permitting process, a stormwater management plan is required (see article 11 of this development code). As specified in article 11, the city will require the land development applicant to examine and where feasible implement stormwater management methods broadly referred to as low-impact development and as specifically referred to in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual as stormwater better site design practices and limited application structural stormwater controls (i.e., filter strips, grassed channels, and porous concrete, among others (reference: GSMM, Vol. 2, Sec. 3.3).
(b) Porous paving materials are encouraged, including porous concrete, porous asphalt, porous unit paver systems, gravel paving systems, to improve infiltration.
Article 5, Site and Architectural Design Review, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
162
Source: Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, Vol. 2.
(c) Grassy swales and bio-retention areas, with pierced or broken curbs, is an acceptable and
encouraged alternative to curbing. Where curb is necessary, utilize the pierced or broken
curb option to direct runoff to swales or bio-retention areas. Rain gardens and constructed
wetlands are also encouraged to handle surface drainage of parking lots providing 10 or
more parking spaces.

(d) Mimic the predevelopment site hydrology by using site design techniques that store, infiltrate, evaporate, and detain runoff. Natural drainage patterns that exist on the site will need to be identified (as part of the stormwater planning process) to plan around these critical areas where water will concentrate. Where possible, natural drainage ways should be used to convey runoff over and off the site to avoid the expense and problems of constructing an artificial drainage system. Natural on-site drainage patterns and low impact development methods such as vegetative swales and bioretention should be used to the maximum extent practicable.
(e) Stormwater management designers should reduce, minimize, and disconnect the total impervious area at the site. Disconnect as much impervious area as possible to increase opportunities for infiltration and reduce water runoff flow.
(f) Maximize overland sheet flow. Incorporate onsite infiltration into existing parking lot designs where possible.
(g) Minimize and then mitigate the hydrologic impacts of land use activities closer to the source of generation. This can be done by implementing the principle of microstorage, or breaking up drainage areas into small manageable subcatchment areas. Break up flow directions from large paved surfaces, and direct stormwater where appropriate to drain to natural systems, vegetated buffers, natural resource areas, or infiltratable zones/soils.

(i) Man-made lakes and stormwater ponds should be designed for maximum habitat value
and/or to serve as amenity features.
(j) Stormwater ponds and facilities that are visible from the public right-of-way shall be
landscaped with a combination of densely planted shrubs and ground cover. Any fencing
surrounding a stormwater pond that is visible from the public right-of-way shall be
decorative in nature, or if chain link fencing is permitted it shall be vinyl coated green or
black.
Article 5, Site and Architectural Design Review, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
166
Sec. 5-36. Interparcel Access.
Inter-parcel access for vehicles between abutting and nearby properties shall be provided so that access to individual properties can be achieved between adjacent and nearby developments as an alternative to forcing all movement onto abutting highways and public roads, unless the community development director during development permit and/or the site design approval process determines that it is unnecessary to provide inter-parcel access due to the unlikelihood of patrons traveling among two or more existing or proposed uses on abutting or nearby sites, or where the two land uses are incompatible.
Illustrative Interparcel Access
Where opportunities for shared or interparcel access have been identified by the community development director, developments must provide shared or interparcel access with adjoining properties to facilitate driveway connections between parcels. The property owner shall grant an access easement to facilitate the movement of motor vehicles and pedestrians from site to site.

Sec. 5-37. Utilities.
(a) All electrical, cable, telephone and other such services shall be installed underground.
(b) All transformers and other facilities and equipment, including telecommunications equipment, shall either be screened through the use of architectural materials compatible with the architectural materials present on the site or, alternatively, through landscape screening. Such screening shall be adequate to completely screen such facilities from view from the right-of-way.
(c) Utility easements should be coordinated and combined to minimize the number of additional easements and stream and road crossings needed. Utility easements should be landscaped.

Sec. 5-38. Exterior Lighting.
(a) Exterior lighting should be architecturally compatible with the building style, material, and colors.
(b) Fixture mounting height should be appropriate for the project and the setting. The mounting height of fixtures in smaller parking lots or service areas should not exceed twenty feet, with lower mounting heights encouraged, particularly where adjacent to residential areas or other sensitive land uses.
(c) All outdoor light fixtures shall be fully shielded or be designed or provided with light angle cut-offs, so as to eliminate up-lighting, spill light, and glare.
Cut-Off Fixtures
(d) Use of low, bollard-type fixtures, three to four feet in height, are encouraged as pedestrian area lighting.
(e) Provide human-scaled, decorative street lighting along streets designated for main street or town center pedestrian retail uses, to create a distinct character. The fixtures should match or resemble those already installed along streetscapes in Powder Springs.

Sec. 5-39. Pedestrian Circulation.
(a) Except in industrial zoning districts, pedestrian circulation should take precedence over vehicular circulation. Pedestrian ways shall be well defined, should take as direct a path as possible, and they should be separated where practical from automobile access ways. Parking aisle dividers are appropriate locations for pedestrian access facilities. Relocate landscape areas that may interfere with pedestrian short cuts.
Illustrative Provision of Pedestrian Access

(b) Sidewalks on individual properties shall connect to the sidewalk system within public road right-of-way, where such system exists or is planned.
(c) All principal entries to a building shall provide direct pedestrian access to the sidewalk within a public right-of-way or along a dedicated street.
(d) When multiple buildings are proposed on a single development site, they shall be linked with on-site pedestrian walkways.
(e) Where pedestrian circulation crosses vehicular routes, a change in grade, paving material, or texture, or paving color should be provided to emphasize the conflict point and improve its visibility and safety. Accent strips of brick or textured paving may also be appropriate for defining pedestrian walkways.
Article 5, Site and Architectural Design Review, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
170
Sec. 5-40. Driveway Throat Depth.
Designers should strive to provide a 100 foot deep clear zone between the pavement of an arterial road and the first turning movement from an internal driveway. On any other road (city street) the clear zone or throat length should be at least 50 feet before a turning movement occurs (including parking), to provide sufficient queuing room for cars and/or delivery vehicles exiting the street. This provision may be modified by the community development director after review by a traffic engineer or city engineer.
Provide Adequate Driveway

Sec. 5-41. Parking.
The visual impact and presence of vehicles shall be minimized, preferably by siting parking areas to the rear or side of the property rather than alongside the street.
Sec. 5-42. Service Functions.
(a) Service functions (e.g., deliveries, maintenance activities) need to be integrated into the circulation pattern in a manner which minimizes conflicts with vehicles and pedestrians.
(b) Access for service vehicles, shall be provided to the rear or sides of buildings being served.

171
Sec. 5-43. Open Spaces.
(a) Open spaces, such as greens and squares, should be located and designed to add to the visual amenities of the development.
(b) Greens and squares should be spatially defined and distributed throughout the development so that no lot is more than a walking distance of 1,350 feet from a green, square, or park. Greens and squares should not be less than 8,000 square feet in area.
(c) A mix of peripheral as well as internal green space should be provided.

Sec. 5-43. Plazas and Pedestrian-gathering Places.
In pedestrian retail and institutional areas, designers are encouraged to provide plazas or gathering places by including design elements such as play areas, landscaping, street furniture, public art, and/or other attractive features that reflect the desired district character. Gathering places provide area for activities that promote safe community interaction, exchange, and congregation.
[Secs. 5-44 to 5-50 Reserved].
Division IV. Architectural Design Requirements and Guidelines.
Sec. 5-51. Architectural Design Compatibility.
Buildings or other improvements should be compatible with the orientation, directional emphasis, shape, volume, massing, proportion, rhythm, scale and materials of the context, setting and streetscape of the site. Architectural design should be compatible with the developing character of the neighboring area. Design compatibility includes complementary building style, form, size, color, materials, and detailing. Determinations of compatibility will consider each of the following contexts as appropriate:
(a) Size: The relationship of the project to its site.
(b) Orientation: The relationship of buildings to streets. Buildings should front directly onto public sidewalks unless site features prohibit such building configuration.
Article 5, Site and Architectural Design Review, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
172
(c) Scale: The relationship of the building to those around it. Efforts to coordinate the height of buildings and adjacent structures are encouraged. This is especially applicable where buildings are located very close to each other. It is often possible to adjust the height of a wall, cornice or parapet line to match that of an adjacent building.
(d) Massing: The relationship of the building's various parts to each other.
(e) Fenestration: the placement of windows and doors. The building may incorporate design that is similar to or links with designs of neighboring buildings. For instance, window lines should be placed in a pattern that reflects the same elements on neighboring buildings.
(f) Rhythm: The relationship of fenestration, recesses and projections.
(g) Setback: Placement in relation to setback of immediate surroundings.
(h) Materials: The compatibility of building materials with those used in the zoning district.
(i) Context: The overall relationship of the project to its surroundings.
Architectural Character (Nonresidential)
Sec. 5-52. Building Style.
(a) When more than one building is constructed on a development site or within a planned development, all buildings shall reflect a compatible architectural style and create a cohesive visual relationship between the buildings.
Article 5, Site and Architectural Design Review, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
173
(b) Theme or stylized architecture which is characteristic of a particular historic period or trend is not encouraged, unless the existing building or site is historically important to the district or necessary for architectural harmony.
(c) Franchise architecture will be reviewed for compatibility with surroundings and may require adjustments to be compatible with surrounding buildings in the district.
Sec. 5-53. Building Materials.
(a) All construction shall be brick, stone, wood, glass in combination with metal or similar, durable architectural materials. Materials found to be other than durable products are specifically prohibited. Side and rear building elevations should be substantially consistent with the front building elevation.
(b) The following types of building materials shall not be used: highly reflective, shiny, or mirror-like materials; mill-finish (non-colored) aluminum metal windows or door frames; exposed, unfinished foundation walls; exposed plywood or particle board; and exposed, unfinished concrete masonry blocks.
(c) Buildings with all-metal siding shall not be permitted except in industrial zoning districts. In industrial districts, buildings if permitted to be constructed with all-metal siding shall be screened from view from a public or private street.
(d) Smooth-faced concrete block, tilt-up concrete panels, or prefabricated steel panels are discouraged and shall only be permitted in industrial zoning districts. Split face (integrated block) materials may be authorized.
(e) Non-residential building walls shall consist of or be finished on the exterior with brick, stone, wood, cementitious siding, glass in combination with metal, or other similar, durable architectural materials approved by the community development director.
(f) Within the Business Park (BP) zoning district, the exterior walls of any building that is located within a through road corridor and/or is visible from a through road corridor shall be of masonry (excluding concrete, concrete products or hardiplank and/or stucco-type) construction. These building material finishes shall be applied to all sides of the building.
(g) All sides of a building may impact on its surroundings and should be considered for treatment with an architectural finish of primary materials (i.e., brick and stone), unless other materials demonstrating equal or greater quality are used. As a general guide: front and side façades should be at least 50 percent brick and stone; side façades should be at least fifty percent brick and stone. Rear facades do not have a minimum suggested standard for primary materials unless they are visible from a public right-of-way. Requirements for brick or stone may be modified to accommodate creatively designed structures as determined by the community development director. Materials used for side
Article 5, Site and Architectural Design Review, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
174
and rear building elevations should be substantially consistent with the materials used for the front building elevation.
(h) Use of vinyl material in the Central Business District (CBD) zoning district is prohibited. See Sec. 4-130 for regulations regarding use of vinyl on exterior walls of dwelling units. Any vinyl material, if authorized during architectural design review, shall be certified under the product certification program as meeting:
1. The specifications of ASTM D3679 for rigid poly (vinyl chloride) siding with nominal thickness of 0.044 inches or greater that is not laminated and that includes a formed insulation having the same profile as the vinyl panel;
2. Product and color retention certification approvals by the Vinyl Siding Institute:
3. Enhanced panel locking system with features to help straighten the wall appearance;
4. Reinforced nail hem curl or double nail hem designed to increase panel wind load resistance;
5. Polypropylene sidings; and
6. 5/8-inch or greater panel projection.
Sec. 5-54. Modulation.
Avoid constructing buildings with blank facades parallel to public rights-of-ways. In pedestrian activity areas, buildings should exhibit more detail and elements appropriate for close range view by the pedestrian. The walls of building façades for office, institutional, commercial, and industrial use shall not extend more than 200 linear feet unless the front façade of the building (including roof) is designed in a way that modulates the building face into discrete architectural elements. This may be accomplished one or a combination of modulation techniques described below.
(a) Recesses and projections should be used along the front façade to break up long expanses of wall planes (see figure).
(b) Rooflines can be modulated by alternating dormers, or using stepped roofs, gables, or other roof elements.
(c) Windows with awnings above the windows can be provided in a repeating pattern or at regular intervals, or bay windows can be used to achieve some modulation.
Illustrative Recesses and Projections
(d) The building design can incorporate and feature awnings, canopies, porches, porticos, patios, decks, other covered entries to portions of the façade at the ground level, or in the case of buildings containing two or more story, balconies.
Article 5, Site and Architectural Design Review, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
175
(e) Changes to building materials at a change in building plane can achieve some modulation.
(f) In addition to building modulation, large, expansive front building façades should be partially screened with landscaping (see figure).
(g) A horizontal accent stripe (e.g., a foot wide stripe of different color) may be appropriately used to help reduce monotonous color and break up the appearance of large building walls.
Screening of Large Building Walls
Sec. 5-55. Roofs.
(a) Flat roofs are discouraged, unless the zoning district includes buildings already developed with flat roofs, or unless such a design is needed for a green or cool roof.
(b) Roof planes should be varied to increase visual interest.
Sec. 5-56. Awnings and Canopies.
(a) Awnings are encouraged for first floor retail uses to provide architectural interest and to encourage pedestrian activity. Where awnings are used, they should be designed to coordinate with the design of the building and any other awnings along the same block face.
Article 5, Site and Architectural Design Review, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
176
Illustrative Use of Awnings
Source: Oregon Transportation and Growth Management Program, 2012
Model Development Code & Users Guide for Small Cities, 3rd Ed.
(b) Awnings are recommended to be constructed with a durable frame covered by a canvas material.
(c) Flameproof vinyl, canvas, or metal awnings and canopies may be appropriate.
(d) Aluminum and other metal canopies are acceptable in most instances, particularly when integrated into shopping center designs.
(e) Solid colors are preferred over striped awnings, but striping is permitted if colors compliment the character of the structure or group of buildings.
(f) Awnings that are backlit through translucent materials are discouraged if not prohibited altogether.
Sec. 5-57. Colors.
(a) The base color (used on the majority of the building surface) of buildings and accessory buildings and structures should be harmonious and compatible with colors of other buildings within and immediately adjacent to the zoning district in which the building or structure is located.
(b) High-intensity colors, metallic colors, black, or fluorescent colors shall not be used.
Article 5, Site and Architectural Design Review, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
177
(c) Façade colors should be low reflectance, subtle, neutral, or earth tone colors. If a color palette or chart is adopted by the Mayor and City Council and maintained in the office of the community development department, then color selections should be limited to colors so indicated.
(d) Trim color (used on the window trim, fascia, balustrades, and posts) may be brighter than base color.
(e) All vents, gutters, downspouts, flashing, electrical conduits, etc., should be painted to match the color of the adjacent surface, unless they are being used expressly as a trim or accent element.
(f) Accent color may be used with discretion on the buildings exterior.
Sec. 5-58. Architectural Lighting.
(a) Well-designed and distinctive lighting of building facades is one of the best ways to attract attention and make a favorable impression with a minimal investment. Building façade lighting can help enhance the intrinsic charm, beauty, and utility of any given setting. Architectural lighting may include outlining, floodlighting, spotlighting, or any applicable combination of these techniques.
(b) The discrete lighting of a few key architectural features or details is preferred over uniform floodlighting of the entire building façade. Focal points can also be established through careful floodlighting of major buildings, with the lighting of secondary buildings keyed in turn to these focal points.
(c) Highly polished surfaces such as glass, marble, glazed tile, glazed brick, porcelain enamel, and various metals can reflect the image of the light source. Designers should avoid lighting these reflective surfaces directly. Glass buildings usually cannot be lighted for nighttime viewing.
(d) Exterior lighting of the building shall be designed so that light is not directed off the site and the light source is shielded from direct off-site viewing.
(e) Security lighting, unless activated by motion sensor devices, shall be shielded or cutoff fixtures.
Security Lighting
Wallpacks are not permitted unless fully shielded.
Article 5, Site and Architectural Design Review, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
178
Wall Packs
Shielded Wallpacks Permitted
Unshielded Wallpacks Prohibited
Sec. 5-59. Trash and Recycling Collection Facilities.
All institutional, commercial, industrial, multi-family residential sites must provide appropriate refuse dumpsters and areas devoted to the storage of waste materials (including grease or oil containers where used). The minimum area for said requirement shall be 36 square feet.
All garbage dumpsters and other similar areas devoted to the storage of waste materials and grease or oil containers should be screened on 3 sides of said dumpster or area with a minimum 6-foot high (8 feet preferred) wall constructed of materials substantially similar in appearance to the building on site. Dumpster areas must be gated on the fourth side with a material that provides opaque screening, such as a solid, wooden fence matching the height of the surrounding wall.
Recommended Practice for Dumpsters
Temporary dumpsters-
(1) Only one temporary dumpster unit may be placed on a property.
(2) A temporary dumpster unit shall only be placed on a hardened surface and shall be located at the furthest point away from the street.
(3) A temporary dumpster unit or similar enclosure is limited to 30 days on a property during any 365-day period beginning on the date of the placement of the unit.
(4) In no event shall a temporary dumpster or similar enclosure be placed in a public street or on the right of way.
(5) In no event shall a temporary dumpster or similar enclosure pose an obstruction for public safety.
(6) In cases where there is an active building permit to significantly perform a major remodel to an existing structure or to construct a new structure the temporary
Article 5, Site and Architectural Design Review, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
179
dumpster unit or similar enclosure may be placed on the property as long as there is an active building permit and work is progressing to the satisfaction of the building official. Only debris from the permitted construction activity is permitted in a temporary dumpster. In no event will the dumpster unit be allowed to remain on a property for over 180 days. The temporary dumpster unit must be removed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. If no driveway with a hardened surface exists on the property where a new structure is being constructed, a gravel pad shall be provided for placement of the temporary dumpster to prevent erosion on the site.
(7) In cases where a hardship can be demonstrated, the director of community development may grant an extension on a property for 30 days. Only three 30-day extensions may be granted at a specific site by the director of community development. Any additional request for an extension may be considered by the Mayor and Council. A hardship may be caused by an accidental or unintentional fire, flood, natural disaster or other circumstances presented on a case by case basis that creates a need for additional time for the unit to remain on the property. The applicant for the extension shall bear the burden of proof to document and demonstrate, in writing, to the director the basis for the required extension.
Sec. 5-60. Mechanical Systems.
Air conditioning units installed at grade should be sited to the rear or side of the building rather than the front of the building. Mechanical systems located on a rooftop shall be screened from view from the front and side lot lines by a parapet wall or other approved architectural feature.
Roof Top Screening
Sec. 5-61. Accessory Nonresidential Storage Areas.
Any accessory use involving the storage of equipment, refuse, or spare parts, or motorized vehicles under repair, shall be kept inside an enclosed building or otherwise fully shielded from public view by a fully opaque fence kept in good repair.
Sec. 5-62. Fences and Walls.
(a) The design of fences and walls shall be compatible with the architecture of the main building(s) and should use similar materials.
(b) All walls or fences fifty feet in length or longer, and four feet in height or taller, should be designed to minimize visual monotony though changes in plane, height, material or material texture or significant landscape massing.

Division V. Residential Infill Development Guidelines.
Sec. 5-71. Intent and Applicability.
(a) The guidelines in this division are provided to assist applicants and staff in retaining and enhancing the special qualities of Powder Springs neighborhoods. Design review enables the city to evaluate project proposals to ensure that the design and scale of the addition(s) or new structure are consistent with the patterns of development already established within the citys residential areas.
(b) These guidelines may be considered applicable to any new residential development in the city, as determined appropriate by the community development director, although the specific considerations in this division are intended to address dwelling incompatibility issues that occur when one or more dwellings are constructed in an already established residential neighborhood.
Sec. 5-72. Lot Grading and Drainage.
(a) When a lot requires grading, contour grading of slopes is encouraged where feasible to minimize the effect of large, unnatural slopes.
(b) On a sloping lot, consider a step-down dwelling layout (different elevations of the home) as an alternative to extensive cut, fill, and grading operations to level the entire building site.
Placement of Dwelling on Slope

(c) Avoid grading at and near property lines where possible.
Article 5, Site and Architectural Design Review, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
182
(d) Accommodate existing and new drainage patterns and surface water flow that may result from the building project.
Sec. 5-73. Orientation.
(a) The longest dimension of the dwelling footprint should be placed parallel to the primary street.
(b) The primary entrance to a dwelling should face the primary street on which the lot fronts.
Sec. 5-74. Setback.
While a minimum building setback is established for the zoning district in which the dwelling is located, consideration should be given to establishing the front building line in a manner that is consistent with other dwellings on the same side of the street and within 500 feet of the lot to be built upon.
Sec. 5-75. Dwelling Width.
When a new dwelling is to be located on a lot in an infill development area, the width of the dwelling as it parallels the street should not exceed the width of dwellings on adjacent lots.
Sec. 5-76. Height and Scale.
(a) New dwellings should have heights within the range typically observed for dwellings on adjacent or nearby lots in the neighborhood. Where a dwelling must be taller than existing dwellings in the vicinity (e.g., a two-story home along a street where one-story homes are prevalent), the scale of the new, taller infill dwelling should be mitigated through the use of upper story setbacks and articulation of façade planes.
(b) For two-story dwellings or additions, design the second story so that it is subordinate in scale to the first story and so as not to project or overhang the first floor footprint.
Sec. 5-77. Roofs.
(a) Roof forms of the dwelling should be similar to those existing on dwellings in the vicinity.
(b) Flat roofs should be avoided; a minimum roof pitch of at least 4:12 is recommended.
(c) Preferred roofing materials include asphalt composition shingles, tile or standing seam metal. Wood shingles should not be used.
(d) Plumbing, attic, and other vents and other rooftop accessories should be painted or of a material colored to match the color of the roofing material.
Sec. 5-78. Dwelling Entry.
Article 5, Site and Architectural Design Review, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
183
The use of a covered porch, stoop, and/or other entryway feature is encouraged for the dwellings primary entrance. A minimum front porch depth of 6 feet and a minimum area of forty square feet is encouraged.
Sec. 5-79. Additional Architectural Features.
Trellises, balconies, columns, bay windows, and similar architectural projections that are consistent with the architectural style are encouraged.
Sec. 5-80. Walkways and Pathways.
A concrete walkway is encouraged from the dwellings primary entrance to the fronting street, (connected to the public sidewalk where it exists).
Sec. 5-81. Exterior Building Materials.
(a) A range of exterior building materials may be appropriate. Traditional natural materials like kiln-fired brick or stone and wood are preferred, however, other materials such as cementious fiberboard and cedar shake may also be considered, depending on surrounding dwellings and neighborhood covenants.
(b) Materials on the façade to be avoided include metal or aluminum siding, reflective materials and finishes, and unfinished concrete block.
(c) When material changes are incorporated into a façade, they should occur at a change in plane.
(d) Accent materials, if used at the base of the structure, should be at least 3 feet high.
(e) On corner lots, exterior building materials should be consistent on dwelling elevations facing both streets.
Sec. 5-82. Building Articulation.
(a) Projections and recesses should be used to provide shadow and depth. Therefore, long, unbroken volumes and large, unarticulated wall and roof planes should be avoided. In addition, building forms should be articulated by varying roof heights and wall planes.
(b) Roof articulation may be achieved by changes in plane of no less than 2 feet 6 inches and/or the use of traditional roof forms such as gables, hips, and dormers. However, avoid multiple roof angles, types, or slopes that may create a disjointed or chaotic appearance.
(c) As a general guide, at least 25 percent of the façade should be offset a minimum of two feet either projecting from or recessed back from the remainder of the façade.
Article 5, Site and Architectural Design Review, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
184
Sec. 5-83. Windows.
(a) Windows should be rectangular or arched openings of various sizes and forms. Recessed windows should be considered in the design of the structure. Bay windows are also acceptable.
(b) Examples of inappropriate window styles and types are windows flush with the wall, reflective glass, and silver aluminum or gold window frames.
Sec. 5-84. Additions to Principal Dwellings.
(a) Additions to principal dwellings should be similar in height and roof form to the principal dwelling and preferably located to the sides or rear of the primary dwelling.
(b) Incorporate materials and finishes on a building addition or remodel consistent and continuous with the existing dwelling.
Sec. 5-85. Garages and Carports.
(a) Garages attached to the principal dwelling should not face the street, but if such placement is necessary, street-facing garages should be recessed a minimum 10 feet behind the façade of the principal dwelling.
(b) Street-facing garages, where permitted, should have recessed garage doors (i.e., appear to be set into a wall rather than flush with an exterior wall) to allow for shadow and depth.
(c) Pre-fabricated metal carport or storage structures are discouraged and if provided should be located in a rear yard.
Sec. 5-86. Fences and Walls.
(a) Decorative fences and walls should be constructed of consistent and high quality materials to create a coordinated appearance.
(b) Fences and walls, if permitted in front yards, should be at least 50% transparent. Preferred fence composition materials are wood and wrought iron; aluminum picket, painted black is acceptable.
(c) Walls facing the outside of the property should be constructed of decorative block. Wall accent materials are also encouraged.
(d) If a retaining wall is needed in the front yard, its appearance should be mitigated with landscaping between the back of sidewalk (where it exists, or the street right-of-way line) and the wall face.
Article 5, Site and Architectural Design Review, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
185
Sec. 5-87. Trees in Front Yard.
(a) Preserve individual trees and groves of trees where they exist in the front yard, where possible, particularly those providing significant canopy near the public right-of-way.
(b) Plan the location of driveways and curb cuts to avoid existing trees.
Sec. 5-88. Front Yard Landscaping.
(a) Sodded yards may be necessary for consistency in some city neighborhoods.
(b) Unless street trees already exist or a different street tree standard applies, front lawns should be supplemented with two street trees and five shrubs.
Sec. 5-89. Outdoor Lighting.
(a) One foot-candle is the general standard for site lighting. All parking, building, amenity, and site lighting should directed down to diminish nuisance light. Additionally, units should have exterior entry and porch door lights controlled from within the unit.
(b) Solar-powered lighting is acceptable and encouraged, if common throughout.
(c) Gas lamp lighting in the front yard is acceptable.
Sec. 5-90. Utilities.
All utility distribution systems should be underground where possible.

Division I. General Provisions.
Sec. 6-1. Findings.
(a) Need for parking. Space for the parking of motor vehicles is needed to serve every property that contains a principal use, for the safety and convenience of the people who live or work on the property, shop or do business on the property, or otherwise visit the property in the normal course of activity of the principal use.
(b) Need for loading and unloading spaces. Space for the loading and unloading of equipment, supplies, and products is needed to serve properties engaging in such loading and unloading operations. If not required, adequate and proper loading spaces in acceptable locations tend not to be provided.
Article 6, Access, Parking, and Loading, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
187
(c) Environment. Poor design of parking lots can lead to damage to the environment and may require the community to subsidize the interests of a private property owner at the expense of the communitys environment. It is reasonable to good design of parking lots. Possible negative effects of parking and loading areas include changes to microclimate, isolation of pedestrians, increased stormwater runoff, and reduced stormwater infiltration into the ground. Large parking lots can create heat islands where pavement absorbs solar radiation during the day and remains warm well into the night. When heat islands exist, cooling costs are higher than normal. Strategies can be used to reduce heat islands and their effects.
(d) Stormwater management. Parking lots surfaces such as asphalt contribute to the degradation of local water quality. Parking lots can be more compatible environmentally if protection measures are incorporated into design standards and regulations. Porous pavement and grass pavers reduce runoff by allowing it to pass through the paved surface and infiltrate back into the soil and groundwater. Utilizing porous pavements and grass pavers also reduces or eliminates land dedicated to surface storm water management facilities. Porous pavement designs and grass pavers are appropriate in some instances. Other types of stormwater management facilities are environmentally compatible, such as vegetative swales and bioretention.
(e) Pedestrian mobility. Areas of paving are necessary to accommodate automobiles, but they can be unfriendly to pedestrians without specific regulations requiring that designers accommodate pedestrians. Large, open parking areas are conducive to high speeds and random maneuvers which can endanger pedestrians. Wide driveway aisles and access roads also increase speeds and discourage pedestrian travel. Street and parking lot design can balance the needs to accommodate automobile-centered standards with approaches that take into account the needs of pedestrians.
(f) Overbuilding of parking lots. Off-street parking requirements, as conventionally implemented, have resulted in excess, unnecessary parking around shopping centers and malls because it remains unused for most of the year. Parking lot construction is a considerable factor in the cost of development. Reducing parking areas reduces development costs. Therefore, reductions in the size of paved parking and flexibility in the types of pavement and parking designs are beneficial to all concerned.
(g) Connectivity. Abutting properties which do not provide interconnecting access to one another make it difficult, dangerous, and inefficient if not impossible, for motorists to travel between those properties. Between compatible uses, provisions requiring inter-parcel access meet substantial public purposes of convenience and safety.
Article 6, Access, Parking, and Loading, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
188
Sec. 6-2. Purposes.
The multiple purposes of this article are summarized as follows:
(a) Establish requirements for multi-modal access to development sites, including vehicular, truck service, and pedestrian, as appropriate;
(b) Establish on-site circulation patterns conducive to safe pedestrian as well as vehicular and truck access;
(c) Establish minimum off-street parking and loading areas in proportion to the need created by each use, but considering reductions for the provision of alternative modes of travel;
(d) Reduce congestion in the streets and ensure that uses and functions of public rights-of-ways are not interrupted;
(e) Establish certain maximum as well as minimum requirements for parking spaces to reduce development costs and ensure that excess impervious surfaces are not constructed, while providing for exceeding maximums when a demonstrated need exists. Parking requirements should be based on actual average parking demands, rather than to accommodate the highest hourly parking at a site;
(f) Provide for alternative pavement materials, such as porous asphalt, turf block, gravel, and cobbles which have higher degrees of water quality effectiveness than conventional asphalt and pervious concrete;
(g) Promote flexible approaches to the provision of off-street parking, including in some cases, as appropriate, use of on-street parking, shared parking arrangements, smaller spaces for compact cars, and unimproved or pervious pavement overflow or spillover parking areas;
(h) Establish design and improvement specifications for the development of parking lots, loading areas, access aisles, and connections of parking lots to public streets; and
(i) Promote and require inter-parcel access to facilitate movement of customers from business to business without generating additional turning movements on the public street, thus increasing public safety.
Sec. 6-3. Applicability.
(a) This article shall apply to all development; provided however, that within this article certain exceptions are made to specific sections or paragraphs.
Article 6, Access, Parking, and Loading, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
189
(b) This article shall not be construed as requiring compliance with this article of parking lots which lawfully existed on the effective date of this article; provided, however, that the community development director shall ensure parking lots that do not comply with this article meet the requirements of this article or substantially comply when a new development permit is required or a building permit is required to add additional building space on the site. If substantial redesign of the parking lot is required to comply with this article in such cases of new development or building additions, the community development director may accept substantial rather than complete compliance when the strict application of a requirement of this article would pose substantial practical difficulty.

Division III. On-site Circulation.
Sec. 6-41. Vehicular Circulation.
Efficient and easily recognized vehicular circulation routes within a development are vital and shall be provided. Internal vehicle circulation shall be designed or redesigned in a manner that avoids conflicts between through-traffic (i.e., traffic flowing into and out of the site) and local traffic (i.e., traffic through parking areas). Interior vehicular circulation shall be provided by the following means:
(a) Considering the entire parcel and its anticipated development, rather than simply a particular project, in formulating and approving access plans;
(b) Avoiding dead-end parking areas;
(c) Integrating service functions (e.g., deliveries, maintenance activities), when present or required as part of a development, into the circulation pattern in a manner which minimizes conflicts with vehicles and pedestrians; this includes the separation of service access and loading areas from main circulation and customer parking areas where possible;
(d) Visually orienting the driver with a regular, logical system of interior driveways and roadways;
(e) Identifying entrance drives with small entry signs; and
(f) Preventing vehicles from driving across or through designated parking areas by placing raised landscaped dividers or walkways between parking aisles.
Sec. 6-42. Pedestrian Facilities Internal to Site Required.
(a) Internal to each building site, non-single-family residential developments shall provide safe routes of pedestrian access between points of departure and destinations. Such provisions for pedestrian access shall be shown on plans, including site plans for development permits and building permits.
(b) When multiple buildings are proposed, they shall be linked with on-site pedestrian walkways.
(c) All walkways internal to the site shall be a minimum of 4 feet wide.
Article 6, Access, Parking, and Loading, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
197
(d) The internal sidewalk system shall connect to the public sidewalk system along streets and highways, where it exists or is planned. Where a transit stop exists, the internal sidewalk system shall provide as direct a link as possible from the buildings on site to the transit stop.
(e) When two or more parking lots aisles within a parking lot with more than 20 parking spaces are arranged perpendicular to the principal building on the property, one sidewalk or other approved pedestrian access way a minimum of four feet in width shall be required to be installed. Said sidewalks shall connect from the public right-of-way abutting the lot and extend the length of the parking aisle.
(f) Where pedestrian circulation crosses vehicular routes, a change in grade, materials, textures or colors, or appropriate striping or demarcation, shall be provided to emphasize the point of intersection between pedestrians and vehicles and improve its visibility and safety. For example, brick pavers and other special paving materials can help to distinguish pedestrian walkway surfaces from vehicular access ways.
Sec. 6-43. Inter-parcel Access.
(a) Required. Inter-parcel access for vehicles between abutting and nearby properties shall be provided so that access to individual properties can be achieved between adjacent and nearby developments as an alternative to forcing all movement onto abutting highways and public roads. Where opportunities for shared access have been identified by the community development director, developments must provide shared access with adjoining properties to facilitate vehicular and pedestrian connections between parcels.
(b) Easement. Easements are required to facilitate inter-parcel access between any office, retail sales or services use, and another abutting office, retail sales or services use or lot that is zoned for office, retail sales or services use. The inter-parcel access easement shall permit automobile and pedestrian access from the adjoining property to driveways and parking areas intended for customer or tenant use, but parking spaces may be restricted to use by the owners customers and tenants only. The granting of such easement shall be effective only upon the granting of a reciprocal easement by the abutting property owner.
(c) Connection. Upon the availability of access to driveways and parking areas of the abutting lot, the pavement or other surfacing of each owners driveways and parking areas shall be extended by each owner to the point of access on the property line.
(d) Location of inter-parcel connections. The location of vehicular connections across a property line shall be mutually determined and constructed by both property owners. Connection of parking areas for vehicular access may be provided in the front portion of the site. In cases where it is not possible to provide the connection in front, it may be provided in the rear portion of the site. In the case of coordination problems or any factors preventing construction of an inter-parcel connection, the community development director will determine the location of the inter-parcel connection to be constructed by property owners, subject to appeal as an administrative decision.
Article 6, Access, Parking, and Loading, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
198
(e) Waiver. The community development director may waive the requirements of this section if he or she finds that it is unnecessary to provide inter-parcel access due to the unlikelihood of patrons traveling among two or more existing or proposed uses on abutting or nearby sites. The Mayor and City Council is authorized to waive in whole or in part the requirement for an inter-parcel access easement, upon application for a variance in accordance with this development code, in the event an administrative variance is not granted by the community development director.
[Secs. 6-44 to 6-50 Reserved].

Division VI. Off-Street Parking Reduction.
Sec. 6-81. Administrative Variances.
(a) The minimum and maximum on-site parking requirements for uses in the CBD zoning district may be waived by the community development director upon a determination that adequate parking is otherwise available.
(b) The community development director may allow parking at a rate of up to 10 percent above the maximum permitted number of spaces, or at a rate of no more than 20 percent below the minimum required, on a case-by-case basis, based upon the scale and impacts of the request, for good cause shown. The applicant shall make said request in writing which may be required to include documentation from an acceptable industry publication (e.g., Institute of Transportation Engineers, Urban Land Institute, American Planning Association, etc.) or a study prepared by a qualified professional that documents parking requirements.
(c) The community development director may authorize a reduction of a number of required parking spaces when it can be demonstrated to his or her satisfaction that the use provides other areas on the site that are not marked as parking spaces but which serve some of the demand for on-site parking.
(d) In approving administrative variances to the parking requirements of this section, the community development director may as a condition of approval, if applicable, require an area to be reserved or set-aside for additional parking area for future use if needed.
Sec. 6-82. Off-site Parking.
If required parking spaces are not located on the same lot as the particular use, building or establishment they are intended to serve, the following shall apply:
(a) The parking spaces must be located on a property that has the same zoning classification as the property that the spaces serve, or a less restrictive zoning classification.
(b) No required parking spaces may be located across any State or U.S. highway from the use they are intended to serve.
(c) An easement (or other recordable instrument satisfactory to the community development director) dedicating the off-site parking to the property that the spaces serve shall be recorded with the Clerk of the Superior Court and a copy provided to the community development director. The document must be written to survive future changes in ownership in perpetuity, unless the agreement is dissolved with approval by the Mayor and City Council.
(d) Off-site parking spaces shall be located in proximity to the use that the spaces serve, in accordance with the locational requirements of Table 6-3.
Article 6, Access, Parking, and Loading, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
210
Sec. 6-83. Shared Use of Parking Spaces.
The parking spaces provided for separate uses may be combined in one parking lot but the required spaces assigned to each use may not be assigned to another use, except as follows:
(a) Shared parking between day and night users. One-half of the parking spaces assigned to a church, theater, or assembly hall whose peak attendance will be at night or on Sundays may be assigned to a use that will be closed at night or on Sundays.
(b) Mixed use developments. Parking spaces may be shared by more than one use if the community development director finds that the total number of spaces will be adequate at the peak hours of the uses they serve. The ratios shown on Table 6-6 may be used in determining the time of day and the day of the week at which the maximum number of spaces will be needed by the uses served by the shared parking facility.

Parking spaces that are proposed to be shared among two or more uses must be clearly available to each use and not appear in any way to be serving a particular use, either through signage dedicating the spaces or through design techniques that would tend to orient use of the spaces to a particular business or building.
(d) Recordation of shared parking agreement. Shared parking arrangements must be committed to writing in an instrument acceptable to the community development director, and approved by the owners of each of the affected properties or uses. The instrument must be approved by the community development director and shall be recorded with the Clerk of Superior Court, and a copy of the recorded document must be supplied to the community development director. The document must be written to survive future changes in ownership in perpetuity, unless the agreement is dissolved with approval by the Mayor and City Council.
Sec. 6-84. Reduction for On-street Parking.
The community development director may in individual cases administratively authorize a reduction in the minimum number of parking spaces for projects that are directly served by on-
Article 6, Access, Parking, and Loading, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
211
street parking approved by the public works director, on a one-to-one basis (one off-street parking space reduced for each on-street parking space directly serving the subject development). In such instances on-street parking shall be counted toward meeting minimum on-site parking space requirements.
Sec. 6-85. Reduction for Mixed-Use Development.
In the MXU zoning district, when developed for mixed uses, the minimum total required parking spaces specified for the combination in uses may be reduced by 10%.
Sec. 6-86. Reduction for Demand Management.
(a) The community development director may in individual cases administratively authorize a proportional reduction in the required minimum number of parking spaces for office, institutional, industrial, and public uses with 50 or more employee parking spaces, if a formal carpool or van pool program is instituted.
(b) For purposes of this section, carpool is defined as 2 or more persons per car, and vanpool is defined as 5 or more persons per van. Any carpool or vanpool program shall provide at least 5 spaces reserved for carpool or vanpool vehicles and shall be clearly marked Reserved  Carpool/Vanpool Only through signage or pavement markings.
(c) Designated carpool/vanpool spaces shall be the closest employee parking spaces to the building entrance normally used by employees except for any handicapped parking spaces provided.
(d) The applicant must agree that the parking preferences will be enforced.
Sec. 6-87. Use Division of Large Parking Lots.
When a parking lot of 75 spaces or an area of one acre or more of parking is proposed, the applicant may be required by the community development director to divide the parking lot into distinct use areas as provided in Table 6-7 for purposes of applying impervious surface reduction and water quality infiltration techniques.

Division I. Findings.
Sec. 7-1. Beneficial Functions.
(a) Signs provide a means of communication, a visual, place-based medium by which to express messages. Signs and advertising devices facilitate and aid in the identification and location of business establishments, institutions, and other land uses. Signs can be an effective, easily available, and cost-efficient way to inform people and aid their decision-making. Signs are an investment that brings economic value to businesses. Signs provide a means for attracting consumers who are not otherwise familiar with the geographic area. Signs provide assistance in individuals making selections from among alternative choices. Signs help certain locations work from a profitability standpoint that otherwise might fail without adequate signage.
(b) Signs derive their value in part from public improvements. Businesses exist and prosper in part because consumers have access to their locations via public rights-of-ways. Businesses locate, and signs are erected, because of the facilitation of access the community provides to business locations. The public way creates much of the value for the person or establishment erecting the sign, and visibility from the public way is what creates the problems which give rise to the need for sign controls. Because the public way contributes to value, the public therefore has a right, and indeed an obligation, to control the problems that arise from creating that opportunity and value.
Sec. 7-2. Regulation of Messaging.
Signage is a form of advertising. All other advertising mediums are regulated. There is limited federal and state regulation of signs, despite significant intervention by the federal government in the regulation of other forms of communication. Signage is a type of advertising that cannot be turned off or rejected by the consumer, like some other forms of communication. For instance, radio and television advertisements can be avoided by turning off the radio or television. With regard to signs, however, motorists must keep eyes open to drive and cannot block out signs from their peripheral vision. Absent federal and significant state regulation, it is in the public interest for the city to control signage.
Article 7, Signs and Advertising Devices, Powder Springs, GA, Unified Development Code
217
Sec. 7-3. Public Safety.
(a) Signs by their very nature are intended to gain the attention of motorists and therefore distract them from the primary purpose of maneuvering a vehicle along a road. Signs, if unregulated, can confuse motorists by mimicking traffic safety signals and signs. Motorists might confuse signs that contain flashing or blinking red, green, or yellow lights with roadway traffic signals. Signs constructed of shapes like an octagonal stop sign might also impair public safety by confusing the motorist. Therefore, there is a substantial public purpose served in prohibiting signs that mimic or would be confused with traffic safety signals and signs. Unregulated signs can also degrade the utility and reduce the visibility and effectiveness of public safety signs. The regulation of signs is needed to ensure that signs can be read for their many beneficial purposes but in a way that does not impair visibility or cause traffic accidents.
(b) Sign regulations achieve public safety purposes not achieved by building codes. Without regulations, signs can pose a clear danger to public safety. It has long been recognized that sign controls are needed to promote traffic safety and avoid traffic accidents. Signs erected too close to a road can impair visibility and can cause traffic accidents. If signs are not regulated with regard to placement, height, size, and other physical attributes, they can interfere with the sight of motorists exiting a driveway onto a public road. It is necessary to regulate the time, placement, and manner of signs for public safety purposes.
(c) Addressing of places and other means of locating establishments are essential to police, fire, and other emergency responders. Signage, if left unregulated, can cause confusion and delay in responding to emergencies.
(d) Limitations placed on signs erected on storefront windows can increase visibility from outside the establishment and may help deter crime and robberies. Sign controls that limit the amount of storefront window and door areas that can be covered with signs enhance visibility of activities within the store or building. Limits on window signs can provide for an appropriate minimum visibility from the exterior and can increase public safety of commercial areas through a reduction in crime potential.
(e) Electronic multiple message signs, which allow operators to change content from remote locations in a matter of seconds, have been shown to create possible threats to public safety. Such signs are erected for the purpose of trying to hold the attention of motorists by changing messages and pictures for short durations using a series of bright, colorful images produced mainly via LED (light emitting diode) technologies. Brightly lit and colorful signs that change messages every few seconds compel motorists to notice them, and they lure the attention of motorists away from what is happening on the road and onto the sign. Such signs pose public safety threats because if they attract a motorists attention, the motorist will look at the sign and not at the road. Electronic multiple message signs are also a threat to public safety because of their brightness, making them visible from great distances. Due to their nature of brightness, changing colors, and changing displays, electronic multiple message signs are more distracting than signs
Article 7, Signs and Advertising Devices, Powder Springs, GA, Unified Development Code
218
which do not vary the brightness, color or message, or multiple message signs that are changed by other means at less frequent intervals. Some electronic multiple message signs could, if unregulated, have the appearance of large, plasma-screen televisions. An electronic LED display contains brightly-lit text and graphics which can be seen from hundreds of feet away, drawing the attention of everyone within view. Unless otherwise regulated, such displays can be extremely bright since they are designed to be visible in bright sunlight and at night. Furthermore, the human eye is drawn to them far more strongly than to traditional illuminated signs. It can take six seconds for a person to comprehend the message on an electronic sign, which is considered three times the safe period for driver distraction.
Sec. 7-4. Public Health.
Unregulated signage can contribute to clutter and lack of organization in the wayfinding system of a community and thereby negatively influence the stress levels of motorists. Roadside blight can contribute to high stress levels of motorists (Source: Meg Maguire, Ray Foote, and Frank Vespe, 1997, Beauty As Well As Bread, Journal of the American Planning Association 63(3): 317-328). Height, size, placement, and other sign regulations serve substantial public purposes of bringing order to the wayfinding system that may help to avoid undue stress levels of motorists.
Sec. 7-5. Reduction and Mitigation of Adverse Impacts on Adjacent Properties.
The size, height, construction materials, location, condition, and attributes of signs can have an impact on surrounding and nearby land uses and properties. Signs can have adverse impacts on adjacent properties if not regulated and properly maintained, including the lowering of property values. Abandoned and antiquated signs and sign structures (e.g., a pole with a blank structure for a sign face) can have a particularly detrimental effect on adjacent properties and contribute to an overall image of blight in the community.
Sec. 7-6. Prevention of Adverse Impacts on Community Character and Attractiveness.
(a) Sign regulations promote and ensure the aesthetics of the community. The concept of public welfare is broad and inclusive, and the values it represents are spiritual as well as physical, aesthetic as well as monetary. Sign regulations serve the substantial public purposes of ensuring that the community is beautiful as well as healthy, spacious as well as clean, well balanced as well as carefully controlled (Source: Berman v Parker 348 U.S. 26, 75 S. Ct. 98, 99 L. Ed. 27 1954).
(b) Appearance of a community, which is substantially influenced by signs, is essential to the citys long-term economic viability. Signs and advertising, without regulation, can detract from the character, beauty, and visual attractiveness of the city. Unregulated signage and advertising devices can mar scenic landscapes and impair other visual qualities of the city. Visual blight adversely affects the aesthetic quality of life and traffic safety in the community for residents, businesses, pedestrians, and motorists.
Article 7, Signs and Advertising Devices, Powder Springs, GA, Unified Development Code
219
(c) The city has great interest in maintaining and enhancing the aesthetic environment. Regulations are needed to ensure that signs are compatible with the surroundings and do not detract from the character of particular districts. The regulation of signage according to different zoning districts is therefore an acceptable way of ensuring character and attractiveness are maintained. Sign controls, including regulations that go beyond size, height, location, and manner restrictions, are necessary to improve the visual character and quality of life of the community.
Sec. 7-7. Protection of Public Investments.
Unregulated signs adversely impact public investments. Sign regulations help to assure that public benefits derived from expenditures of public funds for the improvement and beautification of streets and other public structures and spaces are protected. Unregulated signs can neutralize the value and benefit of public investments in streetscapes.
Sec. 7-8. Promotion and Maintenance of Private Investments.
Sign regulations benefit businesses that seek to advertise. Unregulated commercial signage can be detrimental to individual businesses, because business owners may be compelled to erect larger and more costly signs to outperform neighboring or nearby businesses. Such competition for visibility among business can result in too many signs and excessive sizes, to a point of diminishing returns where individual business signs are not adequately visible. If unregulated, the competition for visual recognition can defeat the purpose of the signs, which is to carry a message, often a commercial one. If signs are left unregulated, patrons of individual businesses may miss their destinations because they cannot find the particular business of choice in the sea of advertising devices.
[Secs. 7-9 and 7-10 Reserved].
Division II. Supplemental Findings, Intentions, and Explanations.
Sec. 7-11. Viewshed is Subject to Regulation.
This article is intended to apply to all signs and advertising devices that are or are intended to be viewed from a public right-of-way or adjacent property, or that are intended to be viewed from outdoor areas of public property, except as otherwise specifically stated in this article.
Sec. 7-12. Content Neutrality.
(a) The city intends to adopt regulations which are content-neutral. It is not the intent to regulate the content of messages in any way. To accomplish this, these regulations do not distinguish between on-site or off-site sign content, nor do they distinguish between commercial and non-commercial content. It is the intent of this article to allow political, religious, or personal (non-commercial) messages on any sign permitted to be erected by this article.
Article 7, Signs and Advertising Devices, Powder Springs, GA, Unified Development Code
220
(b) For a sign code to be content neutral, it is necessary to define all signs in terms of something other than the content of the message displayed on a given sign, such as its location. If in applying a sign regulation it is necessary to read the content of the sign to determine whether the sign is lawful or not, the sign regulation has failed to achieve content neutrality.
(c) The principle of content neutrality runs counter to most peoples thought processes, as they usually will have in mind a particular purpose when they want to erect a sign or ask for a sign permit. For instance, one person may wish to express a message unrelated to business or commerce (non-commercial speech), while business owners are trying to attract customers, identify their products, and perhaps assist other businesses or landowners in identification and location. A sign code must provide for commercial and noncommercial speech, even though it is considered wise not to distinguish between the two in the regulations themselves, since to make that distinction one would have to read the message to determine whether it is commercial or noncommercial speech. It is widely recognized that how sign regulations treat noncommercial speech in relation to commercial speech is subject to scrutiny by courts, given the constitutional right to free speech.
Sec. 7-13. Time, Placement, and Manner Restrictions.
It is the intent of this article to regulate the composition, type, location, placement, height, size, illumination, and the duration of signs and advertising devices that may be displayed. In adopting these sign regulations, the Mayor and Council especially recognizes the vast number of court decisions, coming from Georgia courts, the federal courts, and courts throughout the United States, which recognize that the regulation of the size, location and quantity of sign structures is a valid and lawful means of achieving the intentions and purposes of this article, and that such intentions and purposes are valid and lawful governmental interests. The regulations contained herein are no more extensive than necessary to serve the substantial governmental interests identified in this article.
Sec. 7-14. Noncommercial and Commercial Messages.
In imposing sign regulations, all landowners need to be equally protected in terms of expression of noncommercial messages. Landowners and occupants have the right to free speech, including political speech, even when there is no election upcoming. One would not expect commercial messages to be needed on a lot used exclusively for residential purposes. This means that sign regulations for residential zoning districts can more or less prevent signage to accommodate commercial messages, but yet those restrictions must respect first amendment rights to free speech and also accommodate nonresidential uses that may exist or are allowed in residential zoning districts. A sign code can protect the rights to noncommercial speech by not specifying the content of messages  thus any sign allowed by a given ordinance could display a noncommercial message, even if such sign is most likely going to be used to identify a business or establishment, or provide direction to such establishments on or off-site.
Article 7, Signs and Advertising Devices, Powder Springs, GA, Unified Development Code
221
Sec. 7-15. Variation Required.
Not all lots, parcels, or properties are equal when it comes to the need for signs. Signs along state highways are generally greater in area and height not only because of the desire to allow commercial messages but also because motorist travel speeds (i.e., posted speed limits) are typically greater than in residential neighborhoods. There is evidence that larger signs are needed for legibility and visibility on state highways given their greater motor vehicle speeds (i.e., less time to view a message) and greater width of the right of way, which increases distance of the motorist to sign messages and thus decreases legibility and visibility.
Sec. 7-16. Regulation by Zoning District.
The zoning district is an appropriate means of regulating signs, because generally a character is established by each zoning district (see the citys adopted comprehensive plan). The needs for signage differ remarkably among single-family residential zoning districts from zoning districts allowing business, which in turn differ significantly from business parks, low-rise office complexes, and industrial establishments. Greater sign heights and areas are appropriate in business and industrial zones when compared with residential zoning districts.
Sec. 7-17. Proportionality.
The relationship of sign characteristics (area and height, for example), especially wall signs, to the building on which it is attached is very important in terms of aesthetics. Without regulation, signage placed on walls can be too large in proportion to the building façade. Similarly, sign codes need to accommodate the differences in size, scale, and height of different buildings. For instance, if an absolute maximum sign area is established, it may be appropriate proportionally for a certain size of building but inappropriate (too small and also out of proportion) to a very large building. For this reason, it is appropriate to regulate wall signage on the basis of the percentage of area of the building façade. Similar, a proportionality regulation is considered appropriate for window signage. An industrial establishment, with large wall areas, does not have the same needs as a commercial establishment in this regard and is appropriately limited to a smaller percentage of wall area used for signs and advertising than a commercial establishment.
Sec. 7-18. Rationale for Sign Allowances.
(a) In addition to regulation by zoning district, by which sign height and maximum sign area are distinguishable, the uses permitted within zoning districts can range from residential, to institutional, commercial and industrial land uses. Sometimes, non-residential uses are permitted in residential zones, and sign regulations need to account for the needs to identify such nonresidential establishments in residential zoning districts, but yet ensure that such signs are compatible by way of height and area appropriate to a residentially zoned area. The regulations adopted in this ordinance distinguish between different land uses and assign different sign permissions based on such land use. For instance, signage allowances differ among a lot with a single dwelling, a lot containing a single non-
Article 7, Signs and Advertising Devices, Powder Springs, GA, Unified Development Code
222
residential principal permitted use (which can occur in virtually any zoning district), and a lot containing more than one permitted principal use or more than one building (such as shopping centers and office parks). The regulations also define allowable signage for vacant lots.
(b) Residential uses do not require identification other than by street address. However, non-residential uses, whether in residential or nonresidential zoning districts, usually do require identification of some sort. This is why a principal use ground sign is allowed for nonresidential but not for single-family residential uses; while intended to serve primarily establishment identification needs, principal use ground signs are not limited in the message and therefore may be used in total or in part to carry a noncommercial message. Each land use type, including vacant lots, are permitted an accessory ground sign  which is intended to allow for reasonable noncommercial speech for each lot owner or resident. For nonresidential land uses, the need for accessory messaging is greater than for lots with single dwellings, and therefore, more than one accessory ground sign is allowed.
(c) With regard to wall signage, there is no need to have signs attached to single dwellings, but nonresidential establishments have the need to identify uses within buildings. This is why a residential dwelling does not allow wall signs (other than that described for temporary durations in the event of lease or sale), while nonresidential uses regardless of zoning district are allowed wall and window signage proportional to the building or area within which a sign can be placed.
Sec. 7-19. Real Estate-Related Messages.
Although a content neutral sign code cannot describe and regulate signs related to the sale or lease of real estate, the sign code must still accommodate these needs. The needs of lot and building or leased space owners to market the sale and lease of properties and buildings can be accommodated with a duration-type sign allowance  i.e., a special sign allowance during the time a lot, building, or part of building is for sale or lease. The sign regulations therefore provide for signs advertising a building or lot for sale or for lease, during the time such lot or building or portion thereof is for sale or lease; these regulations accommodate such signage needs as ground signs as well as wall and window signs.
Sec. 7-20. Sign Prohibitions.
Given the objectives of the city, it is appropriate to prohibit signs and other advertising devices where if used frequently by multiple businesses would create an appearance of clutter, information overload, and distractions to motorist safety. Certain advertising devices such as wind-blown or air-blown devices create movement that distracts motorists and such devices are not fundamentally necessary to attract customers in light of other signage and advertising allowances.
Article 7, Signs and Advertising Devices, Powder Springs, GA, Unified Development Code
223
Sec. 7-21. Billboards.
Due to their large areas, billboards are inherently incompatible with the goals and objectives for development and community character as established in the citys adopted comprehensive plan. Because this sign ordinance allows for any type of message on any type of lawful sign, it is unnecessary to allow large signs that are inconsistent with the citys desired character and not fundamentally necessary in terms of providing additional opportunity for messages that may be classified informally as off site. The purposes served by billboards are reasonably accommodated by other signs, but with smaller areas and at lower heights than would be accomplished with billboards. The city recognizes that billboards that exist, even though they may not be in compliance with the citys sign allowances, can be continued and cannot be amortized per federal law and/or court cases.
Sec. 7-22. Illumination.
The city recognizes that the lighting of signs has a significant effect on the character of districts. A number of problems with external lighting have long been recognized, including light trespass, light pollution, sky glow, and brightness and glare which can detract from drivers during hours of darkness. In addition, the city finds that signs which are internally illuminated create an appearance of a nonresidential or business area which is inappropriate in residential zones. It is reasonable and appropriate to establish regulations for the lighting of signs depending on zoning district and also based on the type of sign. There is no compelling reason why signs of a temporary nature should be or need to be illuminated. Multiple message electronic signs pose unique challenges regarding the visual environment and traffic safety unless regulated. It is appropriate for aesthetics, compatibility, and other objectives as well as for energy purposes that lighted signs be restricted from utilizing lighting, when the establishment is not open.
Sec. 7-23. Advertising for Special Events.
Certain advertising devices, such as banners or inflatable signs, are not normally appropriate given the objectives of the city to maintain aesthetics and to prevent inappropriate competition among establishments for attention. While it is appropriate to disallow the general use of air-blown devices, banners, and inflatable signs, it is considered appropriate in the city to permit businesses and establishments to occasionally use such advertising devices, typically for a limited duration for special events such as grand openings and going out of business sales.
Sec. 7-24. Flags.
Flying the American flag is one of the most fundamental rights of every person in the United States. Federal protections have been instigated to protect that right. It is not the intent to prevent the display of the American flag on any sign, although it is also appropriate to restrict the use of flags as an advertising medium. The city finds that the flying of flags, whether the nations flag or any other, can be abused. Specifically, businesses, in an effort to outdo their competitors or to stand out in the complex visual environment of messaging, will sometimes install flags on light posts or place multiple small flags along street frontages. Other businesses may, if unregulated,
Article 7, Signs and Advertising Devices, Powder Springs, GA, Unified Development Code
224
choose to fly uncolored flags in multiple locations just to gain attention. These situations are not considered responsible displays of the American flag and are considered abuses for advertising purposes. The use of flags as an advertising or attention-attracting medium deserves regulation. Accordingly, it is appropriate to regulate flags, including colored flags without sign copy, to ensure the citys various objectives are met, while at the same time safeguarding the rights of individuals, establishments, and property owners to demonstrate allegiance to the nation, a state, a city or a private establishment. The regulations pertaining to the size, height, and manner of displaying flags is intended to permit such expressions of allegiances while preventing the potential abuses. The copy or content of flags is not regulated by this article.
Sec. 7-25. Sign Maintenance.
The city finds that signs, if improperly maintained, present an unkempt appearance and may present an image of blight to visitors, residents, and employees. It is in the interest of the city to ensure that signs are properly maintained to avoid the appearance of blight and also to prevent possible detrimental impact on property values that may result from such blight.
Sec. 7-26. Architectural Review.
In some parts of cities, such as neighborhoods or business areas containing buildings of historic or cultural significance, the impact of signage on aesthetics and character is more intense and of even greater concern to the city. Historic and downtown business districts, to maintain character, need special scrutiny with regard to the materials and appearance of signs. Accordingly, it is appropriate to require architectural review of signs in order to maintain and enhance the harmony and character of the visual setting of such district or districts.
Sec. 7-27. Regulatory Relief.
It is acknowledged that no set of sign regulations can anticipate all situations relative to sign needs. It is further acknowledged that sign regulations may impose undue burdens on property owners and occupants. Accordingly, it is appropriate to have a procedure, in the form of a variance permission, which can bring relief from strict sign regulations when conditions warrant such relief be granted.

Model Code for Regulation of On-Premise Signs.
(d) No sign projecting more than 4 inches from a building wall (projecting sign), if
permitted, shall be placed less than 8 feet above the finished elevation of the ground,
sidewalk, or other pavement surface.
Sec. 7-46. Sign Number by Sign Type.
(a) Sign allowances are based on zoning district and use within the zoning district and also in
some cases depending on the number of property frontages. The number of signs of a
particular type shall not exceed the maximum established for such signs for the use and
the zoning district in which it is located, as provided in Table 7-2, Maximum Number
and Area of Signs by Use Type by Zoning District. Unless specifically provided
otherwise in Table 7.2, a property shall be limited to only one sign of the type permitted.
Article 7, Signs and Advertising Devices, Powder Springs, GA, Unified Development Code
238
(b) With regard to wall sign allowances, if a building, structure, or freestanding canopy faces more than one road frontage, each wall facing a road frontage shall be permitted to have the wall sign area specified for such building.
(c) When this article permits 1 sign for each road frontage, the sign number allowance allotted to 1 road frontage shall not be transferred to another road frontage.
Sec. 7-47. Sign Area.
a) Maximum. The area of any sign of a particular type shall not exceed the maximum established for such type of signs for the use and the zoning district in which it is located, as provided in Table 7-2, Maximum Number and Area of Signs by Use Type by Zoning District. The maximum square footages in Table 7-2 are for one face of a sign. A ground sign may consist of 1 or more faces, provided all such sign faces are attached to or integrated into 1 sign structure.
b) Wall signs. For a building containing more than one business or identifiable establishment, wall signage allowances shall be calculated separately for each tenant space on the basis of signable area of that portion of the front building wall devoted to tenant space use. When a building contains more than 1 wall for which signage is regulated by this article, the maximum sign areas established in this article shall be applied to each wall associated with the tenant space. Wall signage area allowances established by this article may be distributed among more than 1 sign.
c) Canopy signs. The maximum sign area for a canopy sign shall be 50% of the signable area of the side of the canopy on which the sign is integrated.
Sec 7-48. Computation of Sign Area.
(a) Address display on signs. The display of street address on a ground sign, wall, or window shall not be computed in determining the maximum allowable area of a ground, wall, or window sign, respectively; provided that it is separate and distinguishable from any sign copy. In no event shall letters for addresses exceed 9 inches in height on a ground sign or 18 inches in height if mounted to a wall, door, or glass window.
(b) Double-faced signs. For double-faced signs, only 1 display face shall be measured in computing sign area when the sign faces are parallel, or where the interior angle formed by the faces is 60 degrees or less. If the 2 faces of a double-faced sign are of unequal area, the sign area shall be taken as the area of the larger face.
(c) Wall signs. For a wall sign, the sign area shall be the area within a continuous rectangular perimeter enclosing the limits of each separate writing, representation, emblem, message, or any figure or similar character, together with any frame or other material or color forming an integral part of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the background against which it is placed; provided, however, that any open space
Article 7, Signs and Advertising Devices, Powder Springs, GA, Unified Development Code
239
contained within the rectangular perimeter (such as between letters in a word) or between any component panel, strip, or figure of any kind composing the sign shall be included in the computation of the sign area whether this open space be enclosed or not by a frame or border.
Sec. 7-49. Description of Sign Type Allowances (Table 7-2).
Table 7-2 shows several variables that are best explained in text as a supplement to Table 7-2.
(a) Number of street frontages. The number of signs generally follows the rationale that a property owner with more than 1 property frontage (abutting a street) may have signs on both frontages, whereas a property owner with only 1 street frontage would be allowed only 1 such sign.
(b) Type of street frontage. Local streets have lower posted speeds and lower driving speeds when compared with state routes. Table 7-2 provides larger areas for certain signs for lots fronting on state routes, because posted speed limits and driving speeds are generally higher than those established for local streets.
(c) Vacant or undeveloped lot. One distinction made in Table 7-2 is whether the property is developed or undeveloped. Vacant properties have some sign allowance, under the premise that the regulation must provide for the property owner to express opinion or provide information. Additional signage on a vacant lot is allowed during the time the land is for sale, rent, or lease, or under construction, as it is on developed lots as well.
(d) Number of buildings. The sign allowances in Table 7-2 vary based on the number of buildings on the lot and the use of the building. Lots containing more than one permitted principal use, or more than one building, have different sign allowances than lots with a single building.
(e) Zoning district. The sign allowances in Table 7-2 vary the allowable area of certain signs based on zoning district. The purposes of that variation is to seek proportionality and compatibility with respect to the neighborhood, area character, and adjacent or nearby land uses. The area allowances reflect an intent to maintain a pedestrian-scale with respect to signs in residential, mixed use, and other zoning districts, while permitting signs with greater area in community commercial and industrial areas. Note that a particular use shown in Table 7-2 may not be permitted in a particular zoning district shown in Table 7-2, even though the table provides sign allowances for the same.

Article 7, Signs and Advertising Devices, Powder Springs, GA, Unified Development Code
242
and shall remain only until the time a wall sign is erected more or less in its place. In no case shall said banner remain on the site for longer than 60 days.
Sec. 7-62. Drive-through Lanes.
Drive-through lanes may have a maximum of two display boards not exceeding 6 feet in height or 36 square feet in area.
Sec. 7-63. Flags.

For purposes of this paragraph, dissolve shall mean a mode of message transition on a multiple message electronic sign accomplished by varying the light intensity or pattern, where the first message gradually appears to dissipate and lose legibility simultaneously with the gradual appearance and legibility of the subsequent message.
(g) Lighting and brightness limitations. The lighting intensity of any multiple message electronic sign, whether resulting from internal or external illumination, shall not exceed 60 foot candles when measured with a standard light meter held at a distance of ten inches from the sign face. The maximum brightness level for LED signs during daylight hours shall not exceed 5,000 nits (candles per square meter) when measured at the signs face at its maximum brightness and 500 nits when measured at the signs face at its maximum brightness between dusk and dawn. LED signs shall be required to have an automatic dimming function to reduce brightness to prescribed levels at dusk. The owner of the parcel on which a multiple message electronic sign is placed shall submit certification from an electrical engineer or other qualified professional that all requirements of this subsection are met, along with supporting documentation ensuring said certification.

A property owner may reapply for the same sign which was previously denied a sign permit, in order to secure permission for a sign which complies with this article and applicable building and electrical codes. An applicant may appeal the denial of a sign permit in accordance with the provisions for appeals of administrative decisions, as specified in this development code.
Sec. 7-97. Procedures for Architectural Review of Signs.
No sign requiring a sign permit shall be erected, and no sign permit shall be issued for a sign that requires a sign permit in the CBD zoning district or for a development or building that requires architectural review per this development code, until or unless the architectural characteristics, materials, and composition of such sign have been approved by the department of community development. Architectural review if required shall occur during the sign permitting process, if a sign permit is required.
The community development department shall consider the following, which shall not be limiting, in issuing approvals of architectural characteristics for signs and may use these criteria in determining whether to approve, deny, or modify said signs:
Article 7, Signs and Advertising Devices, Powder Springs, GA, Unified Development Code
250
(a) Construction. The proposed sign is composed of materials that are compatible with the materials of the face of the building façade where it is placed or to which it pertains. Principal use ground signs for commercial developments shall be monument signs. Exposed surfaces of signs must be constructed of or appear to be constructed of metal, glass, stone, concrete, brick, cloth, or wood, or similar approved material. Plastic substrate, plywood, or unfinished wood are not appropriate materials for signs and shall not be permitted.
(b) Compatibility. The scale, size, and shape of the sign are proportional to the building on which they are placed or to which it pertains and the area in which it is located. Further, the design, lettering, and composition of the sign are compatible with the building and other materials in the district. To this end, the community development department may find that a sign is out of character with the area or not proportional to the building, activity or use and may work with the sign permit applicant to reduce the scale, size, shape, or placement of the sign or signs. However, the department shall not have authority to limit the area of a sign to less than the maximum permitted by this article, without agreement by the sign permit applicant.
(c) Wall sign locations. Appropriate locations for wall signage on buildings with more than one story shall be in the lintel space which separates the storefront from the upper floor, and the space above the transom in the storefront, where one exists. Wall signs should be located on flat, unadorned parts of the building façade, somewhere above storefront display windows (where they exist) and below second-story windows (where they exist). If the building façade or storefront has a lintel strip or signboard, the wall sign should be placed directly on it. Wall signs should be located centrally on the façade.
(d) Wall sign rhythm and proportionality. If the sign proposed is a wall sign, it establishes an appropriate rhythm and is proportional to the façade.
Source: Escondido, California, Downtown Specific Plan Sign Criteria & Guidelines
(e) Awning and storefront canopy signs. Awning signs should be silk-screened or sewn onto the awning fabric, and they should be placed on the valance of the awning. Signs on canopies should be located on the primary face or top edge (or front-angled or sloped part) of canopies. Back-lit canopy signs shall not be permitted except as otherwise specifically provided by this article.
Article 7, Signs and Advertising Devices, Powder Springs, GA, Unified Development Code
251
(f) Suspended signs. Suspended signs may be
permitted in pedestrian retail districts.
(g) Colors. No individual sign shall have more than three
colors. Colors of signs should be coordinated with
overall building colors. White or other light-colored
backgrounds for signs should not be proposed.
Source: Escondido, California, Downtown
Specific Plan Sign Criteria & Guidelines
(h) Shape. Signs should typically be square or
rectangular; provided, however, this shall not
prevent individual signs that may be circular or
some other shape, or shaped like a particular
object (e.g., a sign in the shape of a shoe for a
shoe store).

Division VIII. Sign Maintenance, Removal, and Enforcement.
Sec. 7-101. Maintenance.
a) All signs, together with all their supports, braces, guys, and anchors shall be kept in good
repair. Property owners of a sign in need of maintenance, as defined in this article, shall
be responsible for promptly maintaining such sign in good repair.
b) Except for nonconforming signs, replacing or altering the words, letters, figures, symbols,
logos, fixtures, colors, or other design elements that compose an existing signs message,
in whole or in part, shall be considered to be either maintenance or a lawful change in the
copy of said sign and such replacement or altering of existing sign copy does not require
a sign permit when the sign panel or sign structure itself is not changed.
c) Painting and cleaning of a sign shall be considered maintenance and shall not require a
sign permit.
Article 7, Signs and Advertising Devices, Powder Springs, GA, Unified Development Code
252
Sec. 7-102. Removal.
Derelict signs, and any signs erected without proper authorization in street rights of ways, or on private property alongside a right of way that constitute a safety hazard, may be removed from placement in such locations by city personnel.
Sec. 7-103. Enforcement of Sign Maintenance.
In cases of a sign in need of maintenance, the department of community development shall notify property owners and sign owners of the need to maintain signs. If a condition of sign in need of maintenance still exists for more than 30 calendar days after the date such notification was mailed, the department of community development or other city designee for enforcement shall issue a notice of violation and compliance order to the property owner and if different, the sign owner.
Sec. 7-104. Discontinued Signs.
(a) If a principal use or activity on a property has ceased operation, any permanent ground signs including supports, and wall signs, permitted in connection with said principal use or activity shall be removed within 90 days of the discontinuance of said principal use or activity; provided, however, that a property owner with a significant investment in a sign structure that may be reused for another activity within 1 year, may retain the sign structure in compliance with this section.
(b) If a discontinued principal use ground or wall sign contains a sign face that is in the form of a removable panel, the panel containing advertising shall be removed and replaced with a panel without sign copy until another principal use is established and a sign permit if required is issued for a new principal use ground or wall sign. The purpose of this provision is to prevent the image of blight associated with a sign structure that has had the copy or sign panel removed, leaving interior supports of the sign structure exposed to public view.
(c) If a discontinued principal use monument sign contains a sign copy area that is not removable without disassembling the monument, then the sign copy area shall be painted over if possible, or, where it cannot be painted over, covered with durable cloth or canvas so that the sign copy and/or underlying structure which was permitted in connection with the business or activity discontinued is no longer visible, until such time as a new sign permit, if required, is applied for and granted, or approved sign copy is affixed on the sign copy area of said monument.
Sec. 7-105. Enforcement of Illegal Signs.
In addition to enforcement mechanisms permissible with regard to violations of this development code generally, no new sign shall be authorized to be erected on the same property, and no new sign shall be permitted by the city, unless the property on which the new sign is proposed is in
Article 7, Signs and Advertising Devices, Powder Springs, GA, Unified Development Code
253
compliance with the requirements of this article in all respects. At the discretion of the community development director, sign permits may be withheld if the site on which the sign is proposed to be located contains a prohibited sign, a derelict sign, or a sign for which maintenance is required and which has not been maintained in accordance with the requirements of this article. Additionally, the community development director may elect not to issue a sign permit on a site which contains a nonconforming sign, until such nonconforming sign is removed or made to comply with this article.

Article 8, Land Development Requirements, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
256
Division I. General Provisions.
Sec. 8-1. Purpose.
This article includes requirements that apply to the land development process, including provisions for environmental protection, site grading and land disturbance activities, the installation of utilities and improvements; and land development activities.
Sec. 8-2. Definitions.
Definitions in articles 9, 10, 11, and 12 of this development code apply to this article unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. In addition, the following terms are hereby defined:
Buffer, stream: A natural or enhanced vegetated area (established by this division), lying adjacent to the stream.
Fill: A portion of land surface to which soil or other solid material has been added; the depth above the original ground surface or an excavation.
Grading: Altering the shape of ground surfaces to a predetermined condition; this includes stripping, cutting, filling, stockpiling and shaping or any combination thereof and shall include the land in its cut or filled condition.
Impervious cover: Any manmade paved, hardened or structural surface regardless of material. Impervious cover includes but is not limited to rooftops, buildings, streets, roads, decks, swimming pools and any concrete or asphalt.
Land development: Any land change, including but not limited to clearing, grubbing, stripping, removal of vegetation, dredging, grading, excavating, transporting and filling of land, construction, paving and any other installation of impervious cover.
Land disturbing activity: Any activity which may result in soil erosion from water or wind and the movement of sediments into state waters or onto lands within the state, including, but not limited to, clearing, grubbing, stripping, removal of vegetation, dredging, grading, excavating, transporting and filling of land but not including agricultural practices or other activities exempt from the requirements of this article.
Riparian: Belonging or related to the bank of a river, stream, lake, pond or impoundment.
State waters: Any and all rivers, streams, creeks, branches, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainage systems, springs, wells, and other bodies of surface or subsurface water, natural or artificial, lying within or forming a part of the boundaries of Georgia which are not entirely confined and retained completely upon the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation.
Article 8, Land Development Requirements, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
257
Stream: Any perennial or intermittent stream as defined and as shown on a United States Geological Survey quadrangle map; or any state waters as defined.
Stream, ephemeral: A stream that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow.
Stream, intermittent: A stream with a well-defined channel that contains water for only part of the year (typically during winter and spring). The flow may be heavily supplemented by stormwater. When dry, an intermittent stream typically lacks the biological and hydrological characteristics commonly associated with continuous conveyances of water.
Stream, perennial: A stream with a well-defined channel that contains water year round during a year with normal rainfall. Groundwater is the primary source of water, but a perennial stream also carries stormwater. Perennial streams exhibit the typical biological, hydrological, and physical characteristics commonly associated with the continuous conveyance of water.
Stream bank: The confining cut of a stream channel and is usually identified as the point where the normal stream flow has wrested the vegetation. For non-trout waters, the normal stream flow is any stream flow that consists solely of base flow or consists of both base flow and direct runoff during any period of the year. Base flow results from groundwater that enters the stream channel through the soil. This includes spring flows into streams. Direct runoff is the water entering stream channels promptly after rainfalls or snow melts.
Stream channel: The portion of a watercourse that contains the base flow of the stream.
Stream protection area: The combined area of all required buffers and setbacks applicable to such stream.
Watershed: The land area that drains into a particular stream.
Wetlands: Freshwater areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar freshwater areas.
Sec. 8-3. Exemptions.
This article shall not apply to the following activities:
(a) Work consisting of the repair or maintenance of any lawful use of land that is zoned and approved for such use on or before the effective date of this article.
(b) Existing development and ongoing land disturbance activities including but not limited to existing agriculture, silviculture, landscaping, gardening and lawn maintenance, except
Article 8, Land Development Requirements, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
258
that new development or land disturbance activities on such properties will be subject to all applicable requirements of this article.
(c) Any land development activity that is under construction or fully approved for development, as of the effective date of this article.
(d) Land development activity that has not been submitted for approval, but that is part of a larger master development plan, such as for an office park or other phased development, that has been previously approved within two years of the effective date of this article.
Sec. 8-4. Reference to Requirements.
(a) Site design review. Prior to, or concurrent with, submission of an application for development permit, site design review and approval shall be accomplished in accordance with the requirements of article 5, division II.
(b) Subdivision. An application for a development permit approval may be processed independently or in conjunction with an application for preliminary plat approval, but a development permit shall not be issued for lands being subdivided and involving public streets, private streets, or any public improvement as defined, without the prior approval of a preliminary plat. See Sec. 15-22 of this development code.
(c) Tree and buffer protection. Prior to the commencement of grading, development, or land disturbance, areas outside the limits of approved clearing such as natural buffers, stream buffers, and tree protection zones shall be identified by survey stakes, flags, ribbons, or other appropriate markings. The community development director or designee shall inspect and approve all protective fencing prior to commencement of any clearing or grading activity. See Sec. 12-24 of this development code for details relative to tree protection areas.
(d) Grading. Grading shall be performed in accordance with the lines and grades indicated on the approved grading plan, in accordance with the requirements of division IV of this article.
(e) Soil erosion and sedimentation control. All required soil erosion and sedimentation control measures and stormwater drainage facilities shall be installed in accordance with the approved plans consistent with the requirements of article 9 of this development code.
(f) Stormwater management. Stormwater drainage facilities shall be installed in accordance with the approved stormwater management plan as specified in article 11 of this development code.
[Secs. 8-5 to 8-10 Reserved.]
Article 8, Land Development Requirements, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
259
Division II. Wetlands.
Sec. 8-11. Official Map of Protected Wetlands Adopted.
(a) The national wetlands inventory maps prepared by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as they apply to the City of Powder Springs, are hereby adopted and incorporated herein by reference as the official map of protected wetlands in the city.
(b) The map of protected wetlands may be amended by the City Council following the same procedures required for an amendment to the official zoning map.
Sec. 8-12. Jurisdictional Wetlands.
The National Wetlands Inventory maps adopted in this division do not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the City of Powder Springs and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this ordinance does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements.
Sec. 8-13. Alteration of Wetlands.
Alteration or degradation of a jurisdictional wetland requires prior approval by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers under Section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act, as amended.
Sec. 8-14. Identification of Wetlands on Development Plans.
(a) It shall be the responsibility of the design professional preparing development plans, subdivision plats, and building plans to review the map of protected wetlands and to determine whether jurisdictional wetlands exist on the site to be developed, prior to land disturbance or development.
(b) All protected wetlands and jurisdictional wetlands shall be identified and the boundaries thereof indicated on development plans, plats, and building plans where applicable.
Sec. 8-15. Protection of Wetlands.
(a) Jurisdictional wetland. No development permit shall be issued by the City for development or land disturbance within a jurisdictional wetland, until a Section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Development or activities within a jurisdictional wetland shall be limited to those authorized by such permit or letter of permission.
(b) Protected wetland. No development permit shall be issued by the City for development or land disturbance within a protected wetland, unless activities proposed are specifically identified on approved development plans. The community development director may limit activities within a protected wetland to: timber production and harvesting; wildlife
Article 8, Land Development Requirements, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
260
and fisheries management; camping, hiking, hunting and fishing activities, or other authorized recreation; public wastewater treatment and natural water quality treatment or purification facilities; and/or other uses permitted under Section 404 of the federal Clean Water Act. Sanitary landfills and hazardous waste receiving, treatment or disposal facilities are specifically prohibited within protected wetlands.
[Secs. 8-16 to 8-20 Reserved].
Division III. Riparian Buffers and Impervious Surface Setbacks.
Sec. 8-21. Findings.
Buffers adjacent to riparian areas provide numerous benefits including: protecting, restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical and biological integrity of streams and water resources; removing pollutants delivered in urban stormwater; reducing erosion and controlling sedimentation; protecting and stabilizing stream banks and riparian areas; providing for infiltration of stormwater runoff; maintaining base flow of streams; contributing organic matter that is a source of food and energy for the aquatic ecosystem; providing tree canopy to shade streams and riparian areas and promote desirable aquatic habitat; providing riparian wildlife habitat; furnishing scenic value and recreational opportunity; and providing opportunities for the protection and restoration of greenspace.
Sec. 8-22. Exemptions and Exceptions.
The following activities are exempt from the requirements of this division:
(a) Activities for the purpose of building one of the following: a stream crossing by a driveway, transportation route or utility line; public water supply intake or public wastewater outfall structures; intrusions necessary to provide access to a property; public access facilities that must be on the water including boat ramps, docks, foot trails leading directly to the river, fishing platforms and overlooks; and unpaved foot trails and paths; activities to restore and enhance stream bank stability, vegetation, water quality and/or aquatic habitat, so long as native vegetation and bioengineering techniques are used.
(b) Public sewer line easements paralleling the stream, except that all easements (permanent and construction) and land disturbance should be at least 25 feet from the top of the bank. This includes such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including but not limited to manholes, vents and valve structures. This exemption shall not be construed as allowing the construction of roads, bike paths or other transportation routes in such easements, regardless of paving material, except for access for the uses specifically cited in this section.
(c) Land development activities within a right-of-way on the effective date of this article.
(d) Within an easement of any utility existing at the time this ordinance takes effect or approved under the terms of this article, land disturbance activities and such impervious
Article 8, Land Development Requirements, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
261
cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including but not limited to manholes, vents, and valve structures.
(e) Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property. However, when emergency work is performed under this section, the person performing it shall report such work to the community development director on the next business day after commencement of the work. The community development director after inspection of the emergency work may require the person performing emergency work to correct any impairment such emergency work may have caused to the water conveyance capacity, stability or water quality of the protection area.
(f) Forestry and silviculture activities on land that is zoned for forestry, silvicultural or agricultural uses and are not incidental to other land development activity. If such activity results in land disturbance in the buffer that would otherwise be prohibited, then no other land disturbing activity other than normal forest management practices will be allowed on the entire property for three years after the end of the activities that intruded on the buffer.
(g) Work authorized by or conducted pursuant to the requirements or directives of local, state, and federal departments, agencies and authorities.
The following activities are exceptions from the requirements of this division:
(a) Where the 100-year floodplain constricts within the buffer and buffer averaging is permitted such that the net buffer area is not reduced or the average buffer width conforms to the widths as outlined above (this exception is not applicable to the state-mandated 25 foot buffer).
(b) Where the Community Development Director, or his/her assign(s) determine to allow a variance to the requirements greater than the state-mandated 25-foot buffer that is at least protective of natural resources and the environment, or where otherwise allowed pursuant to O.C.G.A.§12-2-8. For the purposes of this section, at least as protective shall mean that there is no net decrease in the square footage of the required buffer that is greater than the state-mandated 25-foot buffer. Any request to allow a variance that would result in a net decrease in the square footage of the required buffer that is greater than the state-mandated 25-foot buffer must be approved by the City of Powder Springs in accordance with Section 8-24 and Article 14 of the Unified Development Code.
Sec. 8-23. Buffers and Impervious Setbacks.
All land development activity subject to this division shall meet the following requirements:
(a) Buffer. An undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained for 50 feet, measured horizontally, on both banks (as applicable) of all streams, as measured from the top of the stream bank.
Article 8, Land Development Requirements, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
262
(b) Impervious surface setback. An additional setback shall be maintained for 25 feet, measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed natural vegetative buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited. Grading, filling, and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback.
(c) Septic tanks and drain fields. No septic tanks or septic tank drain fields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback required by this section.
All buffer and setback areas required by this section shall be shown on all final plats and development and building plans pertaining to the property.
Sec. 8-24. Variances.
Upon application in accordance with article 14 of this development code, the governing body may vary the requirement of this section to maintain that portion of the requirement 50-foot buffer furthest from the stream bank, and the requirement to set back for impervious surfaces. Variances shall not be allowed by the city to that portion of the require stream buffer within 25 feet of the stream bank.
The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance:
(a) The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property;
(b) The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries;
(c) The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion;
(d) Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion;
(e) The long-term and construction water-quality impacts of the proposed variance;
(f) Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment; and
(g) Whether the actions of the property owner have created conditions of a hardship on that property, in which case a variance should not be granted.
Sec. 8-25. Relationship to Other Regulations.
This division is not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute or other provision of law. The requirements of this division are considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this development code imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule, regulation or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence.
Article 8, Land Development Requirements, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
263
Sec. 8-26. Minimum Requirements.
This division shall not be construed as preventing the establishment of wider and/or more restrictive buffers and setbacks as required under any other existing or future legislation. In addition, nothing in this division shall be construed as preventing the establishment of wider buffers for purposes of protecting greenspace, preserving habitat, or other goals that may not be specifically mandated by legislation.
[Secs. 8-27 to 8-30 Reserved].
Division IV. Land Clearance and Grading.
Sec. 8-31. No Clearing Prior to Development Plan Approval.
Grubbing, clearing, land disturbance, or development of property shall not take place until a development permit if required by this article has been approved and issued by the community development department; provided however, that the community development director may issue a clearing and grubbing permit only if activities are limited to the removal of vegetation and stumps and the placement of required tree protection measures and soil erosion and sedimentation control devices.
Sec. 8-32. Clearing Limits.
(a) Clearing and land disturbing activities are subject to the limits of Sec. 12-13 of this development code. The community development director shall not authorize a development plan that proposes the clearing of more than 8 acres of land without the specific authorization of the Mayor and City Council. Clearing for other than installation of infrastructure, right-of-way, or parking areas (for commercial, industrial or institutional developments) on a subsequent phase may not begin until 50% of the structures in the previous phase have been issued building permits and 25% of the structures in the previous phase have been issued certificates of occupancy.
(b) No clearing or land disturbing activity shall occur beyond the limits of clearing shown on approved development plans.
Sec. 8-33. Maximum Slopes.
Article 8, Land Development Requirements, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
264
(a) The maximum slope for all cut or fill slopes shall be 2:1 (2 feet of run for every 1foot of rise); provided, however, that when a cut is made in rock that requires blasting, the public works director may be authorize a slope to exceed the maximum of 2:1.
(b) The slope on cut or fill shall be uniform throughout for each section of cut or fill.
(c) Guard rails shall be required at the top of cut or fill for any depth of cut or fill exceeding 5 feet.
Sec. 8-34. Borrow and Fill.
Authorization must be obtained from the community development department to conduct soil and material borrowing and filling operations from one property to another. If the proposed grading requires removal of or filling in of 100 cubic yards or less, no permit shall be required. If more than 100 cubic yards are involved, a permit shall be required to be issued by the community development department.
Sec. 8-35. Additional Grading Requirements.
(a) Stumps and Debris. Before grading is started, the area shall be first cleared of all stumps, roots, and brush. Debris that is removed shall be disposed of in a lawful manner. No debris of any kind shall be buried at the site of any construction or development. If any sections of the subgrade are composed of unsuitable or unstable material, such material shall be removed to the depth directed by the public works director and replaced with suitable, thoroughly compacted material.
(b) Stockpile of topsoil. In all areas to be graded or filled, the developer shall stockpile the topsoil to be spread later in disturbed areas not paved.
(c) Street right of ways. When streets are proposed, all street right of ways shall be graded to their full width by the developer so that pavement extensions or sidewalks, where required or if installed in the future, can be constructed on the same level plane.
(d) Cover of disturbed areas. Immediately after grading and re-spreading of topsoil, all areas of disturbed soil shall be fertilized and seeded to achieve a suitable vegetative cover to prevent soil erosion. Areas of steep slopes shall be sodded or otherwise appropriately re-vegetated. When all construction is completed, all slopes and street shoulders shall be cleared of all rubbish and a suitable vegetative cover shall be established by sprigging, seeding, or sodding to prevent undue erosion. See also article 9 of this development code for specific soil erosion and sedimentation control requirements.

265
Division V. Development Plans and Development Permit.
Sec. 8-41. Approval Required.
It shall be unlawful for any person to commence or proceed with land-disturbing activity until development plans are approved and a development permit is issued by the community development department.
Sec. 8-42. Pre-Application.

Article 8, Land Development Requirements, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
282
Sec. 8-97. Public Water.
(a) Public water service shall be provided to every lot in a subdivision and to every development for both domestic use and fire protection if public water is available or programmed to be available within 1,000 feet of the subdivision or development (or 100 feet of an individual single-family residential lot not in a subdivision). Water mains shall be connected to the existing public water system and extended past each lot.
(b) Developers are required to extend all mains along their entire property frontage if the existing main is not adjacent to the proposed development. The size of the extension will be at least the size of the existing main and may be larger according to the City. The oversizing may be eligible for reimbursement under agreement. If eligible, the difference in cost for lines larger than those required to serve the development will be paid by the City. If an existing main must be extended to serve a particular development, the developer will be required to pay all the initial costs. If the main extension would serve other developments within a three year period the City may negotiate with the initial developer for pro rata share reimbursement from future developers who wish to tie on during the three year period. This three year period would begin upon completion of the extension and acceptance by the City for perpetual maintenance.
(c) Any single-family or multifamily dwelling, commercial or industrial establishment shall be connected to a public water supply approved by the City. Connection shall be at the cost of the property owner.
(d) Fire hydrants shall be required to be installed along the streets in every subdivision and within every development project. Hydrants shall be located in accordance with article 21 of this development code.
(e) A contractor approved by the City shall install all elements of the water system, including mains, valves and hydrants at the developers expense.
(f) The City may participate in sharing the costs of construction and installation to the extent that pipe sizes are needed in excess of that size required to exclusively serve the subdivision or development.
(g) If a permit from the Georgia Department of Natural Resources is required for construction of a water system, all Department requirements for design and material and construction specifications must be met to secure a permit.
Sec. 8-98. Sanitary Sewer.
(a) Every lot in a subdivision and every development shall be connected to a public sanitary sewerage system unless on-site disposal is allowed by this Code and the Cobb County Health Department.
Article 8, Land Development Requirements, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
283
(b) Any single-family or multifamily dwelling, institutional, commercial or industrial establishment shall be connected to public sewer when sewerage lines are available for connection. Connection shall be at the cost of the property owner.
(c) Sewerage shall be considered available to an existing single-family dwelling or other connection when the dwelling or building can be connected by gravity flow to a line in any public right-of-way or easement that passes the property at any point.
(d) Sewerage shall be considered available to any new single-family dwelling when the dwelling can be connected by the installation of 300 linear feet of gravity flow line from the nearest point of the property.
(e) Sewerage shall be considered available to any new subdivision when trunk sewers have been extended into the drainage basin.
(f) Sewerage shall also be considered available when trunk sewers are constructed under a current funding program. Trunk sewers are those sewers recognized in the Facilities Plan, or other planning documents of the City. When trunk sewers are to be funded under future bond programs, sewerage will not be considered available.
(g) To determine the availability of sewerage to any multi- family dwelling, commercial or industrial tract the sewage effluent for the development will be converted to its equivalent number of single-family dwellings. For comparison purposes, a single-family dwelling generates an effluent of 400 gallons per day of sewage.
(h) Sewer lines shall be connected to an existing sanitary sewerage system and extended past each lot.
(i) Every component of the sanitary sewer system, including mains, lift stations, outfalls, and laterals, shall be installed at the developers expense by a contractor approved by the jurisdiction that owns the sanitary sewerage system.
Sec. 8-99. Dry Sewerage Available.
(a) In cases where the City is to expend bond funds within a drainage basin in two years but said sewers are not available at present, the developer will be required to install dry lines to serve any structure to be built in the development. These lines will collect at a single point at the property line at the lowest point on the property or at a point designated by the Engineer.
(b) The installation of dry lines does not in any way relieve the requirements of the Cobb County Health Department for approving septic tanks in the development.
(c) No dry sewers shall be used until such time as trunk sewers are constructed to an acceptable treatment facility. No pumping and hauling of sewage is allowed. Septic tanks
Article 8, Land Development Requirements, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
284
placed on the lots shall be located at a point to facilitate future connection of the home to the tap provided.
Sec. 8-100. Sewerage Not Available.
(a) If sewerage is not available nor shall be available, a 20 foot permanent and 60 foot construction sanitary sewer easement shall be shown on the plans and dedicated to the City of Powder Springs for future use, in those areas where a proposed subdivision is adjacent to a creek or branch whose drainage area is 200 acres or greater. The City of Powder Springs may at its option require additional easements.
(b) Minimum easement widths to be dedicated are 20 foot for permanent easements and 60 foot for construction easements, with the construction easement centered on the permanent easement. Also, in the event that a trunk or interceptor greater than 15 inches is expected to pass through the development, the construction easement width shall be increased to the amount required for construction of the expected sewer. All easements are to be checked in the field and must be adequate for the purpose they are dedicated. Also, consideration must be given for expected building locations and the easement shall be located for the least possibility of conflict before the sewer may be constructed. No structures shall be built on dedicated easements, and the City will not be responsible for the removal of fences that are placed on dedicated easements in the event the sewer is constructed. Septic tanks in these type developments shall be placed in a location to facilitate tie-on of structure to the sewer.
Sec. 8-101. Sewer Types.
(a) Building sewers. Building sewers are used to convey wastewater from the buildings to lateral sewers, or any other sewer except another building sewer. These sewers are privately funded. Typically, these lines extend from the building to the property line where they tie into a lateral system.
(b) Lateral sewers. Lateral sewers form the first element of the public wastewater collection system and are usually in streets, rights-of-way, or special easements. They are used to collect wastewater from building sewers and convey it to a main sewer. The minimum lateral sewer size is 6 inches. In new subdivisions these sewers are privately funded.
(c) Main sewers. Main sewers are used to convey wastewater from one or more lateral sewers to trunk sewers or to intercepting sewers. These sewers are a minimum of 8 inches in diameter and can extend beyond the property boundaries of subdivisions.
(d) Trunk sewers. Trunk sewers are large sewers that are used to convey wastewater from main sewers to treatment or other disposal facilities or to large intercepting sewers.
(e) Intercepting sewers. Intercepting sewers are large sewers that are used to intercept a number of main or trunk sewers and convey the wastewater to treatment or other disposal facilities.
Article 8, Land Development Requirements, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
285
Sec. 8-102. Developer Agreements for Sewerage.
(a) The City of Powder Springs recognizes that major sewer extensions are costly but must be made by private developers to make some developments workable. It is the intent of the City of Powder Springs to indirectly assist in these major extensions of sewer lines by adopting the policy described in this section.
(b) A major sewer extension shall be defined as a sewer line extension by a private developer that costs in excess of $100,000.00 and is not located within a new residential subdivision.
(c) The private developer will be eligible to recover, over a maximum of three years from the date the sewer line is accepted by the City, up to 75% of the cost of the sewer extension. This recovery shall be as follows: The City will collect the tap fees for all services that connect into the collection lines paid for by the developer as provided for in above. For a period for three years, the City will keep 25% of these fees and will remit 75% of the fees collected to the private developer up to a maximum of 75% of his total recoverable cost. After a period of three years or after a developer has recovered 75% of the allowable cost, the City shall retain 100% of the sewer tap fees.

Division II. Minimum Requirements/Best Management Practices.
Sec. 9-11. General Requirements.
(a) Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES General Permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans.
(b) Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of Section 9-11 of this ordinance. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this ordinance and the NPDES General Permit.
(c) Best management practices as set forth in Section 9-11 of this ordinance shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with this article or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-30, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. As used in this article, the terms "proper design and properly designed mean designed in accordance

294
with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 subsection (b).
(d) A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than 5 acres.
(e) Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the Division pursuant to subsection (f) of Code Section 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs.
(f) The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the Board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur.
Sec. 9-12. Adherence to Erosion Control Manual and Additional Requirements.
The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A.12-7-1 et. seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following:
(a) Stripping of vegetation, re-grading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion;
(b) Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum;
(c) Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential;
(d) Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented;
Article 9, Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
295
(e) The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum;
(f) Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable;
(g) Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development;
(h) Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable;
(i) To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et. seq.;
(j) Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills;
(k) Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property;

Article 10, Floodplain Management, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
305
Division I. General Provisions.
Sec. 10-1. Findings.
(a) The flood hazard areas in the City of Powder Springs, Georgia, are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(b) These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities.
(c) Effective floodplain management and flood hazard protection measures can: protect human life and health; minimize damage to private property; minimize damage to public facilities and infrastructure such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; and minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the public.
(d) Flood hazard areas can also serve important stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation and ecological purposes when permanently protected as undisturbed or minimally disturbed areas.
(e) The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur; flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create any liability on the part of the City of Powder Springs or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
Sec. 10-2. Purposes.
The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in flood hazard areas, and to protect the beneficial uses of floodplain areas for water quality protection, streambank and stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation, and ecological and environmental protection by provisions designed to accomplish the following objectives:
(a) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
Article 10, Floodplain Management, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
306
(b) Restrict or prohibit uses that are threats to public health and safety as well as property due to flooding or erosion hazards, or that increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion;
(c) Control filling, grading, dredging and other development activities that may increase flood damage or erosion;
(d) Prevent or regulate construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or that may increase flood hazard to other lands;
(e) Limit or prohibit altogether the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers that are involved in accommodation of flood waters; and
(f) Protect the stormwater management, water quality, streambank protection, stream corridor protection, wetlands preservation and ecological functions of natural floodplain areas.

Division I. General Provisions.
Sec. 11-1. Findings.
(a) Land development projects and other land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition.
(b) Land development projects and other land use conversions also contribute to increased nonpoint source pollution and degradation of receiving waters.
(c) The impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quantity and quality can adversely affect public safety, public and private property, drinking water supplies, recreation, fish and other aquatic life, property values and other uses of lands and waters.
(d) These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from land development by the use of structural facilities as well as nonstructural measures, such as the conservation of greenspace.
(e) Preservation and protection of natural areas for stormwater management benefits is encouraged through the use of incentives or credits.
(f) The Georgia Greenspace Program provides a mechanism for preservation and coordination of those greenspace areas that yield stormwater management quality and quantity benefits.
(g) Compliance by municipalities in the state of Georgia with a number of both State and Federal laws, regulations and permits is mandated to address the impacts of post-development stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution.
(h) It is reasonable to establish this set of stormwater management requirements to regulate post-development stormwater runoff for protecting local water resources from degradation. The regulation of post-development stormwater runoff discharges in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion and nonpoint source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff is in the public interest.
(i) Stormwater pond technology is limited in its ability to protect watersheds and cannot reproduce predevelopment hydrological functions. Through the use of stormwater better site design practices, the need for stormwater ponds on individual development sites can sometimes be eliminated, or at least the pond size can be decreased.
Sec. 11-2. Purpose and Objectives.
The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to
Article 11, Stormwater Management, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
327
control the adverse effects of post-development stormwater runoff and nonpoint source pollution associated with development. Proper management of post-development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to achieve that purpose through the pursuing of the following objectives:
(a) Implement decision-making processes and procedures concerning land development that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources;
(b) Require that development projects maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-development state as closely as is feasible to reduce flooding, stream bank erosion, nonpoint source pollution and increases in stream water temperature while maintaining the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats;
(c) Establish minimum post-development stormwater management standards and design criteria for regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality;
(d) Formulate design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities used to achieve minimum post-development stormwater management standards;
(e) Strongly encourage the implementation of principles of low-impact development, including the use of nonstructural stormwater management and improved stormwater better site design practices such as preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas to the maximum practical extent, as are more fully described in Section 4.3 of Volume 1 of the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual and Section 4.1 of Volume 2 of said Manual
(f) Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure such facilities continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and,
(g) Adopt administrative procedures for submission and review of stormwater management plans, for the monitoring and inspection of projects under construction, and for long-term follow up inspection of completed projects.

Appendix 12-A Powder Springs Tree Species List
Division I. Purpose and General Provisions.
Sec. 12-1. Findings.
(a) Trees are a valuable community resource that the City desires to conserve and increase. Trees provide food and shelter for wildlife, reduce noise and glare, provide wind breaks, purify the air, control erosion, reduce stormwater runoff, moderate temperatures, increase property value, improve water quality, increase the aesthetic qualities of the environment, and positively influence human behavior.
(b) This Article also establishes standards for buffers and site landscaping. Buffers can be comprised of landscaping, fencing, walls and earth berms and serve to minimize harmful impacts on surrounding uses such as noise, dust, and glare generated by more intense land uses. Buffers can also reduce visual impacts generated by more intense land uses, establish a sense of privacy and protect the public health, safety and welfare of the community.
Sec. 12-2. Purposes.
(a) Goals. It is the goal of the City of Powder Springs to conserve and maintain as much of its existing tree canopy coverage as possible. The purpose of this article is to provide regulations for tree canopy retention and enhancement, protection of individual trees, landscaping, and buffers that promote the quality of the community through sound developmental processes that protect and enhance community resources. The city also
Article 12, Tree Protection, Buffers, and Landscaping, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
355
intends to provide flexibility in certain regulations so that the overarching objective of tree canopy can be attained.
(b) Ancillary objectives. The city hereby recognizes that trees and vegetation may serve other purposes not explicit in this article, including but not limited to: the provision of adequate sunlight for the operation of solar energy, which may conflict with the tree canopy requirements of this article; the use of landscaping techniques to address sun angles and block prevailing winds; and the selection of landscaping types that produce fruits and nuts for consumption. Landscaping and tree provision is hereby recognized as an opportunity for human food production, not merely for their aesthetic and climatic benefits.

[Sec. 12-10. Reserved].
Division II. Tree Canopy Coverage.
Sec 12-11. Determination of Existing Tree Canopy Coverage.
(a) Generally. Unless otherwise exempt from the requirements of this article, prior to engaging in land subdivision, land disturbance, or land development, it shall be the duty of land developers and subdividers to calculate existing tree canopy coverage on any site to be subdivided, disturbed or developed.
(b) Sites of two acres or more. When the site to be subdivided, disturbed, or developed consists of two acres or more, the subdivider or land developer shall submit a tree canopy coverage survey prepared by a qualified professional, showing the location of existing tree canopy coverage on the development site or lot. The survey shall include a calculation of existing tree canopy coverage, i.e., percent of total site area comprised of tree canopy coverage. Tree canopy coverage provided by the existing tree canopy will be determined by actual measurement of the square footage of the canopy of qualifying trees or contiguous stand of qualifying trees, except that sampling methods may substitute for actual measurements of tree canopy coverage for sites of 10 acres or more.
(c) Sites less than two acres. For sites less than two acres, the extent of tree canopy coverage can be estimated based on a current or reasonably current (i.e., not more than three years from the date an application for subdivision, land disturbance, or land development is submitted) aerial photograph of the site. In cases where an aerial photograph is used to determine tree canopy cover of a given site, a copy of the aerial photograph shall be provided as part of application for subdivision, land disturbance, or land development. Estimates of tree canopy coverage should be verified in the field by the applicant (with notation of date of field verification so noted in the application) and are subject to verification in the field by the city.
Sec 12-12. Existing Tree Canopy Coverage Retention Required.
(a) Existing tree canopy on the parcel of land to be subdivided, disturbed or developed should be retained to the maximum extent possible. Land developers and subdividers will be required to consider designing land development in a way that protects existing trees
Article 12, Tree Protection, Buffers, and Landscaping, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
365
to the maximum extent possible, while allowing for reasonable development of the site as more fully described in this section.
(b) In general, healthy, native trees that are 20 or more inches diameter breast height and significant stands of trees are the highest priority for preservation and conversely trees that exhibit poor form, individual pines or trees that do not appear on the Powder Springs Tree Species List are not considered a priority for preservation. However, specific characteristics of the trees, site and surrounding area should be considered and may call for different priorities, such as native tree growth rates and trees identified in the Powder Springs Tree Species List, buffering natural resources, preventing erosion or slope destabilization, and limiting impacts on adjacent sites.
(c) Where no tree canopy exists on the site to be subdivided, disturbed, or developed, the applicant shall indicate such in the application for subdivision, land disturbance, or land development.
Sec. 12-13. Removal of Existing Tree Canopy and Clearing Limits.
(a) Findings. Retention of existing tree coverage is in the public interest and also in the interest of the subdivider or land developer because retention of existing trees and tree canopies is the most cost effective way to meet the tree canopy coverage requirements of this division.
(b) Stream buffers. Existing trees shall not be removed from any stream buffer required by state law or required by the soil erosion and sedimentation control regulations of this development code, unless specifically authorized via variance by the Mayor and City Council, and the first 25 foot of stream buffer closest to the stream bed shall not be disturbed unless specifically authorized via variance by the Director of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources Environmental Protection Division.
(c) Tree save areas. Existing trees within a tree save area designated on a recorded subdivision plat or approved land development plan shall not be removed except as otherwise specifically authorized via variance by the Mayor and City Council. Existing tree canopy within such a tree save area shall be maintained unless specifically authorized by the city for reduction in accordance with this article.
(d) Zoning buffers. Existing trees within natural vegetative buffer required by this development code shall not be removed except as otherwise specifically authorized by the buffer provisions of this Development Code or unless a variance is granted by the Mayor and City Council in accordance with this development code.
(e) Clearcutting limits. The community development director shall not authorize a development plan that proposes the clearing of more than 8 acres of land (other than clearing for infrastructure) without the specific authorization of the Mayor and City Council.
Article 12, Tree Protection, Buffers, and Landscaping, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
366
(f) Phasing of clearing. Clearing for other than installation of infrastructure, right-of-way, or parking areas (for commercial, industrial or institutional developments) on a subsequent phase may not begin until 50 percent of the structures in the previous phase have been issued building permits and 25 percent of the structures in the previous phase have been issued certificates of occupancy.
(g) Retention of existing canopy. Where a development site or lot has existing tree canopy, no more than 75 percent of the existing tree canopy coverage of the site or lot shall be removed.
(h) Existing pine tree canopy. Where existing pines already comprise 50 percent or more of the required minimum tree canopy coverage, no more pine trees if planted shall be credited toward meeting the minimum required tree canopy coverage.
Sec. 12-14. Minimum Tree Canopy Coverage Requirements by Land Use.
(a) Minimum ratios. All subdivisions and land developments shall meet the minimum tree canopy coverage requirements for the land use as indicated in Table 12-1.
Table 12-1
Minimum Tree Canopy Coverage Requirements by Land Use
Land Use
Minimum Tree Canopy Coverage Required (% of development site or lot)

(b) Determination, uncertainty, and interpretation. With respect to classifying a land use for purposes of this section, the director of community development shall determine the land use as that use is the principal use of the development site or lot. The director shall be authorized to interpret the land use classifications in Table 12-1 in cases of uncertainty.
(c) Timing of compliance. Compliance with the requirements of this section will be determined at the time of development plan review (including review of tree save areas and a landscaping plan proposing tree canopy) for a land development and at the time of preliminary subdivision plat review for a subdivision if required or final plat approval if no preliminary plat is required.
Article 12, Tree Protection, Buffers, and Landscaping, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
367

Article 12, Tree Protection, Buffers, and Landscaping, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
368
(d) Canopy cover credit for individual trees. For the purposes of this article, the tree canopy cover that is credited to an individual tree shall be either the actual square foot area of the crown's projection directly down onto the ground, or the tree canopy coverage at maturity as specified for the species as listed in the Powder Springs Tree Species List, whichever is greater. Any tree of a species not on the Powder Springs Tree Species List shall be given the tree canopy cover at maturity for the size typical of the species using standard landscaping references.
(e) Tree canopy credit for specimen trees. On development sites or lots, existing specimen trees retained and protected per this article shall be given twice the future tree canopy listed in the Powder Springs Tree Species List or twice the actual tree canopy, whichever is greater. In such cases, the area of tree canopy for which credit is given shall always remain in tree canopy, and there shall be no other use of the area other than for tree growth. The area shall remain permeable and undeveloped.
(f) Compliance at maturity. For purposes of this Section, a development site or subdivision shall be determined to be in compliance with the requirements of this section at the time any trees on the site are planted at the time of occupancy, even though the trees planted may not have reached maturity such that they provide the tree canopy area for that tree as designated in the Powder Springs Tree Species List. That is to say, compliance will be determined per all existing tree canopy coverage plus that mature tree canopy coverage that will ultimately result from the tree plantings, for the tree or trees as indicated in the Powder Springs Tree Species List.
(g) Existing canopy. Development sites and subdivisions which have existing trees which result in a tree canopy coverage that meets or exceeds the requirements of Table 12-1 will not be required to plant additional trees, except as may be required to meet parking lot landscaping, landscape strip, and/or buffer requirements of this Development Code. For purposes of this section, the tree canopy credited to an individual tree shall be either the actual area of the canopy of the tree projected onto the ground, or the tree canopy at maturity for the species as listed in the Powder Springs Tree Species List, whichever is greater.
(h) Platted and developed single-family residential lots. Any lot that is recorded and which contains a detached, single-family residence as the principal use of the lot shall meet the 20% minimum tree canopy coverage requirement of this section, if canopy existed at time of adoption of this article. In cases where the minimum tree canopy did not exist, the existing tree canopy on a lot shall be maintained. The City may issue additional development permissions such as a building permit to enlarge the dwelling or the addition of an accessory structure, on the lot even though it does not comply with this 20% minimum tree canopy coverage requirement of this section. However, such lots are not exempt from protecting trees within any tree protection area designated on an approved development plan or a recorded plat for the lot. Individual lots within said subdivision shall not be required to attain the 20% requirement for residential, single-family as specified in Table 12-1.
Article 12, Tree Protection, Buffers, and Landscaping, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
369
(i) Single-family residential subdivisions and individual lots within. A subdivision designed for detached, single-family dwellings shall comply with this section at the time of preliminary plat approval, if required, or final plat approval if no preliminary plat is required. This means that the total site area included within the subdivision shall be required to meet the requirements of this section and that individual lots within a subdivision shall not be subject to the requirements of this section.
(j) Maintenance. The required tree canopy, saved and planted, shall be maintained in perpetuity. Property owners shall have a continuing obligation to maintain the tree canopy percentage coverage required by this division.
(k) Exemption for lakes and ponds. The area within natural or manmade bodies of water of two or more acres may be subtracted from calculations of tree canopy required.
Sec. 12-15. Addition of Trees to Meet Minimum Tree Canopy Coverage Requirements.
(a) When required. When a development site or subdivision does not meet the minimum tree canopy coverage required by this Section 12-14 via the maintenance of existing trees on site at the time of development or subdivision, respectively, the developer or subdivider shall be required to plant trees on the development site or in the subdivisions boundaries sufficient to meet the requirements of Section 12-14. In cases where the maintenance of trees required by Section 12-14 is calculated for the subdivision as a whole, individual lots shall be planted to meet the minimum tree canopy requirement.
(b) Locations. Trees may be planted throughout the development site or lot, although preference should be given to parking lots, and the front yard of the property.
(c) Species selection standards. Species shall be selected that are tolerant of growing conditions on the site, including growing space, sunlight, soil moisture, temperature and soil volume. No more than 30 percent of all trees planted on a lot shall be of any one species.
(d) Pine tree limitation. Where trees must be added to achieve the required tree canopy coverage requirement for the development site or lot, pine trees shall not comprise more than 50 percent of the tree canopy planted.
Sec. 12-16. Tree Bank.
(a) Tree bank established. An alternative means of compliance may be available in certain instances, called the Powder Springs Tree Bank, which is hereby established.
(b) Purchase of canopy credits. If the city determines that tree canopy coverage requirements of this division cannot be met on a particular site, due to lack of existing tree canopy coverage, a lack of suitable places on the development site, or within the subdivision to plant trees for canopy, or other condition that renders it impractical to fully comply with this division, owners of property confirmed by the city as being unable to
Article 12, Tree Protection, Buffers, and Landscaping, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
370
achieve the tree canopy coverage requirements of this division on a particular site may at their option purchase canopy credits from the Powder Springs Tree Bank to compensate for tree canopy deficits.
(c) Calculation of the cost of canopy credits. Canopy deficit is calculated by subtracting the area of tree canopy achieved on site by saved and planted trees from the required tree canopy coverage, rounded up to the nearest 250 square foot increment. Each 250-square foot increment shall equal one canopy credit. Canopy credits may be purchased from the Powder Springs Tree Bank at a cost of $375.00 per credit. This cost assignment is based on average wholesale cost for trees of various sizes that would provide comparable canopy, plus shipping, labor, installation, and a two-year maintenance program.
(d) Use of funds. Funds maintained in the Powder Springs Tree Bank shall be administered by the department of community development with consultation by the Tree Commission and shall be used exclusively for increasing, managing and maintaining tree canopy and tree safety on public property. The Tree Commission shall establish an annual program for administration of these funds.
Sec. 12-17. Alternative Locations.
(a) If the city determines that tree canopy coverage requirements of this division cannot be met on a particular site, due to lack of existing tree canopy coverage, a lack of suitable places on the development site, or within the subdivision to plant trees for canopy, or other condition that renders it impractical to fully comply with this division, owners of property confirmed by the city as being unable to achieve the tree canopy coverage requirements of this division on a particular site may be authorized to plant trees at an alternative location as determined by the community development director with consultation from the Tree Commission.
(b) The first priority for such alternative tree planting location shall be the right-of-way in front of the property in question, if space for street tree planting is available. If such space is not available, the community development director with consultation from the Tree Commission may establish planting priorities for public street rights-of-ways or other public lands, or within easements on private properties abutting street rights-of-ways which do not already have street trees alongside them.
(c) The public works director must authorize all street tree plantings as not in conflict with street, sidewalk, utility, and line-of-sight functions.
Sec. 12-18. Tree Species List.
The Powder Springs Tree Species List is hereby adopted and attached as an appendix to this article.
Article 12, Tree Protection, Buffers, and Landscaping, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
371
Sec. 12-19. Planted Tree Standards.

(b) Caliper and height. Trees shall be a minimum of two inches in caliper for deciduous trees, a minimum of eight feet in height for evergreen trees, and a minimum of one-inch caliper per trunk for multi-stemmed trees at the time of planting.
(c) Critical root zone protection. Grading, excavating, or locating utilities within the critical root zones of trees shall be prohibited. No activity or materials, including solvents, construction equipment, portable toilets, construction trailers or temporary soil deposits shall encroach or be placed within the critical root zone of any tree protected under the requirements of this article.
(d) Soil depth. The soil within an area intended for tree planting shall be well aerated to a minimum depth of eight inches; soils in tree planting islands surrounded by pavement shall be well aerated to a minimum depth of 18 inches.
(e) Soil composition. The soil shall contain a minimum of five percent organic matter. Soil pH shall be within a range of 5.8 to 7.0.
(f) Watering. Trees shall be watered in at the time of planting to eliminate air pockets.
(g) Staking. Tree staking is not required, but if installed, shall be removed by the tree owner no later than six months after planting.
(h) Mulching. Trees shall be mulched immediately in accordance with the mulching ANSI 300 standards as may be revised from time to time.
(i) Additional technical standards. The city with consultation by the Tree Commission may establish additional technical specifications or standard drawings for planting trees which if adopted by the Mayor and City Council will be enforced by the city.

This specifically includes prohibition of the following: vehicle or equipment traffic or storage; materials or supplies storage; placement of temporary or permanent structures; equipment maintenance or washout; wounding of tree trunks; wounding or breakage of limbs or branches greater than four inches in diameter; topping or other improper pruning, such as stub cuts or flush cuts; fires or excessive heat from equipment exhausts; site or lot clearing or grubbing; soil excavation or soil cuts or fills; grading; trenching; tilling; soil compaction; top dressing with fill or soil greater than two inches in depth; and paving.
Sec. 12-25. Tree Damage.
Any tree designated on tree protection and planting plan to be used to comply with the required tree canopy and therefore, to be saved, that is damaged during construction or as a result of construction as determined by the city such that removal is required shall be treated according to ANSI 300 standards or replaced with a tree or trees equal to the tree canopy area and of a similar species. Any specimen tree damaged shall be replaced with trees equal to twice the canopy area at maturity of the tree so damaged.
Sec. 12-26. Tree Replacement.
(a) The property owner or his or her assigns shall replace any protected tree that dies or is removed from a site if such removal results in a tree canopy coverage less than that required by this article, or any other deficiency with regard to meeting the requirements of this article. Replacement is required by the next planting season with a tree of the same or similar species and projected canopy size at maturity.
(b) Replacement of specimen trees shall be at the rate of twice the actual tree canopy of the specimen tree or twice the tree canopy at maturity, whichever is greater.
Sec. 12-27. Tree Removal.
A permit is not required for the removal of trees, however property owners are encouraged to receive determinations per section (e) below prior to tree removal. This section provides clarification and additional provisions with respect to tree removal.
Article 12, Tree Protection, Buffers, and Landscaping, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
375
(a) Exemptions. Tree removal is authorized when such tree removal is consistent with Sec. 12-5, Exemptions. That section includes the removal of dead or hazard trees and specifies other exemptions.
(b) Protected trees. Subject to exemptions specifically authorized, no authorization shall be given by the city to remove trees in any of the following circumstances, except by approval of a variance, variances may be approved administratively if accompanied by a report by a certified arborist: (1) when located within any tree protection area recorded on a final subdivision plat or established on approved land development plans; (2) any tree within any stream buffer established or required by the citys soil erosion control ordinance and this Development Code (which if involving disturbance of the first 25 feet of stream buffer closest to the stream bed, must also obtain variance approval from the Georgia Department of Natural Resources); (3) any tree within a buffer between incompatible uses as required by or as established pursuant to this article; (4) specimen tree and (5) any tree saved or planted to meet the requirements of this article, as indicated on approved tree protection or landscaping plans on file with the city.
(c) Replacement. It shall be the responsibility of each lot owner to maintain compliance with the tree canopy requirements of this Article. If the removal of trees, including dead or hazard trees, would cause the lot to no longer comply with the minimum tree canopy coverage requirements of this Article, then the lot owner shall be obligated to replace the removed trees as required by Sec. 12-26 of this division.
(d) Tree removal on lots containing a single-family dwelling. On lots containing an existing detached, single-family dwelling, trees may be removed only in accordance with the provisions of this section. Existing single-family lots on which a single-family detached dwelling exists shall not be required to file tree protection and tree conservation plans as otherwise required by this division for tree removal of less than 10 trees in an 18 month period. Tree removal requests of more than 10 trees will be require a simplified tree protection and tree conservation plan. A lot containing a detached single-family dwelling that does not meet the minimum tree canopy coverage requirements of this article shall not remove any trees unless tree removal is compensated with tree planting that will at maturity provide tree canopy equivalent to that removed.
(e) Inspections, determinations and authorizations. The community development director may upon request of a property owner inspect trees proposed to be removed. The director may issue letters of determination or authorization upon request of a property owner, indicating whether the contemplated removal of trees is in compliance with this section and this article generally. This development code authorizes enforcement in cases where noncompliance is determined.

Division IV. Street Trees.
Sec. 12-31. Street Trees Required for New Streets.
(a) Required. Independent of and in addition to all other requirements of this article, street trees are required along all new public and private streets.
(b) Public streets. When a new public street is developed as a part of subdivision, the subdivider shall install street trees in accordance with this division and as indicated in an approved application for preliminary plat, prior to the dedication of the public street.
(c) Private streets. When a new private street is developed as part of a subdivision or land development, the subdivider or land developer shall install street trees in accordance with this division and as indicated in an approved application for preliminary plat or development permit, at the time specified in the approved plat or plan application.
(d) Agreement to defer. The city may accept an alternative arrangement where some but not all of the responsibility to plant street trees is deferred to builders, homeowners associations, and/or individual lot owners. In cases where an agreement to defer street tree planting is approved by the city, the entity named responsible for the planting of street trees shall install them in accordance with this division and as indicated in any specifications made a part of the agreement. Any such agreement shall be in a form acceptable to the city attorney.
Sec. 12-32. Location of Street Trees.
(a) Street trees shall be planted within the right-of-way of the street or, where the right-of-way width is insufficient to accommodate street trees or there is no assigned right-of-way for a private street, street trees may be planted on private property; provided, however, that the city may require an easement dedicated to the city for street trees planted on private property abutting public or private streets. (see Figure 12-6)
(b) Actual locations of individual street trees shall be subject to approval of the city. The public works director must authorize all street tree plantings as not in conflict with street, sidewalk utility, and line-of-sight functions. Street trees shall not be allowed which obstruct the vision of motorist or that encroach into vision clearance zones or required sight visibility triangles. Root barriers for street trees shall be installed where roots threaten to cause sidewalk to buckle (see Figure 12-6 for detail).
(c) Street trees shall not be planted within 30 feet of the intersection of public or private streets; within 20 feet of street light and utility poles; within 10 feet of existing walls, fences, signs, driveways, or fire hydrants; or within 5 feet of existing underground utility corridors and sidewalks.
(d) Street trees shall be spaced at appropriate intervals considering the canopy size and height of the tree at maturity. Generally, this means that there should be a minimum
Article 12, Tree Protection, Buffers, and Landscaping, Powder Springs Unified Development Code

Sec. 12-33. Specifications for Street Trees.
(a) Number and spacing. One street tree shall be planted along every street frontage at a quantity equal to one tree per 40 feet of property frontage. Normally, this will mean the street trees are planted, thus being distributed more or less evenly along the street frontage for maximum shade coverage. However, line-of-sight requirements at street intersections and driveways may necessitate modification of the spacing and exact location of street trees. Furthermore, a more informal tree grouping of street trees may be approved rather than rows with equal spacing of street trees.
(b) Accommodation of existing trees. Where one or more healthy trees already exist along the street frontage in such a way as to obviate the need for street tree planting, the city may waive or partially waive the tree centering requirement.
(c) Species. Street trees shall be selected from the species listed on the Powder Springs Tree Species List. The community development director in consultation with the Tree Commission may establish specific priorities and the species type or mixture of species type which if specified shall be followed. The director with consultation by the Tree Commission may also authorize species not on the Powder Springs Tree Species List to be planted as street trees.
(d) Root barriers. The street tree plan shall propose, and the community development director shall require, installation of root barriers, in accordance with manufacturers specifications, when trees are planted within five feet of a sidewalk, curb, paved surface, or underground utility corridor. Street trees installed between a sidewalk and curb and gutter shall require root barriers along both the sidewalk and the curb. Street trees installed between an underground utility corridor and a sidewalk shall require root barriers along both the utility corridor and the sidewalk. The street tree plan shall identify all street trees that require installation of root barriers. The linear distance of the root barrier shall be determined based on the critical root zone of the tree at maturity but in most instances shall be no less than 20 feet in length (10 feet from the trunk of the tree in each direction) parallel to the improvement to be protected.
(e) Material and depth specifications for root barriers. Street tree root barriers can be made of durable high-density polyethylene or thick plastic, metal, or herbicide-impregnated cloth, buried vertically in the soil. Effective depths depend upon soil texture. Usually 18 to 24 inches in vertical depth is required for protection. Install root barriers by trenching along the area to be protected. See Figure 12-6. Root Barrier Detail.
Sec. 12-34. City Authority to Plant and Care for Street Trees.
(a) While the responsibility for planting and maintaining street trees is assigned to private parties, the City of Powder Springs shall have the right to plant, prune, maintain and remove trees, plants and shrubs within the right-of-way of all streets, alleys, avenues,
Article 12, Tree Protection, Buffers, and Landscaping, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
381
lanes, squares and public grounds, as may be necessary to insure public safety and maintenance of street trees and landscaping.
(b) No person shall plant, spray, fertilize, prune, remove or otherwise disturb any tree on any street right-of-way or public property without first securing written permission from the City.
(c) It shall be unlawful for any person or firm to top or severely prune any street tree, or other tree on public property.
[Secs. 12-35 to 12-40 Reserved].
Division V. Buffers Between Incompatible Uses.
Sec. 12-41. Required.
(a) Buffers shall be established as required by this development code and any applicable conditions of zoning or other development approvals.
(b) A buffer shall be required between any multi-family or nonresidential development project along a side or rear lot line that abuts a less intense land use, as provided in Table 12-2.

Sec. 12-42. Buffer Specifications.
(a) When required. Buffers required by this division shall be established at the time of construction of any new development on the lot for which a buffer is required by this division.
Article 12, Tree Protection, Buffers, and Landscaping, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
382
(b) Width. The width of the buffer shall be as specified in this development code, except as otherwise specifically permitted to be reduced in accordance with this division.
(c) Undisturbed. Buffers required by this division shall remain undisturbed, except where necessary to add vegetation to meet screening requirements, unless encroachments are specifically authorized by this section.
(d) Screening. The buffer must be sufficiently dense to substantially obstruct the view (i.e., near maximum opacity) from the normal level of a first-story window on an abutting lot from the ground to a minimum height of six (6) feet, within two growing seasons. Where the existing vegetation within a required buffer does not achieve the desired screening, additional trees and shrubs shall be installed in accordance with the specifications of Table 12-3; provided, however, that the community development director may approve modifications to the specifications of Table 12-3, including the incorporation of deciduous vegetation within the buffer, when the application of alternative planting specifications achieves an equivalent or greater amount of year-round screening.
Table 12-3
Planting Specifications by Required Buffer Width
Width of Required Buffer
Planting Specification
10 feet
One row of evergreen shrubs having a minimum height of six feet, planted four (4) feet on center and one row of evergreen trees having a minimum height of eight feet with branching to the ground and planted 30 feet on center.
20 feet
Two staggered rows of evergreen trees having a minimum height of eight feet with branching to the ground and planted 30 feet on center.
30 feet
Three staggered rows of evergreen trees having a minimum height of eight feet with branching to the ground and planted 30 feet on center.
40 feet
Four staggered rows of evergreen trees having a minimum height of eight feet with branching to the ground and planted 30 feet on center.
Over 40 feet
Four staggered rows of evergreen trees plus one additional staggered row for each 10 additional feet of buffer width.
(e) Encroachments. Required buffer areas shall contain no driveways, parking areas, patios, stormwater detention facilities, or any other structures or accessory uses, except that a fence or wall may in certain instances be erected as provided in Sec. 12-43 as alternative compliance to meet the visual screening required to meet the buffer requirements of this development code. Underground utilities may be permitted to cross a buffer if the screening standards of this development code will be subsequently achieved. Vehicular access through a buffer may be allowed only by approval of the Mayor and City Council.
(f) Protection. Natural buffers required by this division shall be protected during land development and construction in accordance with the tree protection provisions of this article.
Article 12, Tree Protection, Buffers, and Landscaping, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
383
Sec. 12-43. Buffer Width Reduction.
(a) Reduction. The community development director may approve a reduction in the required buffer width to a width of no less than 75 percent of the buffer width otherwise required, but no less than 10 feet; provided that a six-foot high fence or masonry wall is installed along the innermost portion of a required buffer and not on the property line.
(b) Fencing. If fencing is authorized to be utilized in a buffer, the fence must be constructed of rot-resistant material or protected from deterioration with water-proofing material. The finished or decorative face of the fence shall be oriented toward the exterior of the property (abutting site to be screened) rather than the interior of the property on which the fence is located. Fences must be maintained in good order and shall be replaced if damaged or repaired if in disrepair.
(c) Earthen berm. If an earthen berm is authorized to be established in lieu of a full-width buffer, the earthen berm shall have a maximum side slope of 50% (1 foot of vertical rise to 2 feet of horizontal run). Earthen berms shall not be constructed within the drip line of any existing trees that will remain on the property.
Sec. 12-44. Buffer Waiver.
The Mayor and City Council may waive a buffer requirement or reduce its extent to a temporarily appropriate level of screening if the comprehensive plan anticipates future development on the adjoining property in a land use category such that a buffer would not be required by this development code once the adjoining property is rezoned or developed.
Sec. 12-45. Buffer Maintenance.
Every required buffer shall be maintained by the owner of the property where the buffer is located, so as to provide an opaque visual screen to a height of 6 feet on a continuous, year-round basis.
[Secs. 12-46 to 12-50 Reserved].
Article 12, Tree Protection, Buffers, and Landscaping, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
384
Division VI. Landscaping.
Sec. 12-51. When Required.
(a) The landscaping requirements of this division shall apply to all land uses for which a development permit or building permit is required to be issued, except for lots containing detached, single-family or two-family dwellings.
(b) The exemption of individual lots containing detached, single-family and two-family dwellings shall not be construed to exempt the filing of a landscape plan for residential subdivision entrances and/or landscaping installation on common areas within such subdivision.
Sec. 12-52. Front Landscape Strip.
(a) Width required. A front landscape strip with an average width as specified in article 2, Table 2-4, for the zoning district in which the property is located, is required and shall be installed prior to a certificate of occupancy, except that this section shall not apply to lots containing detached, single-family and two-family dwellings, regardless of zoning district and notwithstanding the requirements of article 2, table 2-4. The community development director may permit existing natural vegetation of comparable width to be retained and can allow such natural vegetation to satisfy the requirements of this section.
(b) Frontage landscaped. Required front landscape strips shall be installed in accordance with this section along the entire property line fronting the street, except for approved access crossings.
(c) Variation. The width of a required landscape strip may be varied, provided that the total area within the front landscape strip provided meets or exceeds the amount of landscaped area as would be achieved if the average width front landscape strip were planted; provided, however, that no required front landscape strip shall be reduced to a width of less than three feet. The purpose of varying the width of the required front landscape strip is to accommodate such features as sidewalks connecting to the public street, fire hydrants or other public improvements if located within an easement on private property, and signs. Within the area counted as a front landscape strip, decorative walls or other decorative features may be approved by the community development director.
(d) Relation to tree canopy and street trees. The required front landscape strip shall be the priority location for the planting of trees as may be required to comply with division II (Canopy) of this article and in some cases to comply with division IV (Street Trees) of this article. Each front landscape strip shall have canopy trees planted at 40 foot on center for the entire length except for approved access crossings. It may be necessary to provide a wider front landscape strip than that required by this development code in order to provide canopy trees, in which case a front landscape strip width should be varied to provide wider planting spaces for canopy trees and street trees, while narrowing the width
Article 12, Tree Protection, Buffers, and Landscaping, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
385
(no less than 3 feet) of the front landscape strip in other portions to meet the required average.
(e) Parking lot hedge screen. All vehicle parking lots with five spaces or more abutting or within 20 feet of a public or private street right-of-way shall be screened by planting (in addition to canopy trees) 10 shrubs for every 40 linear feet of street frontage, excluding driveways.
(f) Alternative screens. The community development director may approve other methods of screening vehicle parking lots with five spaces or more abutting or within 20 feet of a public or private street right-of-way, when the planting of shrubs conflicts with priorities for tree canopy. Alternatives include but are not limited to the following: using existing natural vegetation retained and supplemented as necessary with vegetation where sparsely vegetated to form an effective screen; an earth berm three feet above the finished grade of the parking lot nearest the street as measured at the crest of the berm, with five shrubs planted for every 40 linear feet of street frontage excluding driveways; or a brick, stone, or finished concrete wall having a minimum height of three feet, in combination with five shrubs planted for every 40 linear feet of street frontage excluding driveways. Combinations of these options along lengthier frontages are to be encouraged to achieve the objective of maintaining and enhancing tree canopy.
(g) Stormwater best management practices (BMPs). Stormwater BMPs may be applied or incorporated within front landscaping strips, and a front landscaping strip may if appropriate be accepted as a BMP.
Sec. 12-53. Side Landscaping Strip.
(a) Landscaping alongside or paralleling side lot lines is optional, but landscaping areas large enough to accommodate individual trees or tree stands should be provided where necessary to meet tree canopy coverage requirements of this article.
(b) If vehicle parking lots with 5 spaces or more will be visible from the fronting street along the side property line, a parking lot hedge screen or another alternative screen along that visible edge of the vehicle parking lot will be required and shall be installed.
(c) One canopy tree shall be provided for each 40 feet of side landscaping length, if side landscaping is provided.
(d) Stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) may be applied or incorporated within side landscaping strips, and a side landscaping strip may if appropriate be accepted as a BMP.
Article 12, Tree Protection, Buffers, and Landscaping, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
386
Sec. 12-54. Interior Parking Lot Landscaping.
(a) Tree canopy cover in parking areas. One parking lot canopy tree for each ten parking spaces is required and shall be installed; provided, however, that a parking lot consisting of fewer than ten spaces may incorporate the required parking lot trees around its perimeter. No more than 10 contiguous parking spaces shall be allowed without a minimum of one landscape island or peninsula containing trees. Existing trees if retained may qualify for parking lot canopy trees. (see Figure 12-8)
Figure 12-8. Illustrative Parking Lot Landscaping.
(b) Minimum dimension of landscape islands. A landscape island shall have a minimum width of nine feet and minimum depth of 16 feet measured from interior face of curb to interior face of curb; however, wider (12 or more feet) landscaping islands are strongly encouraged and may be required to provide sufficient growing area for certain canopy tree species selected. (See Figure 12-9).
Article 12, Tree Protection, Buffers, and Landscaping, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
387
Figure 12-9. Parking Lot Landscaping Island Detail
(c) Minimum planting. Each landscape island shall contain a minimum of one canopy tree having a minimum caliper of three inches at the time of planting. Saved trees may also qualify for meeting these interior parking lot tree canopy requirements.
(d) Setback for tree planting. No canopy tree shall be planted within four feet of the edge of parking lot pavement or curb.
(e) Size of canopy tree. Large canopy trees shall be planting in interior islands or peninsulas if adequate root area can be provided. However, one medium canopy tree may be planted in a landscape island or peninsula with a minimum dimension of nine feet by 16 feet. Where parking lots are designed with a parking lot end island that is nine feet by 32 to 36 feet, the end island may be planted with either one large canopy tree or two medium canopy trees.
(f) Stormwater infiltration. The surface of landscaped islands shall be slightly concave, to promote stormwater infiltration. In addition, approval may be granted for parking lots designed such that stormwater is directed to one or more interior parking lot landscaping islands to facilitate infiltration.
(g) Location. Unless required otherwise by this article, the location of landscape islands may occur at the end of parking bays, and as extensions to front or side landscape strips. Trees shall not be allowed which obstruct the vision of a motorist or that encroach into vision clearance zones or required sight visibility triangles.
(h) Planting strips. Planting strips in the interior of a parking lot are encouraged and may be required in parking lots of 24 or more spaces, in order to ensure adequate distribution of tree canopy coverage on the development site. When such a parking strip is provided, it
Article 12, Tree Protection, Buffers, and Landscaping, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
388
shall have a minimum width of nine feet from interior face of curb to interior face of curb to accommodate trees.
Sec. 12-55. General Landscaping Provisions.
(a) Landscaping obstructions to sight visibility and clearance. Landscaping shall not obstruct the view of motorists or pedestrians, e.g., shrubs planted in inappropriate locations or maintained at an inappropriate height, or low hanging branches of trees. Trees shall be pruned to yield a clear trunk a minimum of eight feet above finished grade to allow safe clearance beneath the tree. (Figure 12-10)

(b) Native plants. The use of native plants is encouraged.
(c) Invasive species. Invasive or potentially invasive plants are prohibited. See Appendix A of this article for a list of invasive species not authorized to be used.
(d) Shrubs in relation to trees. The planting of perennial shrubs, herbaceous plants, turf, sod or ground cover is limited to the outer two-thirds of a tree protection zone for a saved tree and no closer than 2-1/2 feet from the trunk of a planted tree.
(e) Xeriscaping and water conservation. Xeriscaping is encouraged. Ground covers should be used to supplement landscaping in appropriate areas to reduce extensive grass lawns that require regular watering in drought conditions.
(f) Grass. Grass lawn areas should be sodded. However, if grass seed must be used, it shall be a variety suitable to the area that produces complete coverage.
(g) Artificial landscaping. No artificial plants, trees or other vegetation shall be installed.
(h) Root barriers. Such barriers shall be installed as prescribed in Sec. 12-33 in all site landscaping applications.
Sec. 12-56. Landscape Plan Required.
(a) A landscape plan prepared by a qualified professional shall be required for all development subject to the requirements of this division.
Article 12, Tree Protection, Buffers, and Landscaping, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
389
(b) Landscaping plans are subject to approval by the city prior to issuance of a development or building permit to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this article.
(c) Landscaping plans will typically be reviewed and approved by the city during the process of issuing a development permit, or if no development permit is required, a building permit.
(d) The landscaping plan shall be prepared in conjunction with preparation of the tree protection and planting plan required by this article. The landscaping plan may be presented as a separate drawing from the tree protection and planting plan required by Sec. 12-22 of this article; if presented on separate sheets, the landscaping plan shall be consistent and not present any conflicts with the tree protection and planting plan.
Sec. 12-57. Contents of Landscape Plans.
A landscape plan required by this division shall include the following, unless the community development director waives certain submission requirements:
(a) Location and type of existing vegetation, including the location of all specimen trees;
(b) Existing vegetation to be saved;
(c) Methods and details for protecting existing vegetation during construction, including tree save areas;
(d) Locations and labels for all proposed plants in relation to driveways, parking areas, buildings, easements, rights-of-ways, and tree save areas.
(e) A plant list showing the proposed quantities of shrubs, ground cover, vines, or other planted materials and, if applicable, minimum required quantities;
(f) Location and description of other landscape improvements, such as earth berms, walls, or fences, if proposed;
(g) Reference shall be made to the boundary survey on which the plan is based;
(h) The plan shall be prepared at an engineering scale;
(i) The plan shall be stamped with professional seal and signed by a landscape architect, unless the community development director accepts a landscape plan prepared by another qualified professional.

(d) Each speaker may speak only to the proposed application under consideration and shall address his or her remarks only to the hearing body. Each speaker shall refrain from personal attacks on any other speaker or the discussion of facts or opinions irrelevant to the proposed application under consideration. The presiding official may limit or refuse a speaker the right to continue if, after first being cautioned, the speaker continues to violate this procedure.
(e) Upon conclusion of the applicants presentation, others in support of the application may then speak, followed by those in opposition to the application. Those present who are neither opposed or in favor of the application but who have question will speak during the time afforded the opposition.

Division VI. Development of Regional Impact.
Sec. 13-81. Definitions.
Initial DRI information form: A form intended to identify basic information about a proposed development of regional impact on which a local government is being requested to take action, and which provides information to the regional commission. This form notifies the regional commission of a potential development of regional impact in order for the commission to meet its responsibilities within the DRI review process.
DRI Review initiation request form: A form intended to provide additional information about the proposed project to the regional commission, the submission of which serves as an official request that the DRI review process be started by the commission.
Regional commission: The Atlanta Regional Commission, or any successor or subsequent agency with jurisdiction for development of regional impact applications.
Sec. 13-82. Applicability.
This division shall apply when an applicant (industry, business, or developer) requests some type of local government action related to a project, such as, but not limited to, a request for rezoning, conditional use, variance, permit, hookup to a water or sewer system, master or site plan approval, or entering into a contract, and it appears that the proposed development (or, for multi-phased projects, the complete development) meets the threshold(s) of a development of regional impact, according to Rules of Georgia Department of Community Affairs, Chapter 110-12-3, Developments of Regional Impact, effective March 1, 2014, as may be amended from time to time.
Sec. 13-83. Jurisdiction.
Article 13, Zoning Amendments and Procedures, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
419
If a proposed development project is to be located in more than one jurisdiction and, in total, the proposed development meets or exceeds a DRI threshold, the local government in which the largest portion of the project is to be located is responsible for initiating the DRI review process.
Sec. 13-84. Procedures.
The application procedures established in this development code will be modified by this division in cases where a rezoning request, conditional use application or variance application fits the definition of a development of regional impact. Developments of regional impact will be processed according to procedures of the Georgia Department of Community Affairs as described in Rules of Georgia Department of Community Affairs, Chapter 110-12-3, Developments of Regional Impact, effective March 1, 2014, as may be amended from time to time.
When an application is received for development that meets or exceeds the thresholds established for that development type and thus constitutes a development of regional impact according to the aforementioned Rules of the Georgia Department of Community Affairs, the City will follow the procedures identified in said administrative rules which are summarized here.
(a) When an application for a development of regional impact is received, the community development director will complete an Initial DRI Information form and a DRI Review Initiation Request form. Each of these two forms may be submitted to the regional commission simultaneously, provided the City has all necessary project-related information.
(b) The City shall not take any official legislative or administrative action to advance or further a DRI project until the review process identified under the DRI review procedure specified in Rules of Georgia Department of Community Affairs, Chapter 110-12-3, Developments of Regional Impact, effective March 1, 2014, as may be amended from time to time, is completed. The City may undertake preliminary staff administrative functions associated with a proposed DRI including, but not limited to, project evaluation/assessment, site visits, and placing consideration of the application on a future agenda for formal action, if required. The City shall not take any official action related to such a project until the DRI review process is completed and the City has had adequate time to consider the DRI review comments.
(c) After the DRI review process is completed, the city may proceed with whatever action it deems appropriate regarding the proposed project, although it is encouraged to take the public finding and additional comments into consideration as it makes its decision.
(d) If the project receives a negative public finding from the Regional Commission and the City approves said project or takes action to advance said project, the City shall notify the regional commission and the Georgia Department of Community Affairs of its action and
Article 13, Zoning Amendments and Procedures, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
420
identify all local requirements it has placed on the development that could mitigate any negative findings identified in the DRI review process.

(e) The community development director shall review the application for completeness within 5 working days of submission. Incomplete or improper applications will be returned to the applicant.
Sec. 14-5. Stay of Proceedings.
The filing of a completed application for an appeal of an administrative decision stays all legal proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the community development director certifies to the governing body, after the notice of appeal shall has been filed, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not be stayed unless the applicant for appeal of an administrative decision secures an order from a court of competent jurisdiction.
Sec. 14-6. Appeal Procedures.
(a) Assembly of record. Upon receiving a complete and timely application for an appeal, the community development director or his/her designee shall assemble such memos, papers, plans, or other documents as may constitute the record for the appeal or as may provide an understanding of the issues involved.

423
exists. The governing body may interpret such provisions of this development code as may require clarification or extension in specific cases.

Sec. 14-31. Public Hearing Notice  Surrounding Property Owners.

Sec. 15-25. Preliminary Plat Review and Approval Process.
The community development director is responsible for administering the review and approval process for preliminary subdivision plats, which shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this article. The procedures of this section, which are described as follows, may be supplemented by the community development director where additional specification is required.
(a) Review for completeness and application acceptance. The community development department shall review the application for completeness within no more than 10 calendar work days from the time of submission. Incomplete applications will not be processed and will be returned to the applicant.
(b) Distribution and agency review of preliminary plat. The community development department shall promptly forward a copy of the complete preliminary plat application to other city departments as may be appropriate, the Georgia Department of Transportation if the proposed subdivision has frontage on or proposes access to a state or federal road, or others as appropriate, for their review and comment. Agency review shall specifically include the approval from the Cobb County Health Department if septic tanks are proposed and public utility providers in cases where connection to public water and/or sewer is proposed or required.
(c) Time period for completion of review. Within no more 25 calendar work days following the date the application was determined complete, during which agency review shall be completed, the community development department shall indicate on the preliminary plat or in writing all comments related to compliance with this article and the development code. The community development department shall also review the
Article 15, Subdivision of Land, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
446
preliminary plat for compliance with policies of the comprehensive plan. The department shall provide all comments to the applicant for resolution, who shall work with each department as necessary to resolve all issues.
(d) Action. When the department of community development has determined that the preliminary subdivision plat is in compliance with the requirements of this development code and consistent with the comprehensive plan, it shall be approved. The owner shall be responsible for compliance with all codes, regulations, and zoning requirements and for the satisfaction of all the noted and written comments. If it is determined that the preliminary plat is not in compliance or is inconsistent in one or more respects with the policies of the comprehensive plan or the requirements of this development code, the department shall disapprove or may conditionally approve the preliminary plat such that it is consistent with the comprehensive plan and meets all applicable requirements of this development code. Action must be taken by the department to approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the preliminary plat application within no more than 60 days from receipt of a completed application. Applications that are disapproved may be revised and resubmitted; if more than 90 days elapses from the date action was taken by the department, the applicant shall be required to file a new preliminary plat application and pay an additional application fee.
(e) Variances. The community development department shall not approve any preliminary plat that would result in a lot or situation that would clearly require a variance, until or unless such variance is lawfully obtained. An application for variance submitted after submission of the preliminary plat application will extend the time frame for action as specified in this section.
Article 15, Subdivision of Land, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
447
(f) Certificate of preliminary plat approval. Upon approval of the preliminary plat, the community development director or his or her designee and the public works director or his or her designee shall sign and date the certificate of preliminary plat approval stamped or printed on a reproducible copy of the preliminary subdivision plat. One copy of the approved drawing shall be transmitted to the applicant and the community development department shall retain additional copies for distribution to the department of public works and other agencies as may be appropriate.
Sec. 15-26. Duration of Preliminary Plat Approval.
Preliminary plat approval shall remain in effect for a period of 1 consecutive year, after which time it shall become null and void and a new certificate of preliminary plat approval may be required if no permit has been issued or no development activity has begun.
Sec. 15-27. Revision of a Preliminary Plat.
The community development director, in consultation with the director of public works when engineering or utility considerations are involved, is authorized to approve minor amendments to preliminary plats (i.e., those that do not affect the public or private street configuration or that reconfigure lots and which do not increase the number of lots), without the need to reapply for preliminary plat approval. The application requirements and procedures for amending preliminary plats, unless minor in nature, shall be the same as for preliminary plat applications.
Sec. 15-28. Land Development Following Preliminary Plat Approval.
The community development director may authorize a development permit for the land to be subdivided only after a preliminary plat, if required, is approved. The property owner shall submit an application for development permit and submit all required plans and other information required for development and improvement. See article 8 of this development code.
[Secs. 15-29 and 15-30 Reserved].
Division IV. Standards for Blocks and Lots.
Sec. 15-31. Suitability of Land.
Land physically unsuitable for subdivision because of flooding, poor drainage, steep slopes, rock formations or other such features that may endanger health, life or property, aggravate erosion, increase flood hazard, or necessitate excessive expenditures of public funds for supply and maintenance of services shall not be approved for subdivision or development unless adequate methods are formulated by the subdivider for solving the problems.
Article 15, Subdivision of Land, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
448
Sec. 15-32. Conformance with Comprehensive Plan.
All proposed subdivisions shall conform to the comprehensive plan and development policies in effect at the time of submission to the community development director. All highways, streets and other improvements recommended in the comprehensive plan shall be platted by the developer in the location and to the dimension indicated in the comprehensive plan.
When features of other plans adopted by the Mayor and City Council (such as schools or other public-building sites, parks or other land for public uses) are located in whole or in part in a subdivision, such features shall be either dedicated or reserved by the subdivider for acquisition within a reasonable time by the appropriate public agency.
Sec. 15-33. Block Length.
Intersecting streets shall be provided at such intervals so as to provide adequate cross traffic and connectivity. Blocks in residential subdivisions should not exceed 1800 feet nor be less than 600 feet in length, except where topography or other conditions justify a departure from these standards. In blocks longer than 800 feet, pedestrian ways and/or easements through the block shall be required near the center of blocks. In addition, for blocks longer than 800 feet in length, the community development director may require one or more public easements of not less than 20 feet in width to extend entirely across the block for fire protection or utilities.
Sec. 15-34. Block Width.
The width of a block shall be sufficient to allow two tiers of lots of appropriate depth, except where reverse frontage lots on arterial streets are provided, or when prevented by topographic conditions or size of the property, or for lots along the periphery of the subdivision, in which case the community development director may approve a single row of lots.
Article 15, Subdivision of Land, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
449
Blocks intended for business or industrial use shall be of such width as to be considered most suitable for their respective use, including adequate space for off-street parking, deliveries, and service.
Sec. 15-35. Lot Depth.
The depth of lots intended for detached, single-family residential shall not be greater than four times the width of the lot at the regulatory building line, unless unusual circumstances make these limitations not practicable. Lots intended for other uses should observe this maximum lot depths standard where practicable.
Sec. 15-36. Adequate Building Site.
Each lot shall contain an adequate building site not subject to flooding and outside the limits of any existing easements or required building setback lines.
Sec. 15-37. Lot Lines.
All side lot lines shall be perpendicular to street lines, and all rear lot lines shall be parallel or radial to street lines, unless not practicable because of topographic or other features.
Sec. 15-38. Double Frontage Lots.
Double frontage lots shall be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or overcome specific disadvantages of topography or orientation. The community development director may require a no-access, planting screen easement of at least 10 feet, across which there shall be no right of access, along the line of lots abutting such a traffic artery or other disadvantageous use.
Sec. 15-39. Flag Lots.
Flag lots, which meet minimum lot area requirements and meet the minimum lot width at the front building setback line where the building is placed, may be allowed where conditions of hardship make standard design or frontage impossible, impractical, or inefficient with regard to land use. Where such lots are allowed, the street frontage of each panhandle portion of the lot shall not be less than 30 feet wide, and the panhandle portion of the lot shall be no less than 30 feet wide and not more than 200 feet long. Not more than two such panhandle access points shall abut each other. The community development director may require shared driveways for abutting flag lots.
Sec. 15-40. Lot Remnants Not Permitted.
All remnants of lots less than the required minimum lot size which may be left over after subdividing a larger tract, must be added to adjacent lots, rather than allowed to remain as unusable or noncompliant parcels. The community development director may permit a lot
Article 15, Subdivision of Land, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
450
remnant for a specific purpose such as a detention pond or buffering, provided that access and design is appropriate and the lot remnant is restricted to specific public, utility, or conservation use.

(b) Concrete monuments with aluminum or brass marking shall be placed at all corners of the exterior boundaries of the subdivision being developed and shall be set flush or up to 6 inches above the finished grade. Existing permanent monuments that, in the professional opinion of a registered land surveyor, are of sufficiently durable construction may be maintained in lieu of a new concrete monument.
(c) Permanent survey monuments shall be installed in accordance with the most recent edition of Section 180-7 .05, Monument, of the Rules of State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors and the Georgia Plat Act (O.C.G.A. 15-6-67).
Sec. 15-53. Reference to Standards.
Public streets, or if authorized, private streets, providing access to the subdivided property and to all lots in a subdivision, including the extension of streets required to provide access to adjoining properties shall be installed in accordance with article 8 and article 21 of this development code. All other required improvements specified in article 8 of this development code shall be provided in a subdivision, including but not limited to traffic control devices, street lighting, sidewalks, stormwater drainage and detention or retention facilities (see article 11), water, fire hydrants, sewer, and other utilities, and all appropriate easements for utilities and facilities (see article 8).
Sec. 15-54. Additional Subdivision Access Standards and Requirements.
(a) When land is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged and designed so as to allow for the opening of future streets and to provide access to those areas not presently served by streets.
Article 15, Subdivision of Land, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
451
(b) A single entrance to a subdivision shall serve no more than 100 lots. Where the property configuration prohibits or makes impractical the installation of two entrances, the public works director may waive this requirement following sound engineering practice.
(c) Where a residential subdivision abuts or contains a State or U.S. numbered highway, a street approximately parallel to such right-of-way shall be constructed as a frontage road to provide access to the lots, or double frontage lots shall be provided. Residential lots in a subdivision shall have no direct access to a State or U.S. numbered highway unless approved by the Georgia Department of Transportation.
Sec. 15-55. Inspections.
It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, or contractor to proceed with land development activities except as inspected for compliance in accordance with the requirements of this development code. Inspections shall be made and passed prior to continuation of further activity or proceeding into new phases. The owner shall be responsible for correcting any deficiencies identified by subdivision and land development inspections prior to approval of a final subdivision plat.
Sec. 15-56. Responsibilities Limited.
(a) Approval of preliminary plats and development plans by the department of community development shall not imply or transfer acceptance of responsibility for the application of the principles of engineering, architecture, landscape architecture, urban planning, or any other profession, from the professional, corporation, or individual under whose hand or supervision the plans were prepared.
(b) The completion of inspections by the City and authorization for work continuation shall not transfer responsibility for the quality of the work performed or materials used from the owner, nor imply or transfer acceptance of responsibility for project design or engineering from the professional, corporation, or individual under whose hand or supervision the plans were prepared.

Division IX. Conservation Subdivisions.
Sec. 15-101. Purposes of Conservation Subdivisions.
The purposes of this division are: to provide for the preservation of greenspace as a nonstructural stormwater runoff and watershed protection measure; to provide a by-right use as of right in selected residential zoning districts that permits flexibility of design in order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land; to preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and wildlife habitat; to permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility easements, necessary for residential development; to reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of vegetation in residential development; to promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the community;
to promote greenspace contiguous with adjacent jurisdictions; to encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the neighborhood; to encourage street designs that reduce traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries; to promote construction of convenient landscaped walking trails and bike paths both within the subdivision and connected to neighboring communities, businesses, and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles; to conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by maximizing the number of houses with direct access to and views of open space; and to preserve important historic and archaeological sites.
Sec. 15-102. Definitions Pertaining to Conservation Subdivisions.
For purposes of this division, the following terms are defined:
Conservation subdivision: A subdivision for detached, single-family dwelling units, each on its own lot, with lot sizes and lot widths which may be less than minimum requirements established for the underlying zoning district, and which ensures that all primary conservation areas and some or most of the secondary conservation areas are permanently protected open space as defined in this section. Conservation subdivisions are like a golf course design without a golf course, where instead conservation areas are used as the unifying design theme. All, or a sizable majority, of the lots contained in a conservation subdivision have a lot boundary that abuts open space, as defined in this section.
Open space: The portion of the conservation subdivision that has been set aside for permanent protection. Activities within the open space are restricted in perpetuity through the use of an approved legal instrument. The only activities and uses that are authorized within open spaces of conservation subdivision are as follows: conservation of natural, archeological or historical resources; meadows, woodlands, wetlands, wildlife corridors, game preserves, or similar conservation-oriented areas; walking or bicycle trails, provided they are constructed of porous paving materials; passive recreation areas; active recreation areas, provided that they are limited to no more than 10 percent of the total open space and are not located within primary
Article 15, Subdivision of Land, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
467
conservation areas as defined in this section; and agriculture, horticulture, silviculture or pasture uses, provided that all applicable best management practices are used to minimize environmental impacts, and such activities are not conducted within primary conservation areas as defined in this section. The community development director may also authorize inclusion of above-ground utility rights-of-ways within areas designated as open space, if such existed on the tract prior to preliminary plat approval; further, easements necessary for drainage, access, and underground utility lines may be authorized by the community development director to be included within the area defined as open space within a conservation subdivision.
Open space management plan: A plan submitted by an applicant for a conservation subdivision that: allocates responsibility and guidelines for the maintenance and operation of open space and any facilities located thereon, including provisions for ongoing maintenance and for long-term capital improvements; estimates the costs and staffing requirements needed for maintenance and operation of, and insurance for, the open space and outlines the means by which such funding will be obtained or provided; provides that any changes to the plan be approved by the community development director; and, provides for enforcement of the plan.
Primary conservation areas: The regulatory 100-year floodplain; buffer zones of at least 75 feet in width along all perennial and intermittent streams; slopes above 25 percent of at least 5,000 square feet contiguous area; wetlands that meet the definition used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers pursuant to the Clean Water Act; populations of endangered or threatened species, or habitat for such species; and, archaeological sites, cemeteries and burial grounds.
Secondary conservation areas: important historic sites; existing healthy, native forests of at least one acre contiguous area; individual existing healthy trees greater than 8 inches caliper, as measured from their outermost drip line; other significant natural features and scenic viewsheds such as ridge lines, peaks and rock outcroppings, particularly those that can be seen from public roads; prime agricultural lands of at least five acres contiguous area; and, existing trails that connect the tract to neighboring areas.
Sec. 15-103. Conservation Subdivision  Where Permitted.
A conservation subdivision is a use by right in R15, R20, R30, and MDR zoning districts, subject to compliance with all other provisions of this development code and all other applicable laws, except those that are specifically exempted from applicability in this division.
Sec. 15-104. Conservation Subdivision Density, Lot Size and Lot Width.
Minimum lot sizes, minimum lot widths, and maximum density of the residential zoning district in which the conservation subdivision is located, as specified in Table 2-2 of this development code, shall not apply to conservation subdivisions.
No lot shall be platted in a conservation subdivision that is less than 50% of the required lot size or lot width for the zoning district in which it is located, as specified in Table 2-2. The maximum density for a detached, single-family residential development within a conservation subdivision
Article 15, Subdivision of Land, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
468
shall not exceed 120% of the maximum density established for the zoning district in which it is located, as specified in Table 2-2.
Sec. 15-105. Building Setbacks in Conservation Subdivisions.
Detached single-family dwellings on lots within a conservation subdivision shall not be subject to the minimum setbacks for principal buildings from street rights-of-ways and rear lot lines as established in Table 2-2 for the zoning district in which the conservation subdivision is located. Front and rear setbacks for lots within conservation subdivisions shall be as approved and shown on an approved preliminary plat; provided, however, that no front or rear setback shall be less than 50% of the front or rear setback, as the case may be, required for the zoning district in which the conservation subdivision is located.
All lots within conservation subdivisions shall remain subject to the required minimum principal building setback from side property lines as established in Table 2-2 for the zoning district in which the conservation subdivision is located, with no reductions permitted except by variance.
Sec. 15-106. Exceptions to Improvement Requirements for Conservation Subdivisions.
Certain improvement requirements of this development code are established with conventional suburban subdivisions in mind and therefore may be considered incompatible with the character of a conservation subdivision. Accordingly, the following waiver of certain requirements of this development code shall be permitted, as follows:
(a) Private Open Spaces and Recreational Amenity in MDR districts. When located within a Medium Density Residential zoning district, conservation subdivisions shall not require private open space and a recreational amenity as specified in Sec. 2-14 of this development code.
(b) Architectural appearance requirements. Conservation subdivision applicants shall describe and provide examples of the architectural appearance of detached, single-family residences to be constructed within the conservation subdivision, and the community development director may require compliance with certain standards of architectural appearance (specified in Article 5) via restrictive covenants.
(c) Low impact development in place of curb and gutter. Because curbs detract from rural character of subdivisions, natural drainage systems are encouraged in lieu of curbs. Conservation subdivisions may be authorized by the public works director to use low impact development methods of stormwater management in lieu of curb and gutter on subdivision streets.
(d) Unpaved trails in place of concrete sidewalks. A system of unpaved trails may be authorized by the community development director in lieu of concrete sidewalks required for conventional subdivisions, as specified in article 8 of this development code; provided, however, that such alternative pedestrian facilities, shall provide more or less
Article 15, Subdivision of Land, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
469
the same distance, and equal accessibility to that which would be obtained with the application of the conventional sidewalk requirements.
No other deviations from improvement requirements established in this development code shall be authorized administratively; any other such deviations shall be by variance approved in accordance with article 14 of this development code.
Sec. 15-107. Review and Approval Process for Conservation Subdivisions.
Conservation subdivisions shall be reviewed and approved and processed as if they were a conventional subdivision, thus being subject to all other provisions of this article except as specifically indicated otherwise.
An application for preliminary plat for a conservation subdivision shall meet all requirements specified in this article for a preliminary plat, and in addition, shall provide a separate site analysis map which delineates all primary conservation areas and secondary conservation areas, as defined in this division, on the tract to be subdivided. The site analysis map shall be prepared by a qualified professional and shall document sources used in preparing the site analysis map. Priorities for conserving or developing secondary conservation areas should be based on an understanding of what features of the given property are more special, unique, irreplaceable, environmentally valuable, historic, scenic, or otherwise significant when compared with other similar features and in relationship to neighboring parcels.
Sec. 15-108. Specifications for Open Space in Conservation Subdivisions.
(a) Percentage of site. A conservation subdivision shall provide at least 40% of the total area to be subdivided as permanently protected open space.
(b) Contiguity requirement. At least 60% of the permanently protected open space shall be provided in a single, contiguous tract.
(c) Minimum area of any isolated open space tract. Portions of open space not part of the single contiguous tract specified in (b) above shall be an area of at least one contiguous acre; the purpose of this requirement is to prevent the platting of small, scattered open spaces that would not functionally contribute to the overall open space network of the subdivision and surrounding area.
(d) Width. The width of any open space tract should be, at minimum, sufficient to accommodate a path, given the existing terrain, the center of which is at least 25 feet from any property line. In cases other than where the open space serves exclusively to provide a buffer or trail, open space tracts should not have a length-to-width ratio in excess of 4:1. The purpose of this width requirement is to ensure open spaces provide suitable wildlife habitat.
(e) Name. Each open space shall be given a name appropriate to its purpose and design. Acceptable identifying types of names for open spaces include but are not limited to
Article 15, Subdivision of Land, Powder Springs Unified Development Code
470
common, park, green, meadow, woods, farm, and historic site, subject to the approval of the community development director.
(f) Connectivity to greater open space system. When a conservation subdivision site abuts an existing conservation area, park, nature preserve, or public undeveloped land, the length of the common boundary between the abutting conservation area and open space within the conservation subdivision should be maximized to the greatest extent possible.
Sec. 15-109. Open Space Management Plan Required.
An open space management plan, as defined, shall be prepared and submitted by the subdivider and must be approved by the community development director prior to the issuance of a development permit for the conservation subdivision. The subdivider must identify in the open space management plan the owner of the open space who is responsible for maintaining the open space and facilities located thereon. No later than the time a final plat is approved, an instrument of permanent protection, such as a conservation easement or permanent restrictive covenant, shall be placed on the open space within the conservation subdivision.
