PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete codification of the ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted by the city council and is the first such codification for the City of Forrest City since 1940. 
    As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, this Code supersedes all ordinances not included herein or expressly saved from repeal by the Adopting Ordinance. The Code contains only ordinances of a general and permanent nature prescribed for and affecting the public as a whole. Special ordinances or ordinances dealing with only a portion of the inhabitants of the City, rather than all of them, or relating to special purposes, such as ordinances levying special assessments, providing for bond issues, paving, vacating and opening specified streets, etc., are not included herein. For more specific enumeration of the type of ordinances which are not included herein, see Section 3 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been appropriately catchlined to facilitate usage. Appropriate footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. Also, the source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the fourteenth section of Chapter 20 is 20-14. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and, at the same time, new sections, or even whole chapters, can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between Sections 4-4 and 4-5 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-4.1, 4-4.2, 4-4.3, respectively. 
    New chapters may be included by the addition of a capital letter after the chapter number, e.g., if the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12A. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this looseleaf system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Codes with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part hereof as provided in Section 5 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
    The general index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of George R. Langford, President, and Robert D. Ussery, Vice President, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Fletcher Long, City Attorney, for his supervision, cooperation and interest during the progress of the work on this Code. 
    This Code is presented for the use and benefit of the citizens of the City of Forrest City, Arkansas.

Upon written application to the utility, if a customer can show by such an approved and inspected meter that an appreciable quantity of the water used by the customer did not reach the sewer system, then the computation upon which that customer's sewage charge is based shall be adjusted and determined in accordance with the measurement as indicated by the meter. The burden of showing that an appreciable quantity of water usage does not reach the sewer system shall be totally upon the customer and the utility must be satisfied that the location of the meter insures that an accurate accounting is obtained. In no event shall the customer be entitled to any adjustment for such water usage beyond three (3) months from the date of written application. 
EXTRA STRENGTH SURCHARGES

ARTICLE VI - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT - PUD
Section 1. General Description.
The purposes of this district are to provide a means for developing open space areas in larger
developments, to take advantage of natural features of the landscape in this design, to improve
the quality of urban environment and to reduce the costs of developing and providing public
resources and utilities. The owners of any tract ofland containing at least three (3) acres may
submit a plan for the use and development of the entire tract for residential, compatible business,
and related uses as a single and unified project. The basic control of the development intensity
shall be the requirements of one or more of the residential districts. The cluster development
concept may be used under the Planned Unit Development regulations. The Planned Unit
Development shall be a superimposed designation providing a broader latitude of design to
achieve the above stated goals. A permit is required.
Section 2. · Site Plan Required.
A detailed site plan of the proposed Planned Unit Development District shall be submitted to the
Site Plan Review Committee for study and approval; which shall.be considered as a
recommendation to the Forrest City Planning Commission. Final approval shall be made by the
City Council based on the recommendation of the Forrest City Planning Commission.
Section 3. Uses Permitted.
Uses permitted in the Planned Unit Development District are those normally necessary to make
up a total neighborhood, specifically including the following:
A. Residential Uses. Any use permitted in the R-3, Multi-Family Residential
District.
B. Business Uses. Permitted commercial uses shall be those of retail type and
personal service type businesses associated with community shopping centers and
office park development.
C. Public and Semi-Public Facilities. Community centers, schools, parks and other
recreational facilities, churches, clubs, publ ic utilities, libraries and other public
buildings and structures required to provide essential public services and any
other use which primarily serves the residents of such a development.
Section 4. Regulations.
A. Residential Lot Size. No minimum lot sizes are established, per se, so the
housing can be clustered or otherwise concentrated or arranged in planned
locations on the site to take advantage of its natural features.
45
B. Open Space Reservation. In any Planned Unit Development, the amount of land
not used by residential buildings, accessory structures, and yards but required by
the residential zoning of the site, shall be reserved collectively in contiguous units
accessible to all the building sites in the development as maintained open space
for the purpose of providing parks, recreational facilities, ways for pedestrian
movement and circulation, and conserving visually pleasing elements of the
environment. Prior to the sale of any lot, site, home or other structure a bond of
sufficient surety determined by the Land Development Code Administrator shall
be posted with the City for completion of said open space improvements prior to
such sale. The open space developed will constitute no less than an equivalent
proportional amount to the area being developed in the case of partial
development.
C. Development Density. Business uses in any Planned Unit Development District
shall not constitute over twenty-five (25) percent of the land area of such
development. Land area occupied by residential, business, public and other
buildings and accessory structures shall not exceed forty-five (45) percent of the
total land area of such development. Parking areas for business facilities are
considered a commercial use of land. Be it further provided that business
development may not be started until the residential development is at least onefourth
(1/4) complete.-
D. Development, the developer shall submit a set of covenants running with the land
providing for an automatic membership in the Homes Association, to be an
incorporated nonprofit organization, operating under recorded land agreements,
through which each property owner in the Planned Unit Development is
automatically subject to a charge for an appropriate proportionate share of the
expenses for maintaining the common property, open space and/or other activities
of the Association. Once established, the covenants shall continue and remain in
force during the entire existence of the Planned Unit Development.
E. Responsibility for Open Space. Nothing in this Section of the Code shall be
construed as a responsibility of the City of Forrest City, either for maintenance or
liability of the following, which shall include, but not be limited to, any private
open areas, parks, recreational facilities; and a hold harmless clause shall be
incorporated in the covenants running with the land to this effect. It shall be
provided further, however, that when an owner of a Planned Unit Development
desires to dedicate certain land areas to the City for public parks and recreational
facilities, and the City approves the nature and location of such lands, and accepts
the dedicated areas, the City shall be responsible for the operation and
maintenance of these lands and properties.
F. Common open spaces shall be provided within a planned unit development in
accordance with the Land Development Code of Forrest City, Arkansas. The
size, shape, dimension and location of the open spaces shall be determined by the
Site Plan Review Committee in conjunction with the developer or subdivider with
46
consideration being given to the size and extent of the proposed development and
the physical characteristics of the land being developed. Consideration should
also be given in providing parks, recreational facilities, both active and passive,
and pedestrian walkways.
1. Common open space shall be guaranteed by a restrictive covenant
describing the open space and its maintenance and improvement running
with the land for the benefit of the residents of the planned unit
development. The developer shall file, at the time the approved final plat
is filed, legal documents which will produce the aforesaid guarantees and,
in particular, will provide for restricting the use of common open spaces
for the designated purpose.
G. In order to minimize the disturbance of the natural environment, a general
landscaping plan shall be required at the time of preliminary plat submission
showing the spacing, sizes, and specific types oflandscaping material. The Site
Plan Review Committee shall review the landscaping plan in conjunction with the
review of the preliminary plat.
1. The preservation of the natural amenities within the planned unit
development shall be given due consideration which shall include
topography, trees, and ground cover, natural bodies of water, and other
significant natural features. Existing trees shall be preserved wherever
possible. The location of trees shall be considered when planning the
common open space, location of buildings, underground services, walks,
paved areas, playgrounds, parking areas, and finished grade levels. The
Site Plan .Review Committee shall inquire into the means whereby trees
and other natural features will be protected during construction. Excessive
site clearing of top soil, trees and natural features before the
commencement of building operations shall be discouraged by the Site
Plan Review Committee.
H. Transportation. The vehicular circulation system shall be designed so as to permit
smooth traffic flow with minimum hazards to pedestrian traffic. Minor streets
within planned unit development shall not be connected to streets outside the
development in such a way as to encourage their use by through traffic.
1. The pedestrian circulation system and its related walkways shall be
insulated as reasonably as possible from the vehicular movement. This
shall include, when deemed to be necessary by the Site Plan Review
Committee, pedestrian underpass or overpass in the vicinity of schools,
playgrounds, local shopping areas, and other neighborhood uses which
generate a considerable amount of pedestrian traffic.
I. Land Subdivision. In the construction and installation of all subdivision
improvements in the planned unit development, said improvements shall conform
47
to all requirements and standards as set forth in Article 6, unless exception to the
requirements is recommended by the Site Plan Review Committee.
1. If the owners in the future should request that the private streets be
changed to public streets, the owners do fully agree that, before the
acceptance of such streets by the City, the owners will bear full expense of
reconstruction or any other action necessary to make the streets fully
conform to the requirements applicable to public streets, prior to
dedication and acceptance. The owners also shall agree that these streets
shall be dedicated to public use without compensation to the owners.
J. City Council Approval. Planned Unit Development Districts and establishment of
zoning must be approved by the Forrest City City Council. However, the
development shall be in accordance with the approved site plan. Any
contemplated deviation from the approved site plan shall be reviewed by the Site
Plan Review Committee, may be reviewed by Forrest City Planning Commission
if the Site Plan Review Committee considers the changes to require Forrest City
Planning Commission consideration, and all recommendations shall be submitted
to the Forrest City Council for approval. The Forrest City Planning Commission
has the authority to require reasonable plan changes for the Planned Unit
Development as a prerequisite to approval.
48
ARTICLE VII - NON-CONFORMING USES
Section 1. Non-conforming Use of Land.
In a residential district where open land is being used as a non-conforming use, and such use is
the principal use and not accessory to the main use conducted in a building, such nonconforming
use shall not be extended, enlarged or changed to another non-conforming use, either
on the same or adjoining property. Such non-conforming use of open land shall specifically
include billboards, poster boards, automobile wrecking yards, scrap iron and junk storage,
auction yards, c·ontractors' yards, stock yards, golf driving ranges and miniature golf courses and
. trailer camps or parks. If the non-conforming use of such open land ceases for a continuous
period of one year, then said property shall not again be used except in conformity with the
regulations of the district in which such open land is located.
Section 2. Non-Conforming Use of Buildings.
The lawful use of a building existing at the effective date of this code may be continued
although such use does not conform to the provisions hereof: If no structural alterations are
made, a non-conforming use of a building may be changed to another non-conforming use of the
same or of a more restricted classification. Whenever a non-conforming use has been changed to
a more restricted use or to a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a less
restricted use. The non-conforming use of a building may be hereafter extended throughout
those parts of a building which were lawfully and manifestly arranged or designed for such use at
the time of the enactment of this code.
Section 3. Discontinuance of Non-Conforming Uses.
No building or portion thereof used in whole or in part for a non-conforming use in a residential
district which remains idle or unused for a continuous period of one year, whether or not the
equipment or fixtures are removed, shall again be used except in conformity with the regulations
of the district in which such building or land is located.
Section 4. Repairs and Alterations to Non-Conforming Uses.
Repairs and alterations may be made to a non-conforming building provided that no extensions
shall be made unless the building is changed to a conforming use; provided, however, the Board
of Zoning Adjustment by special permit in the case of evident hardship may grant an extension
of non-conforming use not exceeding 25 per cent of the ground area of the building.
Section 5. Rebuilding of a Non-Conforming Use.
Nothing in this section shall prevent, within a period of six (6) months from the date of the
damage, the securing of a permit for the restoration of a non-conforming building damaged by
fire, explosion, act of God, or act of the public enemy. Any building restored under the
provisions of this section shall not be enlarged in exterior dimensions or increased in height.
49
Section 6. Intermittent Use.
The casual, intermittent, temporary, or illegal use of land or building shall not be sufficient to
establish the existence of a non-conforming use and the existence of a non-conforming use on
the part of a lot or tract shall not be construed to establish a non-conforming use on the entire lot
or tract.
Section 7. Existence of a Non-Conforming Use.
Whether a non-conforming use exists shall be a question of fact and shall be decided by the
. Board of Adjustment after public notice and in accordance with the rules of the Board.
50
