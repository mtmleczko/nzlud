other thing of value is to be furnished to the town for a valuable consideration to be paid by the town or is to be sold or transferred by the town,
provided the amount involved is more than one hundred dollars ($100.00). The term "contract" shall include any subcontract thereof.
EMPLOYEE: Any person holding a paid position of employment with the town, whether full time, part time, regular, temporary, or by contract.
INTEREST: A pecuniary, property, or commercial interest or any other interest, the primary significance of which is economic gain or the avoidance
of economic loss. An "interest" exists with regard to real property which is owned, leased, or used by an officer, commission member, or employee
if it is reasonably foreseeable that an action of the officer, commission member, or employee will have a special economic effect on the value or
use of the real property, distinguishable from its effect on the public. An officer, commission member or employee shall be deemed to have a
pecuniary interest in a contract if the officer, commission member or employee or any member of the officer's, commission member's or
employee's family is an employee, partner, officer, director or sales representative of the person with whom such contract is made. However, the
term "interest" shall not include any matter involving the common public good or necessity. Nor shall the term include any matter in which a similar
benefit is conferred to all persons or property similarly situated. Provided further, ownership individually or in a fiduciary capacity of any securities
or of any beneficial interest in securities of a business entity shall not be deemed to create an "interest" in the business entity unless the aggregate
amount of such securities, or interest in such securities, amounts to five percent (5%) or more of any class of the securities of the business entity
then outstanding or constitutes controlling interest in the business entity.
OFFICER: Each board member, each municipal judge, the town administrator, the town attorney, the water attorney, the prosecuting attorney, the
public works director, and the community development director.

partnership, association, or other legal entity.

2-1-4: INVESTMENT POLICY:
A. Governing Authority: All investments for the town shall be made in accordance with the Colorado Revised Statutes including: Colorado Revised
Statutes section 11-10.5-101 et seq., public deposit protection act; Colorado Revised Statutes section 11-47-101 et seq., savings and loan
association public deposit protection act; Colorado Revised Statutes section 15-1-304 et seq., prudent investor rule; Colorado Revised Statutes
section 24-75-601 et seq., legal investments for governmental units; Colorado Revised Statutes section 24-75-603, depositories; and Colorado
Revised Statutes section 24-75-701 et seq., local government pooling. Any revisions or extensions of these sections of the Colorado Revised
Statutes will be assumed to be part of this investment policy immediately upon enactment.
B. Scope:
1. Generally: This policy applies to the investment of all funds, excluding the investment of employees' retirement funds. Proceeds from bond
issues shall be covered by a separate policy.
2. Pooling Of Funds: Except for cash in certain restricted and special funds, the town of Erie will consolidate cash and reserve balances from all
funds to maximize investment earnings and to increase efficiencies with regard to investment pricing, safekeeping, and administration.
Investment income will be allocated to the various funds based on their respective participation and in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.
C. General Objectives: The primary objectives, in priority order, of investment activities shall be legality, safety, liquidity, and yield:
1. Safety: Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to
ensure the conservation of capital in the overall portfolio. The objective will be to moderate credit risk, interest rate risk and counterparty risk
associated with the investment of public funds.
a. Credit Risk: The town of Erie will manage credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to the failure of the security issuer or backer, by:
(1) Limiting investments to the types of securities listed in subsection G of this section.
(2) Diversifying the investment portfolio so that the impact of potential losses from any one type of security or from any one individual
issuer will be minimized.
b. Interest Rate Risk: The town of Erie will minimize interest rate risk, which is the risk that the market value of securities in the portfolio will
fall due to changes in market interest rates, by:
(1) Structuring the investment portfolio so that securities mature to meet cash requirements for ongoing operations, thereby avoiding the
need to sell securities on the open market prior to maturity.
(2) Investing operating funds primarily in shorter term securities, money market mutual funds, or similar investment pools and limiting the
average maturity of the portfolio in accordance with this policy (see subsection H of this section).
c. Counterparty Risk: The town will manage other forms of risk such as counterparty, which is the risk resulting from engaging in transactions
with other parties, by prequalifying the financial institutions, broker/dealers, intermediaries, and advisers with which the town of Erie will do
business in accordance with subsection E of this section.
2. Liquidity: The investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid to meet all operating requirements that may be reasonably anticipated. This
is accomplished by structuring the portfolio so that securities mature concurrent with cash needs to meet anticipated demands (static
liquidity). Furthermore, since not all possible cash demands can be anticipated, the portfolio should consist largely of securities with active
secondary or resale markets (dynamic liquidity). Alternatively, a portion of the portfolio shall be placed in money market mutual funds,
demand deposit accounts, overnight repurchase agreements, overnight commercial paper and other allowable securities, or local
government investment pools, which offer same or next day liquidity for short term funds.
3. Yield: The investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout budgetary and economic
cycles, taking into account the investment risk constraints and liquidity needs. Return on investment is of secondary importance compared to
the safety and liquidity objectives described above. The core of investments are limited to relatively low risk securities in anticipation of
earning a fair return relative to the risk being assumed. Securities shall generally be held until maturity with the following exceptions:
a. A security with declining credit may be sold early to minimize loss of principal.
b. A security swap would improve the quality, yield, or target duration in the portfolio.
c. Liquidity needs of the portfolio require that the security be sold.
D. Standards Of Care:
1. Prudence:
a. The standard of prudence to be used for managing the town's assets shall be Colorado Revised Statutes section 15-1-304 which states:
In acquiring, investing, reinvesting, exchanging, retaining, selling, and managing the funds and investments for the benefit of the Town,
fiduciaries shall be required to have in mind the responsibilities which are attached to such offices and the size, nature, and needs of the
funds and investments entrusted to their care and shall exercise the judgment and care, under the circumstances then prevailing, which
persons of prudence, discretion, and intelligence exercise in the management of the funds and investments of another, not in regard to
speculation but in regard to the permanent disposition of funds, considering the probable income as well as the probable safety of capital.
10/28/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 32/449
b. Within the limitations of the foregoing standards, fiduciaries may acquire and retain funds and investments as authorized by the town in
this investment policy, which persons of prudence, discretion, and intelligence would acquire or retain for the account of another.
c. Investment staff acting in accordance with written procedures, the investment policy, and exercising due diligence shall be relieved of
personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk or market price changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported in
a timely fashion to the town administrator and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments.
2. Ethics And Conflicts Of Interest: Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity
that could conflict with the proper execution and management of the investment program, or that could impair their ability to make impartial
decisions. Employees and investment officials shall disclose any material interests in financial institutions with which they conduct
business. They shall further disclose any personal financial/investment positions that could be related to the performance of the investment
portfolio. Employees and officers shall refrain from undertaking personal investment transactions with the same individual with whom
business is conducted on behalf of the town of Erie.
3. Delegation Of Authority: Authority to manage the investment program is granted to the finance director, hereinafter referred to as "investment
officer". Responsibility for the operation of the investment program is hereby delegated to the investment officer, who shall act in accordance
with established written procedures and internal controls for the operation of the investment program consistent with this investment policy.
Procedures should include references to: safekeeping, delivery versus payment, investment accounting, repurchase agreements, wire
transfer agreements, and collateral/depository agreements. No person may engage in an investment transaction except as provided under
the terms of this policy and the procedures established by the investment officer. The investment officer shall be responsible for all
transactions undertaken and shall establish a system of controls to regulate the activities of subordinate officials.
E. Authorized Financial Institutions, Depositories, And Broker/Dealers:
1. A list will be maintained of financial institutions and depositories authorized to provide investment services. In addition, a list will be
maintained of approved security broker/dealers selected by creditworthiness (e.g., a minimum capital requirement of $10,000,000.00 and at
least 5 years of operation). These may include "primary" dealers or regional dealers that qualify under securities and exchange commission
(SEC) rule 15C3-1 (uniform net capital rule).
2. All financial institutions and broker/dealers who desire to become qualified for investment transactions must supply the following as
appropriate:

e. Evidence of adequate insurance coverage.
3. An annual review of the financial condition and registration of all qualified financial institutions and broker/dealers will be conducted by the

F. Safekeeping And Custody:
1. Delivery Versus Payment: All trades of marketable securities will be executed by delivery vs. payment (DVP) to ensure that securities are
deposited in an eligible financial institution prior to the release of funds.
2. Trust Custody: Securities shall be held by a centralized independent third party custodian trustee selected by the entity as evidenced by
perfected interest in the securities in the town of Erie's name.
3. Internal Controls:
a. The investment officer is responsible for establishing and maintaining an internal control structure designed to ensure that the assets of
the town of Erie are protected from loss, theft or misuse. Details of the internal controls system shall be documented in an investment
procedures manual and shall be reviewed and updated annually. The internal control structure shall be designed to provide reasonable
assurance that these objectives are met. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes that: 1) the cost of a control should not exceed
the benefits likely to be derived; and 2) the valuation of costs and benefits requires estimates and judgments by management.
b. The internal controls structure shall address the following points:
(1) Control of collusion.
(2) Separation of transaction authority from accounting and record keeping.
(3) Trust custody.
(4) Avoidance of physical delivery securities.
(5) Clear delegation of authority to subordinate staff members.
(6) Written confirmation of transactions for investments and wire transfers.
(7) Dual authorizations of wire transfers.
(8) Development of a wire transfer agreement with the lead bank and third party custodian.

C. To ensure that new land development is reasonably benefited by the provision of the capital improvements provided with the proceeds of impact
fees.
D. To ensure that all applicable legal standards and criteria are properly incorporated in these procedures.
E. To ensure that all applicable procedures and requirements of Colorado Revised Statutes sections 29-1-801 through 29-1-804 and 29-20-101
through 29-20-108 have been met.
F. The impact fee study, prepared by TischlerBise, dated October 4, 2016, set forth a reasonable methodology and analysis for determining and
quantifying the reasonable impacts of various types of proposed residential and nonresidential development on the Town's capital facilities and
streets system; quantified the reasonable impact of proposed development on the capital facilities addressed therein; determined the costs
necessary to meet the demands created by new development; and determined impact fees as set forth in article A of this chapter that are at a
level no greater than necessary to defray such impacts of proposed new development on the Town's existing capital facilities. The Town hereby
establishes as Town standards the assumptions and level of service standards referenced in the impact fee study as part of its current plans for
future expansions to the Town's capital facilities addressed in such study.
G. The impact fees set forth in this chapter are based on the impact fee study and are intended to defray the projected impacts on the Town's park
capital facilities, storm drainage systems, public capital facilities and streets and related appurtenances directly related to and caused by
proposed development.
H. The impact fees set forth in this chapter are based on the impact fee study and do not and will not be used to remedy any deficiencies in capital
facilities or improvements that exist without regard to the proposed development. (Ord. 25-2017, 10-10-2017, eff. 1-1-2018)

2-5-8: IMPOSITION, CALCULATION AND COLLECTION PROCEDURES:
A. Generally: An applicant may request notification by the Town of the applicable impact fee requirements at the time of application for a building
permit. At such time, an impact fee calculation form shall be prepared and a copy shall be given to the applicant. Impact fees shall be
calculated by the Town at the time of application for a building permit and shall be paid by the applicant prior to the issuance of a building
permit.
B. Calculation:
1. Upon receipt of an application for a building permit or an application for a business license, the Town shall determine: a) whether it is a
residential or nonresidential use; b) the specific category (type) of residential or nonresidential development, if applicable; c) if residential, the
number of new dwelling units; and d) if nonresidential, the number of new or additional square feet of gross floor area (rounded up to the
nearest square foot) and the proposed use.
2. Upon receipt of an application for a building permit, the Town shall determine whether it is for a change in use. In such cases, the impact fee
due shall be based only on the incremental increase in the fee for the additional service units added by the change in use.
3. After making these determinations, the Town shall calculate the demand for the capital improvements (service units) added by the new land
development for each capital improvements category for which an impact fee is being imposed and calculate the applicable impact fee by
multiplying the demand (service units) added by the new development by the amount of the applicable impact fee per service unit,
incorporating any applicable offset if set forth in the particular impact fee calculation methodology.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 41/449
4. If the type of land use proposed for land development is not expressly listed in the particular impact fee ordinance and schedule, the Town
shall:
a. Identify the most similar land use type listed and calculate the impact fee based on that land use; or
b. Identify the broader land use category within which the specified land use would fit and calculate the impact fee based on that land use
category; or
c. At the option of the applicant, or the Director, determine the basis used to calculate the fee pursuant to an independent impact analysis of
service units added. This option shall be available only for transportation impact fees and shall be requested by the applicant on a form
provided by the Town for such purpose. If this option is chosen, the following shall apply:
(1) The applicant shall be responsible, at its sole expense, for preparing the independent impact analysis, which shall be reviewed for
approval by the Director and, if appropriate, the Director of Streets and Utilities or other Town staff or officials, prior to payment of the
fee.
(2) The independent impact analysis shall measure the impact (in service units) that the proposed development will have on the particular
category of capital improvements at issue, and shall be based on the same methodologies used in the impact fee calculation
methodology report, and shall be supported by professionally acceptable data and assumptions.
(3) After review of the independent impact analysis submitted by the applicant, the Director shall accept or reject the analysis and provide
written notice to the applicant of his decision on a form provided for such purpose within thirty (30) days. If the independent impact
analysis is rejected, the written notice shall provide an explanation of the insufficiencies of the analysis.
(4) The final decision of the Director may be appealed pursuant to section 2-5-10 of this chapter.
5. An applicant may request a nonbinding estimate of impact fees due for a particular land development at any time by filing a request on a
form provided for such purpose by the Town; provided, however, that such estimate may be subject to change when a formal application for a
building permit for land development is made. Such nonbinding estimate is solely for the benefit of the prospective applicant and shall in no
way bind the Town nor preclude it from making amendments or revisions to any provisions of this chapter, the specific impact fee
implementing ordinances or the impact fee schedules.
6. The calculation of impact fees due from a multiple use land development shall be based upon the aggregated demand (in service units) for
each category of capital improvements generated by each land use type in the land development.
7. The calculation of impact fees due from a phased land development shall be based upon the demand (in service units) generated by each
specific land use within the phase of development for which a separate building permit is requested.
8. Impact fees shall be calculated based on the impact fee amount in effect at the time of a complete application for a building permit. An
application shall be complete as determined by the Town of Erie.
C. Offsets And Credits:
1. Not Required To Meet Same Need; Award Restrictions: No party shall be required to provide any site specific dedication or improvement to
meet the same need for capital facilities for which an impact fee is imposed. Therefore, after the effective date hereof, all land dedications
and improvements for a capital need for which an impact fee is imposed, over and above those required by the Town in connection with a
proposed development, shall result in a credit against the impact fee otherwise due for such development. However, no credit shall be
awarded for: a) any land dedications for or acquisition or construction of site related or site specific improvements; b) any land dedications
not accepted by the Town; c) any acquisition or construction of facilities and improvements not approved in writing by the Town prior to
commencement of the acquisition, development or construction; d) any dedication, construction or acquisition of a type of facility or
improvement not included in the calculation of the applicable capital facilities impact fee in the impact fee study.
2. Examples Of Offsets: Offsets against the amount of an impact fee due from a land development shall be provided for, among other things,
contributions made or to be made in the future in cash, or by dedication of land or by actual construction of all or part of a capital
improvement by the affected property owner for capital improvements meeting or exceeding the demand generated by the land development
and the contribution is determined by the Town to be an acceptable substitute for the cost of capital improvements which are included in the
particular impact fee calculation methodology.
3. Valuation Of Credits: The credit due to an applicant shall be calculated and documented as follows:
a. Credit for qualifying land dedications shall, at the applicant's option, be valued at: 1) one hundred percent (100%) of the most recent
estimated actual value for such land as shown in the records of the County Assessor, or 2) that fair market value established by an MAI or
Colorado certified general real estate appraiser acceptable to the Town in an appraisal paid for by the applicant.
b. In order to receive credit for qualifying acquisition or construction of capital facility improvements, the applicant shall submit completed
engineering drawings, specifications and construction cost estimates to the Town. The Town shall determine the amount of credit due
based on the information submitted or, if it determines that such information is inaccurate or unreliable, then on alternative engineering or
construction costs acceptable to the Town.
4. Effective Date Of Credits:
a. Approved credits for land dedications shall become effective when the land has been conveyed to the Town in a form acceptable to the
Town at no cost to the Town, and accepted by the Town. When such conditions have been met, the Town shall note that fact in its records.
Upon written request from the applicant, the Town shall issue a letter stating the amount of credit available.
b. Approved credits for the acquisition or construction of capital facilities and improvements shall generally become effective when: 1) all
required construction has been completed and has been accepted by the Town; 2) a suitable maintenance and warranty bond has been
10/28/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 42/449
received and approved by the Town; and 3) all design, construction, inspection, testing, bonding and acceptance procedures have been
completed in compliance with all applicable Town and State procedures.
c. Approved credits may be used to reduce the amount of impact fees due from any proposed development until the amount of the credit is
exhausted. A credit may only be applied to the same category of impact fee for which the credit was obtained. Each time a request to use
approved credits is presented to the Town, the Town shall reduce the amount of the applicable impact fee otherwise due from the applicant
and shall note in the Town records the amount of credit remaining, if any. Upon request of the applicant, the Town shall send the applicant
a letter stating the number of credits available.
d. Approved credits shall only be used to reduce the amount of the impact fee otherwise due under this chapter and shall not be paid to the
applicant in cash or in credits against any other monies due from the applicant to the Town. If the credit has not been exhausted within ten
(10) years of the date of issuance of the first building permit for which a fee was due and payable under the provisions of this chapter, or
within such other period as may be designated in writing by the Town, such credit shall lapse.
5. Transferability Of Credits: Credits for contributions, construction or dedication of land shall be transferable within the same development and
for the same capital facility for which the credit is provided, but shall not be transferable outside the development or used as credit against
fees for other capital facilities. Credit may be transferred pursuant to these terms and conditions by any written instrument that clearly
identifies which credits issued under this chapter are to be transferred. The instrument shall be signed by both the transferor and transferee,
and the document shall be delivered to the Town Planning Director or designee for registration of the change in ownership. If there are
outstanding obligations under such agreement, the Town may require that the transferor or transferee, or both (as appropriate) enter into an
amendment to the credit agreement to assure the performance of such obligations.
6. Contributions Or Payments: Contributions for capital facilities shall be based on the value of the contribution or payment at the time it is
made to the Town.
7. Determination: The amount of the excess contribution, if any, shall be determined by the Town upon receipt of an application form requesting
an offset; provided, however, that: a) the Town will make no reimbursement for excess contributions unless and until the particular impact fee
fund has sufficient revenue to make the reimbursement without jeopardizing the continuity of the Town's Capital Improvements Program; and
b) the excess contribution may not be transferred or credited to any other type of impact fees calculated to be due from that development for
other types of capital improvements. The determination of the eligibility for and the amount of the credit shall be made by the Town on a form
provided for such purposes. The discretion of the Town shall not be abused. If the applicant contends that any aspect of the Town's decision
constitutes an abuse of discretion, the applicant shall be entitled to appeal pursuant to section 2-5-10 of this chapter.
8. Preapproval Of Town: No offset or credit shall be allowed unless the Town has approved the contribution or payment before it is made.
D. Collection:
1. The Town shall collect all applicable impact fees at the time of issuance of a building permit and shall issue a receipt to the applicant for such
payment unless:
a. The applicant is determined to be entitled to a full offset or credit; or
b. The applicant has been determined to be not subject to the payment of an impact fee; or
c. The applicant has filed an appeal, and a bond or other surety in the amount of the impact fee, as calculated by the Town and approved by
the Town Attorney and Finance Director, has been posted with the Town.
2. The Town shall collect an impact fee at the time of issuance of a building permit even if impact fees were paid by the applicant at an earlier
time in the development permit or approval process if the amount of the impact fees have increased since such prior approval. Except as
provided for in subsection 2-5-4A of this chapter, the applicant shall only be liable for the difference between the impact fees paid earlier and
those in effect at the time of issuance of the subsequent building permit. (Ord. 25-2017, 10-10-2017, eff. 1-1-2018)
2-5-9: ACCOUNTING, APPROPRIATIONS AND REFUNDS:
A. Impact Fee Accounting: An impact fee fund shall be established by the Town for each category of capital improvements for which impact fees
are imposed. All impact fees collected by the Town shall be deposited into the appropriate impact fee fund and shall be invested in interest
bearing instruments. All interest earned on monies deposited to such fund shall be credited to and shall be considered resources of the fund.
The Town shall establish and implement necessary accounting controls to ensure that impact fee monies are properly deposited, accounted for
and appropriated in accordance with this chapter and any other applicable legal requirements.

contracts, bonds, notes or other obligations issued by or on behalf of the Town or other applicable local governmental entities to finance such
capital improvements. All appropriations from impact fee funds shall be detailed on a form provided for such purposes and filed within the
Finance Department.
2. Restrictions On Appropriations: Impact fees shall be appropriated only: a) for the particular category of capital improvements for which they
were imposed, calculated and collected; and b) within six (6) years of the beginning of the fiscal year immediately succeeding the date of

capital improvements nor for operational or personnel expenses associated with the provision of the capital improvements.
3. Appropriation Of Impact Fees Beyond Six Years Of Collection: Notwithstanding subsection B2 of this section, impact fees may be
appropriated beyond six (6) years from the beginning of the fiscal year immediately succeeding the date of collection if the appropriation is
for a capital improvement which requires more than six (6) years to plan, design and construct, and the demand for the capital improvement

is generated in whole or in part by the new land development, or if the capital improvement will actually serve the new land development.
Such appropriations shall be fully documented on forms provided by the Town for such purposes.
C. Procedure For Appropriation Of Impact Fees:
1. The Town shall each year identify capital improvement projects anticipated to be funded in whole or in part with impact fees. The capital
improvement recommendations shall be based upon the impact fee annual review set forth in section 2-5-7 of this chapter and such other
information as may be relevant, and may be part of the Town's annual budget and capital improvements programming process.

requirements and any guidelines adopted by the Board of Trustees.
3. The Board of Trustees may include impact fee funded capital improvements in the Town's annual budget and Capital Improvements
Program. If included, the description of the capital improvement shall specify the nature, location, capacity to be added, service area,
need/demand for, and the anticipated timing of completion of the capital improvement.
4. The Board of Trustees may authorize impact fee funded capital improvements at such other times as may be deemed necessary and
appropriate by the Board of Trustees.

4. For failure to provide, in a continuing manner, the types of services proposed in the accepted application, unless the board of trustees
specifically approves the grantee a delay or change or the grantee has obtained modification of its obligation under section 625 of the cable
communications policy act of 1984, the grantee shall pay to the town one hundred dollars ($100.00) per day for each day, or part thereof, that
each noncompliance continues.
5. For any other action or nonaction by the grantee, as agreed upon between the town and grantee, and set forth in the franchise agreement.
Nothing in this section shall preclude further liquidated damages as agreed upon by parties in the franchise agreement.
B. If the town concludes that a grantee is liable for liquidated damages pursuant to this section, it shall issue to grantee by certified mail a notice of
intention to assess liquidated damages. The notice shall set forth the basis for the assessment and shall inform the grantee that liquidated
damages will be assessed from the date of the notice, unless the assessment notice is appealed for hearing before the board of trustees, and
the board of trustees rules: 1) that the violation has been corrected; or 2) that an extension of time or other relief should be granted. A grantee
desiring a hearing before the board of trustees shall send a written notice of appeal by certified mail to the town within ten (10) days of the date
on which the town sent the notice of intention to assess liquidated damages. The hearing on the grantee's appeal shall be within thirty (30)
days of the date on which the town sent the notice of intention to assess liquidated damages. Unless the board of trustees indicates to the
contrary, said liquidated damages shall be assessed beginning with the date on which the town sent the notice of the intention to assess
liquidated damages and continuing thereafter until such time as the violation ceases, as determined by the town. (Ord. 386, 5-25-1989)
2-8C-25: COMPLIANCE REQUIRED WHEN NO ENFORCEMENT:
A grantee shall not be relieved of any obligation to comply with any of the provisions of the franchise or any rule, regulation, requirement or
directive promulgated thereunder by reason of any failure of the town or its officers, agents or employees to enforce prompt compliance. (Ord. 386,
5-25-1989)
2-8C-26: TERMINATION OF FRANCHISE; REMOVAL OF EQUIPMENT:
A. Upon expiration or termination of a franchise, if the franchise is not renewed and if neither the town nor an assignee purchases the cable
television system, the grantee may remove any underground cable from the streets which has been installed in such a manner that it can be
removed without trenching or other opening of the streets along the extension of cable to be removed. The grantee shall not remove any
underground cable or conduit which requires trenching or other opening of the streets along the extension of cable to be removed, except as
hereinafter provided. The grantee shall remove, at its sole cost and expense, any underground cable or conduit by trenching or opening of the
streets along the extension thereof or otherwise which is ordered to be removed by the board of trustees based upon a determination, in the
sole discretion of the board of trustees, that removal is required in order to eliminate or prevent a hazardous condition or promote future
utilization of the streets for public purposes. Any order by the board of trustees to remove cable or conduit shall be mailed to the grantee not
later than thirty (30) calendar days following the date of expiration of the franchise. A grantee shall file written notice with the town clerk not
later than thirty (30) calendar days following the date of expiration or termination of the franchise of its intention to remove cable and a schedule
for removal by location. The schedule and timing of removal shall be subject to approval and regulation by the director of public works of the
town. Removal shall be completed not later than twelve (12) months following the date of expiration of the franchise. Underground cable and
conduit in the streets which is not removed shall be deemed abandoned, and title thereto shall be vested in the town.
B. Upon expiration or termination of a franchise, if the franchise is not renewed and if neither the town nor an assignee purchases the system, the
grantee, at its sole expense, shall, unless relieved of the obligation by the town, remove from the streets all aboveground elements of the cable
television system, including, but not limited to, amplifier boxes, pedestal mounted terminal boxes, and cable attached to or suspended from
poles which are not purchased by the town or its assignee.
C. The grantee shall apply for and obtain such encroachment permits, licenses, authorizations or other approvals and pay such fees and deposit
such security as required by applicable ordinance of the town, shall conduct and complete the work of removal in compliance with all such
applicable ordinances, and shall restore the streets to the same condition they were in before the work of removal commenced. The work of
removal shall be completed not later than one year following the date of expiration of the franchise. (Ord. 386, 5-25-1989)

Storm drainage fee:
Rate per single-family residential equivalent (SFRE)* $5.41 $6.60 $8.05 $9.82 $11.98
* Storm drainage fees are assessed based on the impervious area of the property. The average impervious square footage of a singlefamily
residence in the Town is approximately 5,300 square feet, defined as a single-family residential equivalent (SFRE). All residential
customers will be charged on the assumption that their property is equal to 1 SFRE. Commercial customers will be charged based on the
impervious square footage divided by 5,300 square feet. For example, for a commercial property with 25,000 impervious square feet, the
monthly storm drainage fee would be $25.52 in 2015 (25,000 impervious square feet divided by 5,300 square feet equals 4.72 SFREs.
4.72 SFREs multiplied by $5.41 = $25.52).
Note: Irrigation customers are not assessed a storm drainage fee.

Note: All gallon usage is based on water usage and is calculated by rounding to the nearest 1,000 gallons.
* Average winter wastewater usage will be used during the following 12 months to calculate the volume charge. For example, average
usage for December 2014, January 2015 and February 2015 will be used as the basis for the volume charge for the period March 2015
10/28/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 69/449
through February 2016.
For commercial accounts, if internal water usage patterns for the months of December - February are not representative of internal
usage throughout the year, the monthly wastewater volume charge will be based on each month's water usage. The appropriate basis for
commercial wastewater charges for each account will be established by the Town at the inception of each account, and is subject to
adjustment if usage patterns change.
The effective date for the rate increase shall be the first day of the calendar year.

Colorado Revised Statutes article 26 of title 39, and by rules and regulations promulgated by the department of revenue.
F. Vendor's Fees: All vendors shall be entitled as collection agent for the town to withhold an amount equal to three and one-third percent (31/3%)

liability. Any person who is required to be licensed pursuant to town ordinance, who has failed to obtain such license shall provide, upon
request by the director of finance, books and records dating back to the time such person began engaging in business in the town.

requirements of the subpoena, power to make such order as, in the judge's discretion, the judge deems consistent with the law for
punishment of contempt.
d. Subpoena To Secure Evidence: If the director of finance is unable to secure from the taxpayer information relating to the correctness of the
taxpayer's return or the amount of the income of the taxpayer, the director of finance may apply to any judge of a district court of the state
for the issuance of subpoenas to such other persons as the director of finance believes may have knowledge in the premises, and upon
making a showing satisfactory to the court that the taxpayer cannot be found or evades service of subpoena or fails or refuses to produce
records or give testimony, the judge shall have power to cause the issuance of subpoenas under the seal of the court to the person sought
to be so summoned requiring them or any of them to appear before the director of finance and give testimony relating to the taxpayer's
return or income. In case any of such persons so served with subpoena shall fail to respond thereto, the judge may proceed against such

notice setting forth the name of the taxpayer, the amount of the use tax owed, the date of the accrual thereof, and that the town claims a first
and prior lien therefor on the real and personal property of the taxpayer, except as to preexisting liens of a bona fide mortgagee, pledgee,
judgment creditor or purchaser, which right has attached prior to the filing of the notice as hereinafter provided. The notice shall be on forms
prepared by the town director of finance, and when filed in the office of the clerk and recorder of any county in this state in which the taxpayer
owns real or personal property, such notice shall create a lien as aforesaid on such property in that county and constitute a notice thereof.

unpaid until such time as the former owner shall produce a receipt from the director of finance showing that the taxes have been paid or a
certificate that no taxes are due.
b. Purchases Subject To Lien: If the purchaser of a business or stock or goods shall fail to withhold the purchase money as provided in
subsection G2a of this section and the taxes shall be due and unpaid after the ten (10) day period allowed, the purchaser, as well as the

sale or otherwise, takes such subject to the lien for any delinquent sales taxes owed by such person and shall be liable for the payment of
all delinquent sales taxes of such prior owner, not, however, exceeding the value of the property so taken or acquired.
3. Status Of Unpaid Tax In Bankruptcy And Receivership: Whenever the business or property of any taxpayer subject to this section shall be
placed in receivership, bankruptcy or assignment for the benefit of creditors or seized under distraint for property taxes, all taxes, penalties
and interest imposed by this section and for which such retailer is in any way liable under the terms of this section shall be a prior and
preferred lien against all the property of such taxpayer, except as to preexisting claims or liens of a bona fide mortgagee, pledgee, judgment
creditor or purchaser whose rights shall have attached prior to the filing of the notice as provided herein on the property of the taxpayer other
than on the goods, stock in trade and business fixtures of such taxpayer. No law enforcement officer, receiver, assignee or other officer shall

liens for general taxes created by state law and except as to preexisting claims or liens of a bona fide mortgagee, pledgee, judgment
creditor, or purchaser whose rights shall have attached prior to the filing of the notice of tax lien on the property of the taxpayer other than

the taxpayer by certified mail, setting forth the name of the taxpayer, the amount of the tax, penalties and interest, the date of the accrual
thereof and that the town claims a first and prior lien therefor on the real and tangible personal property of the taxpayer except as to
preexisting claims or liens of a bona fide mortgagee, pledgee, judgment creditor, or purchaser whose rights shall have attached prior to the
filing of the notice as provided in this subsection on property of the taxpayer other than on the goods, stock in trade and business fixtures of
such taxpayer.

discretion, the director of finance may declare the taxable period immediately terminated, determine the tax and issue notice and demand
for payment thereof, and having done so, the tax shall be due and payable forthwith, and the director of finance may proceed immediately
to collect such tax as provided herein.
b. Immediate Enforcement Action: In any other case wherein it appears that the revenue is in jeopardy, the director of finance may
immediately issue demand for payment; and, regardless of the provisions set forth herein, the tax shall be due and payable forthwith and,
in the director of finance's discretion, the director of finance may proceed immediately to collect the tax as provided herein.
c. Security For Payment: Collection under either subsection G8a or G8b of this section may be stayed if the taxpayer gives such security for
payment as shall be satisfactory to the director of finance.
9. Methods Of Enforcing Collection:
a. Issuance Of Distraint: The director of finance may issue a warrant under the director of finance's own hand directed to any employee,
agent or representative of the finance department, sometimes referred to collectively in this subsection as "agent" or "revenue collector", or
to any law enforcement officer of any county of the state, commanding such person to distrain, seize and sell the personal property of the
taxpayer, except such personal property as is exempt from execution and sale by any statute of this state, for the payment of the tax due
together with penalties and interest accrued thereon and cost of execution:
(1) When any deficiency in tax is not paid within twenty (20) days from the mailing of notice of final determination, assessment and
demand for payment therefor and no hearing has been requested and no appeal from such deficiency assessment has been docketed
with any district court of this state within such period;
(2) When any other amount of tax, penalty or interest is not paid within twenty (20) days from the mailing of assessment and demand for
payment thereof; or
(3) Immediately upon making of a jeopardy assessment or of the issuance of a demand for payment as provided in subsection G8 of this
section.
b. Distraint Seizure; Advertisement Of Sale: The agent charged with the collection shall make or cause to be made an account of the goods
or effects distrained, a copy of which, signed by the agent making such distraint, shall be left with the owner or possessor or at the owner's
or possessor's usual place of abode with some member of the owner's or possessor's family over the age of eighteen (18) years or at the
owner's or possessor's usual place of business with the owner's or possessor's stenographer, bookkeeper or chief clerk or, if the taxpayer
is a corporation, shall be left with any officer, manager, general agent or agent for process, with a note of the sum demanded and the time
and place of sale; and shall forthwith cause to be published a notice of the time and place of sale, together with a description of the
property to be sold in a legal newspaper within the county wherein distraint is made, or, in lieu thereof and in the discretion of the director
of finance, the agent or law enforcement officer shall cause such notice to be publicly posted at the courthouse of the county wherein such
distraint is made, and copies thereof to be posted in at least two (2) other public places within such county. The time fixed for the sale shall
not be less than ten (10) days nor more than sixty (60) days from the date of such notification to the owner or possessor of the property
and the publication or posting of such notices. The sale may be adjourned from time to time by such agent or law enforcement officer if it is
deemed advisable, but not for a time to exceed a total of ninety (90) days from the date first fixed for the sale. When any personal property
is advertised for sale under distraint, the agent or law enforcement officer making the seizure shall proceed to sell such property at public
auction, offering the property at not less than a fair minimum price, including the expenses of making the seizure and of advertising the
sale, and if the amount bid for the property at the sale is not equal to the fair minimum price so fixed, the agent or law enforcement officer
conducting the sale may declare such to be purchased by such agent or law enforcement officer for the town. The property so purchased
may be sold by the agent or the law enforcement officer under such regulations as may be prescribed by the director of finance. In any
case of distraint for the payment of taxes, the goods, chattels or effects so distrained shall be restored to the owner or possessor if, prior to
the sale, the amount due is paid, together with the fees and other charges or may be redeemed by any person holding evidence
satisfactory to the director of finance of right of possession.
c. Certificate Of Sale; Evidence Of Purchase: In all cases of sale, the agent or law enforcement officer making the sale shall issue a
certificate of sale to each purchaser, and such certificate shall be prima facie evidence of the right of the agent or law enforcement officer
to make such sale and the conclusive evidence of the regularity of the agent's or law enforcement officer's proceedings in making the sale
and shall transfer to the purchaser all right, title and interest in, and to the property sold; and where such property consists of certificates of
stock in the possession of the agent or law enforcement officer, the certificate of sale shall be notice, when received, to any corporation,
company or association of the transfer, and the certificate of such sale shall be authority for such corporation, company or association to
record the transfer on its books and records; and where the subject of sale is securities or other evidences of debt in the possession of the
agent or law enforcement officer, the certificate of sale shall be good and valid evidence of title in the person holding such as against any
other person. Any surplus remaining above the taxes, penalties, interest, costs and expenses of making the seizure, and of advertising the
sale shall be returned to the owner or such other person having a legal right thereto, and, on demand, the director of finance shall render
an account in writing of the sale.
d. Filing And Release Of Lien: Any employee, agent or representative of the town administrator to whom a distraint warrant has been
directed may file a notice of lien in such forms as the director of finance may prescribe with the person in possession of any personal
property or right to property belonging to the taxpayer, and if not previously recorded, the filing of such notice of lien shall operate from the
date of such filing. The director of finance may release the lien as to any part or all of the property or rights to property covered by any
such lien upon such terms as the director of finance may deem proper.
e. Lien Released: Any lien for taxes as shown on the records of the county clerk and recorder as provided in this subsection, upon payment
of all taxes, penalties and interest covered thereby, shall be released by the director of finance in the same manner as mortgages and
judgments are released.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 83/449
a. Action At Law: The director of finance may also treat any such taxes, penalties or interest due and unpaid as a debt due the town from the
taxpayer. In case of failure to pay the tax or any portion thereof or any penalty or interest thereon when due, the director of finance may
receive at law the amount of such taxes, penalties and interest in such county or district court of the county wherein the taxpayer resides or
has a principal place of business having jurisdiction of the amounts sought to be collected. The return of the taxpayer or the assessment
made by the director of finance as provided in this section shall be prima facie proof of the amount due.
b. Writs Of Attachment: Such actions may be actions in attachment and writs of attachment may be issued to the law enforcement officer,
and in any such proceedings no bond shall be required of the director of finance nor shall any law enforcement officer require of the
director of finance an indemnifying bond for executing the writ of attachment or writ of execution upon any judgment entered in such
proceedings, and the director of finance may prosecute appeals or writs of error in such cases without the necessity of providing bond
therefor. It shall be the duty of the town attorney, when requested by the director of finance, to commence action for the recovery of taxes
due under this section, and this remedy shall be in addition to all other existing remedies or remedies provided in this section.
c. Civil Action To Enforce Lien: In any case where there has been a refusal or neglect to pay any tax due the town and a statement or notice
shall have been filed which, under law, creates a lien upon any real property for such tax, the director of finance may cause a civil action to
be filed in the district court of the county in which is situated any real property which is subject to such lien to enforce the lien of the town
for such tax upon the real property situated in that county or in any other county in the state which may be subject to such lien or to subject
any real property or any right, title or interest in real property to the payment of such tax. The court shall decree a sale of such real property
and distribute the proceeds of such sale, according to the findings of such court in respect to the interest of the parties and the town the
proceedings in such action, and the manner of sale, the period for and manner of redemption from such sale and the execution of deed of
conveyance shall be in accordance with the law and practice relating to foreclosures of mortgages upon real property. In any such action,
the court may appoint a receiver of the real property involved in such action if equity so requires. (Ord. 821, 11-11-2003)
2-11-3: REVENUES FROM SALES AND USE TAXES:
A. All revenues received from the collection of sales and use taxes shall be deposited to the general fund of the town except that the board of
trustees shall annually determine the amount of such revenues to be pledged to and deposited in the "capital improvement fund" to be used
solely to provide capital improvements for the town or for the repayment of bonds issued for such purpose; provided however, in the event that
there are outstanding bonds of the town payable from the capital improvement fund, the amount of sales and use tax revenues deposited to the
capital improvement fund shall not be less than the amount necessary to pay the principal of, premium if any, and interest on such bonds when
due.
B. There is hereby created, as authorized in Colorado Revised Statutes section 29-2-111, a special fund of the town to be known as the "capital
improvement fund" for the deposit of all or any portion of the revenue from the town sales tax or use tax, or both, and to be used solely to
provide capital improvements for the town or for the repayment of bonds issued for such purpose. (Ord. 607, 9-3-1998, eff. 1-1-1999)

hereunder, the board of trustees may amend, alter, delete or change the provisions of this chapter by the adoption of an amending ordinance in
accordance with law, and such amendment, alteration, deletion or change need not be submitted to the electors of the town for their approval.

separate violations, must be established by the Town by a preponderance of the evidence at the trial on the merits of any civil action
commenced under this chapter.
G. Procedure:
1. The action to declare and abate a nuisance shall be brought in the Municipal Court by the filing of a complaint, which shall be verified or
supported by an affidavit. A summons shall be issued and served as in civil cases, and any employee of the Town who is over the age of
eighteen (18) may serve the summons and verified complaint upon the respondent.
2. A notice of appearance shall be served with the summons and complaint. The appearance date shall be not less than twenty one (21) days
from the date of service of the summons and complaint.
3. The respondent(s) shall file a response on or before the appearance date set forth in the notice of appearance.
4. Upon the date and time set for appearance, if the respondent has filed no response and fails to appear, and if the Town proves proper
service was made upon the respondent at least twenty one (21) days prior to the appearance date, the court may grant such orders as are
requested by the Town; except that, the court may, in its sole discretion, order that enforcement by the Town be stayed for no more than
seven (7) days and that a copy of the court's abatement order be served on the respondent by first class mail to the last known address of
the respondent, or by posting the same at the subject property.
5. Prior to enforcement of the court's abatement order, for good cause shown by the respondent, provided to the court in writing, with a copy to
the attorney for the Town, the court may set aside or modify the abatement order.
6. The judgment of the Municipal Court may be appealed to the Boulder District Court.
H. Abatement Proceedings: Abatement proceedings under this chapter shall generally be governed by the Colorado Rules of Municipal Court
Procedure unless this chapter provides a more specific rule. Where this chapter, the Colorado Rules of Municipal Court Procedure and the
Colorado Rules of County Court Civil Procedure fail to state a rule of decision, the court shall first look to the Public Nuisance Abatement Act,
Colorado Revised Statutes section 16-13-301, et seq., as amended, and those cases decided thereunder.
I. Remedies Not Delayed: In the event the Town pursues any criminal penalties provided in any other section of this Code, any other civil remedies
or the remedies of any administrative action, the remedies of this chapter shall not be delayed or held in abeyance pending the outcome of any
proceedings in the criminal, civil or administrative action, or any action filed by any other person unless all parties to the action under this
chapter so stipulate in writing to such delay.
J. Abatement Actions Consolidated: Abatement actions under this chapter may be consolidated with another civil action under this chapter
involving the same parcel of real property. Abatement actions under this chapter shall not be consolidated with any other civil or criminal action
except upon the written stipulation of all parties. No party may file any counterclaim, cross-claim, third-party claim or set-off of any kind in any
action under this chapter.
K. Separate Civil Judgments Imposed: In any abatement civil action under this chapter in which a public nuisance is established, in addition to a
permanent abatement order, the court may impose a separate civil judgment on every party/defendant who committed, conducted, promoted,
facilitated, permitted, failed to prevent or otherwise let happen any public nuisance in or on the parcel that is the subject of the public nuisance
action. This civil judgment shall be for the purpose of compensating the Town for the costs it incurred in pursuing the remedies under this
chapter.
L. Restitution: Upon a finding of a nuisance or violation of any provision of this chapter by any person or entity, the court shall order the defendant,
or defendants joint and severally, to pay restitution to the Town for the actual costs or loss caused to the Town by the violation, including but not
limited to administrative expenses, costs to protect the public from the nuisance, court costs and attorney fees.
M. Lien Authorized: The Town is authorized to assess any unpaid costs and expenses for abatement imposed by the court as a lien against the
owner's property and certify such lien to the County Clerk and Recorder for collection in the same manner as Real Estate Taxes against the
property. Each such lien shall have priority over other liens except general taxes and prior special assessments to the extent such priority is not
excluded by State law.
N. Violation Of Injunction Or Order Of Municipal Court: Any violation of any injunction or order issued by the Municipal Court in an action to abate a
nuisance may be punished as contempt of court. Each day's (24 hours) failure to comply with an injunction or order to abate shall constitute a

25-2017)
D. Time Specified; Appeal: It shall be the duty of the owner or occupant of any property, in or upon which any nuisance may be found, to abate the

Administrator.

herein. (Ord. 08-2012, 3-13-2012)
I. Owner Liable; Prosecution: In addition to the penal remedy and abatement procedure set forth in this chapter, any violation of this chapter is a
public nuisance, for which there is no adequate remedy at law, and therefore, any court of competent jurisdiction shall, upon the Town
Attorney's application, enjoin the nuisance, as defined in this chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the Town Attorney from seeking
other appropriate legal or equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction. In addition, the owner/occupant of any property constituting a
nuisance shall be liable to the Town, jointly and severally with every person creating or maintaining the nuisance and the Town Attorney may
commence and prosecute to final judgment an action at law in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect such expenses. As used in this
section, court of competent jurisdiction includes, without limitation, the Erie Municipal Court, which insofar as practicable, shall consider and
determine applications for legal or equitable relief according to the procedures otherwise set forth in this chapter. (Ord. 15-2017, 7-25-2017)

CULTIVATION OF MARIJUANA; MEDICAL, RECREATIONAL
5-3-1: LEGISLATIVE INTENT AND PURPOSE:
A. Legislative Intent: The Erie Board of Trustees intends to regulate the use, acquisition, cultivation, production, and distribution of medical
marijuana and recreational marijuana.
1. The Medical Marijuana Amendment to the Colorado Constitution does not provide a legal manner for patients to obtain medical marijuana
unless the patient grows the marijuana or the marijuana is grown by the patient's primary caregiver. These regulations are intended to apply
10/28/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 126/449
to all medical marijuana operations in the Town whether by a patient or primary caregiver under the Medical Marijuana Amendment. Medical
marijuana cultivation and production can have an impact on health, safety, welfare and community resources and this chapter is intended to
permit medical marijuana cultivation where it will have a minimal impact on the community.
2. The use, distribution, cultivation of recreational marijuana can have an impact on public health, safety, welfare and community resources.
This chapter is intended to permit the cultivation and production of recreational marijuana so that it will have a minimal impact on the
community.
3. Use, distribution, cultivation, production, possession, and transportation of medical and recreational marijuana remains illegal under Federal
law, and marijuana remains classified as a "controlled substance" by Federal law.
4. The regulations for medical and recreational marijuana uses are not adequate at the State level to address the impacts on the Town, making
it appropriate for local regulation of the impacts of medical and recreational marijuana possession, cultivation and uses.
5. There is no reference to or evidence contained in article XVIII, Colorado Constitution to establish that article XVIII, Colorado Constitution is
intended to address or regulate land use, planning, development, or operations of businesses engaging in the production, distribution,
processing or dispensing of medical marijuana. House Bill 17-1220 contemplates local regulation of the cultivation of marijuana for
recreational and medical uses to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public.
6. Nothing in this chapter is intended to promote or condone the production, distribution, or possession of marijuana in violation of any
applicable law.
7. This chapter is to be construed to protect the public health, safety, welfare and resources over the lawful recreational marijuana user,
medical marijuana patient and primary caregiver interests. There is no property right for an individual to possess or cultivate medical
marijuana or recreational marijuana in the Town.
8. Medical marijuana and recreational marijuana is heavily regulated within the Town and the Town has a zero tolerance policy for violations of
this chapter.
9. Article XVIII, section 16, Colorado Constitution, provides that a person over the age of twenty one (21) years of age may lawfully possess,
grow, process or transport no more than six (6) marijuana plants, with three (3) or fewer being mature, flowering plants and possess the
marijuana produced by the plants on the premises where the plants are grown, provided that the growing takes place in an enclosed, locked
space, is not conducted openly or publicly, and is not made available for sale.
10. By virtue of title 31, Colorado Revised Statutes, including but not limited to section 31-15-401 and section 31-15-301, the Town of Erie has
broad authority to exercise its police powers to promote and protect the health, safety and welfare of the community and its inhabitants.
11. Planning and land use regulation are well established as purely matters of local concern.
12. There is no reference or evidence contained in article XVIII, section 16, Colorado Constitution, to establish that it is intended to address or
regulate land use, planning or development related to the lawful growth of recreational marijuana pursuant to the article.
B. Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety and welfare of the residents and patients of the Town by prescribing
the manner in which marijuana may be used, possessed, distributed, cultivated, and produced within the Town. Further, the purpose of this
chapter is to:
1. Provide for means for a medical marijuana patient or primary caregiver to cultivate, produce and process medical marijuana pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter.
2. Protect public health, safety and welfare through reasonable limitations on the cultivation, production and processing of medical and
recreational marijuana as related to noise, air and water quality, food safety, neighborhood and patient safety, security and other health,
safety and welfare concerns.
3. Impose fees to cover the cost to the Town of licensing primary caregivers and registering patients in an amount sufficient for the Town to
recover its costs.
4. Adopt a mechanism for monitoring compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
5. Protect public health, safety and welfare and residential areas by limiting the areas of the Town where more than six (6) medical marijuana
plants may be cultivated, produced or processed.
6. Protect public health, safety and welfare and residential areas by limiting the number of recreational marijuana plants that may be cultivated.
C. Relationship To State Law: The provisions of this chapter that are different from the State law are consistent with the Town's responsibility to
protect the public health, safety and welfare as authorized by Colorado Revised Statutes section 12-43.4-305(3) (as of October 1, 2018, C.R.S.
44-11-304), as amended and by the police powers granted to statutory municipalities pursuant to Colorado Revised Statutes section 31-15-
401, as amended, and by the authority granted municipalities to regulate and govern land use matters within their jurisdiction, pursuant to
Colorado Revised Statutes section 31-23-301, et seq., as amended. Where a provision of this chapter conflicts with the State law, this chapter
shall apply on all matters authorized in Colorado Revised Statutes section 12-43.3-101, et seq., (as of October 1, 2018, C.R.S. 44-11-101, et
seq.), and all matters of local concern. (Ord. 21-2018, 8-14-2018)

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 134/449
A. Criminal Attempt Defined: A person commits "criminal attempt" if, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for commission of an
offense, he or she engages in conduct constituting a substantial step toward the commission of the offense. A substantial step is any conduct,
whether act, omission or possession, which is strongly corroborative of the firmness of the actor's purpose to complete the commission of the
offense. Factual or legal impossibility of committing the offense is not a defense if the offense could have been committed had the attendant
circumstances been as the actor believed them to be, nor is it a defense that the crime attempted was actually perpetrated by the accused.
B. Aiding In Criminal Attempt: A person who engages in conduct intending to aid another to commit an offense commits criminal attempt if the
conduct would establish his or her complicity under section 6-2-3 of this chapter were the offense committed by the other person, even if the
other is not guilty of committing or attempting the offense.
C. Defense: It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the defendant abandoned his or her effort to commit the crime or
otherwise prevented its commission, under circumstances manifesting the complete and voluntary renunciation of his criminal intent. (Ord. 608,
9-24-1998)
6-2-2: CONSPIRACY:
A. A person commits conspiracy to commit a crime if, with the intent to promote or facilitate its commission, he agrees with another person or
persons that they, or one or more of them, will engage in conduct which constitutes a crime or an attempt to commit a crime, or he agrees to
aid the other person or persons in the planning or commission of a crime or of an attempt to commit such crime.
B. No person may be convicted of conspiracy to commit a crime, unless an overt act in pursuance of that conspiracy is proved to have been done
by him or by a person with whom he conspired.
C. If a person knows that one with whom he or she conspires to commit a crime has conspired with another person or persons to commit the same
crime, he or she is guilty of conspiring to commit a crime with the other person, whether or not he or she knows their identity.
D. If a person conspires to commit a number of crimes, he or she is guilty of only one conspiracy so long as such multiple crimes are part of a
single criminal episode. (Ord. 608, 9-24-1998)
6-2-3: COMPLICITY:
A person is legally accountable as principal for the behavior of another constituting a criminal offense if, with the intent to promote or facilitate the
commission of the offense, he or she aids, abets or advises the other person in planning or committing the offense. (Ord. 608, 9-24-1998)
6-2-4: ACCESSORY TO CRIME:
A person is an accessory to crime if, with intent to hinder, delay or prevent the discovery, detection, apprehension, prosecution, conviction or
punishment of another for the commission of a crime, he or she renders assistance to such person. "Render assistance" means to:
A. Harbor or conceal the perpetrator of the crime.
B. Warn such person of impending discovery or apprehension; except, that this does not apply to a warning given in an effort to bring such person
into compliance with the laws.
C. Provide such person with money, transportation, weapon, disguise or other thing to be used in avoiding discovery or apprehension.
D. By force, intimidation or deception, obstruct anyone in the performance of any act which might aid in the discovery, detection, apprehension,

upon the property or posted at reasonable intervals along the property boundary prohibiting trespassing; or

has given oral or written notice that such entry or continued presence is prohibited; or
3. Enter or remain at or refuse to leave any private property when immediately before the entry, remaining or refusal to leave, a police officer or
firefighter acting in the course of his or her employment has given a lawful order that such entry or continued presence is prohibited; or
4. Enter or remain upon or refuse to leave or disperse from any public place after being lawfully ordered to disperse, leave or not enter by any
police officer or firefighter; or

1. Contraband: Contraband shall be destroyed or used for police training purposes.
2. Criminal Instruments:
a. Criminal instrument(s) used by the owner in a criminal episode shall be destroyed or conveyed to the police or town for any use serving a
public purpose unless the owner is exonerated of all charges, including lesser included or lesser nonincluded offenses. Exoneration shall
not include a plea of guilty to any charge in exchange for dismissal of any other charge, a deferred judgment and sentence, or a no contest

from the owner and used without the owner's consent, express or implied, or that the owner was not involved in the criminal acts and
neither knew nor reasonably should have known of those acts. The chief of police or designee shall advise any owner refused the return of

owner after final resolution of any judicial proceedings or if no criminal filings are made, and appropriate due process has been provided to
determine ownership. The police department shall give both the owner and any person claiming to be a good faith purchaser for value
notice pursuant to subsection F of this section and shall notify the town attorney or his designee. The notice shall require the claimant
show proof of ownership or explain the claim to the property within thirty (30) days. If, after thirty (30) days, only one person claims
ownership, the property shall be given that person upon proof of ownership. If two (2) or more parties respond with a claim of ownership,
the municipal court shall have jurisdiction of the property for the purpose of determining ownership. In making its decision, the court shall

A. Submittal: Plans, engineering specifications, diagrams and other data shall be submitted in at least two (2) full sets at the time of application for
a PIP. The plans, etc., submitted shall have been prepared and designed by a registered professional engineer licensed to practice in the state.
Plans and specifications shall be drawn to scale and shall have sufficient clarity to indicate the location, nature, and extent of the work
proposed and show in detail that they conform to town "Construction Standards and Specifications", all relevant laws, ordinances, rules, and
regulations. All plans and specifications will be prepared in accordance with standards of the industry. All construction plans will be checked for
conformance with town construction standards and specifications prior to acceptance and the issuance of a PIP to the applicant. One set will
be returned if changes are required or recommended. Engineering design will remain the responsibility of the professional design engineer
used by the applicant.
B. Acceptance: Upon final acceptance of the plans by the town, a minimum of three (3) sets of plans in a twenty four inch by thirty six inch
(24" x 36") form will be submitted to the town. The plans shall be signed and sealed by the registered professional engineer responsible for the

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 192/449
changes have been recorded and resubmitted to the town on as built drawings, which are in compliance with town "Construction Standards
and Specifications". (Ord. 802, 1-14-2003)
7-2-6: PERMIT FEES:
The fees for a PIP shall be as set forth in section 2-10-4 of this code. These fees shall be calculated on a cumulative basis and shall be paid in full
at the time the plans and specifications have been accepted by the town and a PIP is issued. A PIP shall be required for all public improvement
construction in a public right of way or in a public easement. However, the fee for installation of certain public utilities, i.e., underground electrical,
gas, telephone, cable TV, etc., or construction of town capital improvement projects, may be waived by the town or governed by agreement with
the town. (Ord. 802, 1-14-2003)
7-2-7: EXPIRATION OF APPLICATION REVIEW; EXTENSIONS:
Applications for which no PIP is issued within one hundred eighty (180) days of the date of application shall expire, and any plans or data
submitted for review shall be destroyed or retained by the town, at its discretion, or will be returned to the applicant upon request. If the applicant
makes a written request to extend the application review, the town may extend the life of the application for a further one hundred eighty (180)
days. No application shall be extended more than once. If no action is taken by the applicant to pursue PIP beyond the submittal of the application
after the expiration of the extension, a new application shall be required of the applicant to renew action by the town. Furthermore, should it be
deemed necessary for the town to hire a private consulting firm for the plan review, the applicant shall pay these additional costs. (Ord. 802, 1-14-
2003)
7-2-8: ISSUANCE OF PERMIT:
The town will review the application, plans, specifications, and any other data filed by the applicant for a PIP. Various departments may verify
compliance. If the town finds that the work described in an application is complete and in accordance with the town "Construction Standards and
Specifications" and other pertinent laws, and a permit fee has been paid, a permit will be issued to the applicant. These accepted plans may not be
modified or altered without authorization from the town, and all work will be completed as per the accepted plans. The issuing of a permit based
upon plans, specifications or other data will not prevent the town from requiring the correction of errors in those plans, which were not corrected at
the time of application. In such cases, the town may, at its discretion, stop construction until such corrections, which are necessary, have been
made. (Ord. 802, 1-14-2003)
7-2-9: EXPIRATION OF PERMIT:
Every PIP issued by the town shall expire if the work authorized by the PIP is substantially completed. "Substantially completed" shall mean that all
public improvements are operable as determined by an inspection by the town. If it is determined that the project is delayed, abandoned, or work
has stopped for no apparent reason, the project shall cease, and a new permit will be required to complete the project. The new permit will require
a fee of twenty five percent (25%) of the original permit price, provided no changes to the accepted plans have been made. Should the accepted
approved plans be changed, a new PIP permit and fees are required. In no case shall an extension of a PIP cause a site to be left in such a state
as to create a hazard or nuisance. (Ord. 802, 1-14-2003)
7-2-10: WORKING WITHOUT A PERMIT; INVESTIGATION FEES:
Any work performed, which is not covered by an issued PIP, shall cease upon written notice of the town. An investigation fee shall be levied which
is equal to the amount of the PIP fee, plus any fees required for investigation time. These cumulative fees shall be collected whether or not a
proper PIP is issued after the investigation. The payment of such investigation fees shall not exempt any person from compliance with all other
provisions of this chapter nor from any other penalty prescribed by law. (Ord. 802, 1-14-2003)
7-2-11: INSPECTIONS:
A. Inspection Required; Notice: All construction work for which a PIP is required shall be subject to inspection by the town, and special types of
construction shall be required to have continuous inspections by special inspectors. It is the responsibility of the applicant or designated
representatives of the applicant to notify the town that the work performed is ready for inspection. Every request for inspection shall be filed at
least three (3) days before inspection is desired, unless an early inspection is made necessary by prior agreement with the town. An inspection
request shall be made in writing or by telephone call to the appropriate town employee, at the option of the town and on a case by case basis.
The person requesting inspection shall provide access to the site and work to be inspected by the town.
B. Defective Work: The town shall have the authority to halt construction when the accepted plans and/or town regulations governing construction
have not been adhered to, or the work is otherwise defective. The town shall give the applicant written notice of the deficiencies to be corrected
and the time frame in which the corrections are expected to be completed, and may order further construction to cease until all deficiencies are
corrected. If the deficiencies are not corrected by the time frame specified, the town may evoke enforcement options authorized by this chapter,
and/or any performance guarantees under which the work is being performed.
C. Final Inspection: The procedure for final inspection and acceptance will be by mutual agreement between the town and the applicant, or as
specified in any contract documents or as provided by applicable town regulations.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 193/449
D. Additional Inspections And Reinspection: The town may make or require any additional inspections of any work as deemed necessary to
ascertain and ensure compliance with this chapter, any other applicable town ordinances, and town regulations concerning construction. A
reinspection fee may be assessed for each inspection or reinspection when such portion of work for which inspection is called is not complete
or when corrections called for have not been made. Reinspection fees may be assessed when the permit and the accepted plans are not at the
work site in the possession of the permit holder or the permit holder's agent and readily available to the inspector, or for deviating from the
plans accepted by the town. This section is not to be interpreted as requiring reinspection fees the first time a job is rejected for failure to
comply with town regulations concerning construction, but rather as controlling the practice of calling for inspections before a job is ready for
such inspection or reinspection. (Ord. 802, 1-14-2003)
7-2-12: VIOLATIONS:
Failure to comply with the terms of this chapter shall constitute an offense, punishable as provided in title 1, chapter 4 of this code. Each separate
day or any portion thereof during which violation of any provision appearing in this division occurs or continues shall be deemed or constituted as a
separate offense. A violation shall be reason for cease and desist of the project. (Ord. 802, 1-14-2003; amd. 2004 Code)

the town arborist, to abate the same within the time specified in the written notice. Timely filing of an appeal from the abatement notice shall
extend the time for abatement until a final ruling on the appeal is issued. In addition to any other available sanction or relief, if such
owner/occupant fails to comply with the requirements of the abatement order within the specified time, he or she commits a violation of this
chapter.
5. Administrator Authority To Abate: The town administrator, or designee, shall be duly authorized to abate any nuisance specified in this
chapter, which shall include authority to engage the necessary assistance and incur necessary expense therefor.
6. Expense Recovery: The expense incurred by the town in abating any nuisance as provided herein may be recovered by proper action from

connection therewith.
8. Appeal And Hearing: Any appeal of an abatement notice and order filed by the owner/occupant shall be filed with the office of the town clerk
within five (5) days of the date of the notice. Failure to file an appeal by the deadline shall be a waiver of the right to appeal. The appeal shall
be heard and determined by a hearing officer appointed by the town administrator. The hearing officer shall determine the procedure
applicable to the administrative hearing. The hearing shall be informal, the rules of procedure related to formal court cases shall not apply,
nor shall the rules of evidence. The hearing officer shall determine, in a written order, whether the basis of the abatement notice and order is

notice and order, he shall set the date by which the owner/occupant shall bring the property into compliance.

The appellant carries the burden of proof to establish that the charges are unreasonable, by a preponderance of the evidence. The hearing
officer shall affirm, modify or vacate the charges to abate the nuisance. The written ruling of the hearing officer shall be provided to the
appellant and the town clerk. If the hearing officer affirms the assessment, in whole or in part, the owner/occupant shall pay the amount in
full by the deadline established in the written order of the hearing officer. In the event timely payment is not received, the town clerk may
certify the charges to the clerk of the county treasurer as provided herein.
C. Additional Remedies: In addition to the penal remedy and abatement procedures set forth in this chapter, any violation of this chapter is a public
nuisance, for which there is no adequate remedy at law, and therefore any court of competent jurisdiction shall, upon the town attorney's
application, enjoin the nuisance, as defined in this chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the town attorney from seeking other
appropriate legal or equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction. In addition, the owner/occupant of any property constituting a
nuisance shall be liable to the town, jointly and severally with every person creating or maintaining the nuisance, for the town's reasonable
expenses incurred in abating the nuisance and the town attorney may commence and prosecute to final judgment an action at law in any court
of competent jurisdiction to collect such expenses. As used in this subsection, court of competent jurisdiction includes, without limitation, the
Erie municipal court, which insofar as practicable, shall consider and determine applications for legal or equitable relief according to procedures
otherwise applicable to proceedings in Colorado county courts.

safety or welfare in imminent danger, the town administrator, town arborist or designee, may issue an emergency abatement order, which
shall comply with subsection B of this section, except the emergency abatement order shall:
a. Allow a shorter time period, as is reasonable considering the circumstances, to abate the nuisance;
b. State that if the nuisance remains unabated at the end of the time period given to correct the nuisance, the town administrator, town
arborist or designee, will cause abatement of the nuisance according to this section;

abatement.
2. Timely filing of an appeal from the emergency abatement order shall not extend the time for abatement.
3. If the nuisance remains at the end of the reasonable time given, the town administrator shall cause abatement of the nuisance according to
subsection B5 of this section.

and the town shall not recover abatement costs as a charge or lien against property. (Ord. 21-2016, 7-12-2016)

E. Public Parks And Open Space: No tap fee shall be charged for irrigation of new public parks and open space owned by the Town. (Ord. 23-
2019, 8-13-2019)
F. Fire Control Prevention:
1. Water for automatic fire control protection systems shall only be provided to properties which are connected to the Town's water system
pursuant to the terms of this chapter.
2. In the event a person desires or is required to provide automatic fire control protection for emergency service only which requires a tap larger

such conditions as the Town Board may deem proper. (Ord. 32-2005, 9-13-2005)
8-1-9: WATER RIGHTS DEDICATIONS:
A. Intent And Purpose: It is the intent and purpose of this chapter to require the payment of fees in lieu of water dedication for all uses except the
irrigation of parks and open space. For parks and open space, a person may elect to either pay such fees or dedicate water rights to the Town.
Any payment of fees in lieu of water dedication or dedication of water rights required for the irrigation of parks and open space shall be
sufficient to satisfy any new or additional demand for Town water service resulting from the extension of water service, or any change in land
10/28/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 210/449
use, within or outside the limits of the Town, which will require new or additional water supply from the Town, and thereby to assure an
adequate and stable supply of water to all Town water users, to ensure the financial stability of the Town water utility, and to promote the
general welfare of the public. However, water dedication or payment of fees in lieu of water dedication shall not be required for irrigation of new
public parks and open space owned by the Town or for new public buildings owned by the Town. (Ord. 23-2019, 8-13-2019)
B. Dedication Required:
1. From and after the effective date hereof, any person who seeks approval of any of the following:
a. An extension of water service;
b. Subdivision; (Ord. 32-2005, 9-13-2005)
c. Any change in land use, within or outside the limits of the Town, if such change in land use will increase the demand for Town water
service shall comply with this section by paying fees in lieu of water dedication for all uses except the irrigation of parks and open space.
For parks and open space, a person may elect to either pay such fees or dedicate water rights for the irrigation of parks and open space in
accordance with this chapter. Wastewater from in house or in building uses shall either be treated by the Town's Municipal wastewater
treatment facilities or other wastewater treatment facilities of equal efficiency which provide similar return flow patterns. If wastewater from
in house or in building uses will not be treated by the Town's Municipal wastewater treatment facilities or other wastewater treatment
facilities of equal efficiency and which provide similar return flow patterns, the Town shall increase the fee in lieu of water dedication
requirement so that, after the payment of such fees, the water rights to be purchased by the Town will produce an amount of deliverable
and fully consumable water per year for each SFE which is sufficient to ensure an adequate supply of water to satisfy the proposed use or
uses. However, water dedication or payment of fees in lieu of water dedication shall not be required for irrigation of new public parks and
open space owned by the Town or for new public buildings owned by the Town. (Ord. 23-2019, 8-13-2019)
2. Any person who elects to dedicate water rights to the Town for irrigation of parks and open space pursuant to this chapter, shall designate,
on forms to be prescribed by the Town, all water rights proposed to be dedicated to the Town and shall provide a legal description of the land
for which an extension of water service is requested or for which approval of subdivision or a change in land use is sought and, in addition,
shall provide a water and sewer demand analysis in conformance with subsection C of this section. The form shall be accompanied by a
historical use affidavit; except, that if the total number of acre feet is greater than fifteen (15) acre feet, the Town may, in its discretion,
require, in addition to the historical use affidavit, an engineering report prepared at said person's expense by an engineer experienced in
water rights matters, which report is determined by the Town to sufficiently analyze the historical use of the water right(s) proposed for
dedication to the Town.
3. Thereafter, the Town shall make a determination as to whether or not the water rights are sufficient to satisfy the requirements of this
subsection. In making such determination, the Town shall consult with person(s) knowledgeable in water rights matters.
4. The Town shall have the right to make a redetermination of the water rights dedicated to the Town for the irrigation of parks and open space
in the event that revisions to the proposed extension of water service, subdivision, or change in land use are made subsequent to the
determination set forth in subsection B3 of this section.
5. The dedication requirement shall be satisfied by the person seeking approval of the extension of water service, subdivision or a change in
land use, whether or not that person will be the ultimate user of the Town water service.
6. All costs and expenses to dedicate water rights to the Town to satisfy the requirements of this subsection, or to dedicate water rights which
the Town has otherwise accepted in accordance with subsection E of this section, shall be paid by the person required to dedicate water
rights to the Town pursuant to this chapter or his successors or assigns. All costs and expenses necessary to change such water rights so
they can be diverted and used by the Town for Municipal use shall be paid by the person required to dedicate water rights to the Town
pursuant to this section, or his successors or assigns, by payment of all required water court transfer fees and administrative fees. All such
fees shall be paid prior to approval of an extension of water service, subdivision or change in land use. Said fees shall be paid pursuant to a
fee agreement with the Town.
7. Any person required to pay the Town fees in lieu of water dedication, as defined above, shall convey to the Town all nontributary and not
nontributary ground water underlying the land to be served. Said ground water shall be in addition to any water dedication hereunder, and no
credit shall be given to said water for dedication purposes.
C. Water And Sewer Demand Analysis:
1. Any person required to pay the Town fees in lieu of water dedication shall include with the subdivision submittal, or the request for extension
of water service or change in land use, a written analysis sufficient to allow the Town to fully evaluate the probable water demand and
consumption and the sewer service requirements for all uses of the property to be developed, except single-family residential use that meets
the definition of a "single-family equivalent unit (SFE)" in section 8-1-3 of this chapter. Said water demand analysis shall be based upon the
specific development plan proposed by such annexor, developer or owner. The analysis shall include the entire property and shall specify the
use of all land in the property. Water demands and consumption shall be estimated separately for all use categories except property which is
platted and developed for single-family residential use that meets the definition of an SFE in section 8-1-3 of this chapter (e.g., single-family
residential units that do not meet the definition of an SFE in section 8-1-3 of this chapter: multi-family residential, commercial, office,
industrial, parks, open space or others), and irrigation demands and consumptive use shall be set forth separately for each use category
which is applicable to the property.
2. The Town may elect to provide its own analysis, if, in its judgment, the Town has sufficient information and experience with other similar
developments to adequately evaluate the probable water demands and consumption and the sewer service requirements for the property. If
the Town and the developer or owner agree on applicable criteria for the property, the Town may advise such person that he is not required
to submit the written analysis provided for in subsection C1 of this section.
D. Dedication Of Rights For Park, Open Space Or Recreation Use:
10/28/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 211/449
1. If any person required to pay the Town fees in lieu of water dedication also dedicates land to the Town pursuant to this Code, and such land
is to be used for park, irrigated open space or recreation uses, such person shall also comply with the provisions of this section, including the
dedication of water rights pursuant to this chapter or payment of fees in lieu of water dedication sufficient to irrigate said land, as determined
by the Town.
2. Where the Town Board enters into an agreement to accept cash in lieu of in kind land dedication for parks, open space or recreation uses,
and the Town is unable to specifically determine the irrigation demand for the public project for which the cash is contributed from a specific
Town construction plan, master plan or otherwise, the amount of water right dedication, or cash in lieu of water right dedication, at the Town
Board's discretion, which shall be required to meet the requirements of subsection D1 of this section shall be equal to the amount required to
irrigate eighty percent (80%) of the land area which otherwise would have been required for in kind land dedication by this Code.
E. Procedure:
1. Subsections E2, E3, E4 and E5 of this section apply only to lands which are annexed to the Town after the effective date hereof.
2. The Town shall include in any annexation, subdivision, development or similar agreements, provisions addressing whether or not there is any
commitment on behalf of the Town to provide water or sewer service.
3. At the time of annexation, the annexor shall elect to do one or more of the following: a) offer for dedication to the Town all water rights
appurtenant to the property to be annexed; b) offer for dedication to the Town water rights which are not appurtenant to the property to be
annexed; or c) not to offer for dedication to the Town all water rights appurtenant to the property to be annexed. The Town may, in its
discretion, and using the criteria set forth in this section, consider and accept for dedication water rights offered by the annexor which are not
appurtenant to the property to be annexed. The Town shall determine whether any such water rights in items a or b of this subsection offered
to the Town for dedication will be accepted, rejected or accepted in part by the Town for dedication.
4. In the event the annexor elects not to offer for dedication to the Town all water rights appurtenant to the property to be annexed which the
Town desires to acquire, the Town shall provide in the annexation, subdivision, development and other similar agreements that: a) there is no
commitment by the Town at the time of approval of the annexation to provide water or sewer service to the property; or b) the annexor,
developer or owner shall not be entitled to provide cash in lieu payments to the Town until after such time as all appurtenant water rights
have been offered to the Town for dedication. If the developer later elects to offer all such appurtenant water rights and the Town accepts
them for dedication, the timing and extent of any commitment to provide water or sewer service shall be limited by the completion of any
necessary water court proceedings by the Town. If any water rights offered to the Town for dedication exceed the amount required by this
policy, subsection H of this section shall apply. (Ord. 32-2005, 9-13-2005)
5. a. The Town shall evaluate any water rights offered to the Town for dedication. The Town shall determine whether said water rights are to be
accepted based upon the following criteria: priority date, historical point of diversion, location of historical use, historical yield, historical
consumptive use, the contribution to historical consumptive use of other water rights or sources of water supply, future use of the land
historically irrigated, including future irrigation, considerations with respect to title, anticipated difficulties with transferring the water rights to
appropriate points of diversion, places of storage and Municipal uses, the Town's contractual obligations and arrangements, expected needs
of the Town and of the Town's Municipal water supply system, composition of the Town's water rights portfolio at the time of the proposed
annexation, and any other appropriate factors. For purposes of this Code, it is assumed that units of the Colorado Big Thompson Project
(CBT units) have a firm annual yield of one-half (0.5) acre foot per unit. (Ord. 13-A-2006, 4-11-2006)
b. Any water court transfer fees or administrative fees shall be paid not later than the time of approval of the final plat(s) to which the water
right dedication is applicable.
6. The Town reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to accept, reject or accept in part any water rights proposed for dedication to the Town.
7. No water taps shall be issued by the Town unless sufficient water right dedications and/or fees in lieu payments have been accepted by the
Town to provide sufficient water supply for the demands projected for such taps in accordance with the terms of this section.
8. No extension of water service, including any new or additional water service, shall be furnished until there has been full compliance with the
provisions of this section, unless the Town Board determines by resolution or written agreement that one or more of the exceptions set forth
in subsection J of this section apply.
9. The Town reserves the right to review projected water usage and actual water usage within a project at any time to confirm the adequacy of
the water demand projections made by the annexor, developer or owner, and to require additional water rights dedication and/or cash in lieu
payments based on actual water usage.
10. All costs and expenses related to the dedication of water rights to the Town shall be borne by the person required to dedicate water rights to
the Town pursuant to this section.
11. In the event the water rights offered to the Town for dedication provide raw water credits in excess of those required by this policy, such
excess water rights shall be offered for sale to the Town at current fair market value. The Town may enter into a written agreement to
purchase all or part of any such excess water rights and, in the event the Town does not then purchase all of such excess water rights, the
Town may require the annexor, developer or owner to grant to the Town a right of first refusal to purchase such excess water rights in the
future, pursuant to the provisions of subsection H of this section.
12. All determinations provided for herein shall be made by the Town in the exercise of its reasonable judgment and shall be consistent with
this section.
13. All dedications of water rights to the Town hereunder shall be effected by delivering to the Town sufficient warranty deeds, stock certificates
with appropriate stock assignments, accompanied by satisfactory dry up covenants, or by written approval by the northern Colorado water
conservancy district of the transfer of any allotment contracts, as is appropriate to the particular transaction. All title documents shall be
subject to approval by the Town's Attorneys. No water right dedication shall be considered completed until the Town has accepted sufficient
documents transferring title to the Town. (Ord. 32-2005, 9-13-2005)
10/28/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 212/449
F. Fees In Lieu Of Dedication: The Town shall require fees in lieu of water dedication to satisfy all dedication requirements for all uses on lands
annexed to the Town; which are provided water service by the Town except, that a person may elect to dedicate water rights for the irrigation of
parks and open space in accordance with the requirements of this section, or as may be provided in an intergovernmental agreement. When
the Town determines the amounts of fees in lieu of water dedication, the amounts of fees shall include the cost of units in the Colorado Big
Thompson Project (CBT units) necessary to satisfy the dedication requirement, determined as of the date of actual payment by the developer
or owner, which value shall include any transaction costs, interest and all other costs incurred or to be incurred by the Town in acquiring water
rights for the Town's system as set forth in section 2-10-6 of this Code. The firm annual yield of a CBT unit for purposes of this chapter is onehalf
(0.5) acre foot per unit. All determinations required by this section shall be made by the Town in its sole judgment. However, water
dedication or payment of fees in lieu of water dedication shall not be required for irrigation of new public parks and open space owned by the
Town or for new public buildings owned by the Town. (Ord. 23-2019, 8-13-2019)
G. Agricultural And Open Space Property: If the owner of any property proposed to be annexed or subdivided, or on which the land use is
proposed to be changed resulting in an increased demand for Town water service, desires to retain the land, or any portion thereof, in
agricultural production or as open space prior to development, he may, pursuant to written agreement with the Town, be permitted to lease
back, on an annual basis and for irrigation, aesthetic and recreational purposes only, all or part of the water rights dedicated to the Town
pursuant to this chapter. The terms of any such leases shall be at fair market value, as determined by the Town, and on such other terms and
conditions as are determined by the Town. Said leases shall provide that in the event any portion of the land for which the water is leased is
platted during the term of the lease, the Town may cancel the lease, in whole or in part, to the extent any portion of the leased water is
determined by the Town to be necessary for water service to the property so platted.
H. Option To Purchase Or Right Of First Refusal:
1. Option To Purchase:
a. Option Granted: Prior to any extension of water service, any person required to comply with the provisions of this section shall also grant
to the Town the option for one year to purchase any and all water rights which are appurtenant to the land to be subdivided, or on which
the land use is proposed to be changed, but which are in excess of the dedication requirements of this section. The option may be
exercised by the Town at any time within the period of one year following the date of the grant to the Town with regard to any or all of the
water rights subject to the grant.
b. Price:
(1) The option price shall be that price agreed upon by the parties. If the parties cannot agree upon an option price within thirty (30) days
after notice of the Town's intent to exercise its option is received by the owner, appraisal at the Town's expense will establish the price
that reflects the fair market value of the water right(s).
(2) The appraisal shall be conducted by one appraiser appointed by the Town, one appraiser appointed by the owner of the water rights,
and a third appraiser who shall be appointed by both parties. The average of the three (3) appraisals shall be the option price. All three
(3) appraisers must have at least ten (10) years' experience in appraising water rights in Colorado.
2. Right Of First Refusal:
a. Grant Of Right: In addition to the grant to the Town of the option to purchase water rights as provided in subsection H1a of this section,
any person required to comply with the dedication requirements shall also grant to the Town a right of first refusal regarding any water
rights subject to said option to purchase. If the Town for any reason should choose not to exercise its option to purchase water rights as
provided in subsection H1a of this section, the Town shall have the right of first refusal in the event the water rights are to be sold
separately from the land, for a period of ten (10) years following the date of the grant to the Town.
b. Notice Period: If the owner of the water rights subject to the right of first refusal wishes to sell the water rights to a third party, he shall give
the Town at least ninety (90) days' prior written notice of his intention to effect a sale of the water rights by delivering to the Town an
acceptable bona fide written offer to purchase made by a third party. (Ord. 32-2005, 9-13-2005)
c. Exercise Of Right: During the ninety (90) day notice period provided for in subsection H2b of this section, the Town shall enjoy its right of
first refusal entitling it to purchase the water rights offered for sale on the same terms and conditions as contained in the acceptable bona
fide written offer. If, within ninety (90) days following notice by the owner of his intention to sell his water rights, the Town chooses to
exercise its right to purchase, then the Town shall so notify the owner in writing and shall proceed to closing on the terms and conditions
contained in the acceptable bona fide written offer by the third party. In the event that the Town determines not to exercise its right to
purchase the water rights offered for sale, the owner shall be free to sell the water rights to the third party; provided, however, that any
such sale to the third party shall be for a price which is at least equal to that price which was tendered to and refused by the Town, and on
terms and conditions which are no more favorable to the third party than those refused by the Town. (Ord. 13-A-2006, 4-11-2006)
I. Return Flows And Augmentation; Exchange Or Reuse Plans:
1. The Town shall have dominion and control of all water supplied through its water system, subject to reasonable use thereof by its customers
in compliance with applicable water service agreements, leases or licenses or the Town ordinances. Such dominion and control shall
continue without interruption as to all wastewater, return flows, runoff, sewage or tail water attributable to or originating in water supplied
through Town owned or controlled water rights or facilities.
2. The Town shall have the exclusive right to recapture such return flows or claim credit therefrom for reuse, successive use, exchange,
replacement, augmentation, substitute supply or any other lawful purposes, and the Town's dominion and control over water shall continue to
attach to all such return flows, regardless of form, even after they return to the ground water aquifers or the surface stream systems.
3. All return flows from water supplied through Town owned or controlled water rights or facilities remain the property of the Town.
J. Exceptions:

1. This section does not apply to an extension of water service for which the dedication requirements have been previously satisfied.
2. The Town Board may determine that certain provisions of this section may be inapplicable to certain developments or portions of
developments, or the application of said chapter should be deferred in time or on certain conditions, if there is existing water service from a
water district or the Town believes all or part of the development would be better served by the water district, either temporarily or
permanently. Any such determinations shall be set out expressly in the annexation, development and other similar agreements relating to
water service. (Ord. 32-2005, 9-13-2005)
8-1-10: WATER CONSERVATION:

"Town of Erie water conservation program, enforcement response plan, policies, and procedures" mandatory through a Town Board
resolution.
3. The requirements for water conservation are voluntary unless made mandatory through a Town Board resolution.
D. Emergency Water Restrictions: The Town Administrator may establish water usage hours and restrictions for the safety and welfare of the
Town. (Ord. 32-2005, 9-13-2005)
8-1-11: WASTE OF WATER:
A. Waste Of Water Prohibited: All waste of water from the Town water system is prohibited. A "waste of water" is defined, for purposes of this
chapter, as any use of water which is not applied to a beneficial use. A waste of water may be evidenced by the presence of outdoor irrigation
water on paved surfaces.
B. Leaks In Water Lines: Any leak(s) that occurs in a water line is to be repaired within ten (10) days of discovery of said leak, and the user will be
charged for any water that is lost as a result of water leaks on the water users' side of the water connection, and said water user will be
charged for any water passing through the meter whether actually used or not.
C. Notice Of Violation; Termination Of Service; Surcharge: Since waste of water may cause a situation of jeopardy to the Town during periods of
limited water availability, the Town may, by the Town Administrator or his or her duly authorized agent, give notice in writing to any water user
that the water use by that person constitutes an apparent waste of water, as the Town Administrator may reasonably determine, on a
comparative usage basis of general water use by persons in reasonably similar situations. After receipt of such written notice, if such waste of
water is not remedied and appropriately reduced, the Town Administrator, after appropriate hearing and consideration, may terminate the
offending person's water service, or may levy a monthly excess water use surcharge or fine, not to exceed three hundred dollars ($300.00) in
any given month, on the water user. Any surcharge or fine as provided herein shall be in addition to any other penalties or violations as
permitted under section 8-1-19 of this chapter. (Ord. 32-2005, 9-13-2005)
8-1-12: HEALTH HAZARDS:

prior to installation. If the test is made by the manufacturer, certification of the test and result will be furnished to the Town prior to installation.
C. Interfering With Or Bypassing Meters:
1. Interference Or Bypass Prohibited: It shall be unlawful for any water user or for any other person other than an authorized employee of the
Town to tamper or interfere with any meter or meter seal. All meters must have immediate and unhampered access at all times. No act will
be performed by any person(s) that will alter the flow of water and/or accurate registration of the meter.
2. Violation; Discontinuance Of Service: A violation of this provision shall be cause for immediate discontinuance of water service to any water
user found to be in violation of this subsection, as well as subject the person or entity to those violations and penalties as set forth in section
8-1-19 of this chapter.
3. Appeals: In the event the Town immediately discontinues water service based upon a violation of this subsection, the person against whom
the violation is brought may appeal the discontinuance of water service to the Town Administrator by written request within five (5) days of
the discontinuance of the water service. Failure to make such a request for a hearing shall constitute a waiver of any right to appeal the
discontinuance of water service.
4. Additional Enforcement: Discontinuance of water service shall in no way limit the Town from enforcing the violations and penalties provisions
as set forth in section 8-1-19 of this chapter.
D. New Construction: A water meter is required to obtain water for construction unless a hydrant meter is obtained pursuant to subsection G of this
section for individual units. Upon installation of a water meter for construction purposes, the water meter will be considered permanent, and the

acceptance by the Town.
F. Maintenance Required: All water meters and appurtenances shall be maintained by the Town, and shall be tested as reasonably necessary and
shall be kept in accurate working order at all times. If the Town tests a meter at the request of a property owner, and the meter is determined to
be accurate, the property owner shall pay the current fee for said testing.
G. Hydrant Meters: Any and all construction not addressed in subsection D of this section requiring Town water shall be controlled by the use of a
hydrant meter obtained from the Town pursuant to the following requirements:
1. Deposit Required: Prior to the assignment of a hydrant meter, a hydrant meter deposit is required as provided in section 2-10-4 of this Code.
The deposit shall be paid to the Town Finance Department which shall issue a receipt. When the receipt is presented to the Director of Public
Works, a hydrant meter will be issued with the proper location assignment. The deposit will be held until such time as the hydrant meter has
been returned and the water usage paid in full.
2. Charges:

standard or requirement. The POTW may impose mass limitations on industrial users who are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment
standards or pretreatment requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
G. Garbage Grinders: Garbage grinders may be connected to sanitary sewers from homes, hotels, institutions, restaurants, hospitals, catering
establishment or similar places where garbage originates from the preparation of food in kitchens for the purpose of consumption on the
premises or when served by caterers. However, garbage grinders shall only be used to grind small amounts of garbage incidental to cleaning of
plates and cookware, and not to dispose of large quantities of waste. Waste must be scraped into a garbage can prior to cleaning. (Ord. 22-

expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the Town for review and approval before such
facilities are constructed. Approval by the Town of any such facilities shall not be construed as a guarantee or agreement by the Town that such
facilities will achieve compliance with this chapter. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the industrial user
from the responsibility of modifying such facilities, as necessary, to produce a discharge acceptable to the Town.
B. Additional Pretreatment And Monitoring Requirements:
1. The Town may require an industrial user to restrict its discharge, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers,
relocate or consolidate points of discharge, separate domestic waste streams from non-domestic waste streams, and impose such other

A. Notice Of Violation: When the Town finds that an industrial user is in violation of any provision of this chapter, the Town may issue a written
notice of violation. Within five (5) days of receipt of such notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and
prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the industrial user to the Town. Submission of such a plan in no
way relieves the industrial user of liability for any violations. If the plan for correction submitted by the industrial user is not satisfactory to the
Town, the Town may take further action, including potentially suspending service. Nothing in this subsection shall limit the authority of the Town
to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
B. Suspension Of Service: The Town may suspend water service or wastewater treatment service to stop an actual or threatened discharge which
presents an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health, safety or welfare of persons or the environment, causes pass through or
interference, causes the Town to violate any condition of its NPDES permit, or violates this chapter. Any industrial user notified of a suspension
of the water service or wastewater treatment service shall immediately stop or eliminate the discharge. In the event of a failure of the industrial
user to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Town shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including without limitation
immediate physical severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to individuals or
the environment.
C. Administrative Order: When the Town finds that an industrial user is in violation of any provision of this chapter, the Town may issue an order to
the industrial user responsible for the discharge directing that the industrial user immediately come into compliance or within a time specified by
the Town. If the industrial user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate
treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders may also contain other
requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount
of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard
or pretreatment requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the industrial user of liability for any violation during the time it takes the
industrial user to come into compliance. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action
against the industrial user. (Ord. 22-2019, 8-13-2019)

vested property right.

procedures of this chapter by specific written request to the town. The request shall be made to the director of the community development
department at least thirty (30) days prior to the date the board of trustees is to consider approval of the site specific development plan. The
failure of the landowner to make such a request renders the final plat approval or final site improvement plan approval not a site specific
development plan, and no vested property rights shall be deemed to be created by its approval.
C. No site specific development plan shall be approved until after a board of trustees' public hearing, preceded by notice of the hearing published
at least once in a newspaper designated by the town for the publication of notices. The notice shall be published by the town at least fifteen
(15) days prior to the board of trustees' hearing date and may, at the town's option, be combined with any notice required for the final plat
approval or final site improvement plan approval or with any other required notice, or may be given separately. Interested persons shall have
the opportunity to be heard at the public hearing.

specific development plan.

shall prevent the creation of a vested property right. (Ord. 684, 12-14-1999; amd. Ord. 24-08, 8-12-2008)

A. A vested property right which has been created pursuant to this chapter shall remain vested for a period of three (3) years, unless a longer
period is expressly authorized by board of trustees ordinance, resolution or agreement.
B. The three (3) year vesting period shall not be extended by any amendments to a site specific development plan. Therefore, in the event the
town board approves a site specific development plan, the effective date of such amendments, for purposes of duration of any vested property
right, shall be the date of the town board's approval of the original site specific development plan, unless the board of trustees, by ordinance,
resolution or agreement, expressly finds and determines otherwise. Vested property rights shall not attach to any administrative amendment
and may attach to amendments to the site specific development plan only if such amendments are approved in compliance with the procedures
set forth in the town ordinances and requirements. (Ord. 684, 12-14-1999; amd. Ord. 24-08, 8-12-2008)

applicable to all property subject to land use regulation by the town, including, but not limited to, building, fire, plumbing, electrical, and
mechanical codes. Further, the establishment of a vested property right shall not preclude the application of ordinances or regulations as
otherwise permitted by Colorado Revised Statutes title 24, article 68, as amended.
C. A site specific development plan for which a vested right has been created shall not be exempt from subsequent reviews and approvals to
ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the plan's approval. (Ord. 684, 12-14-1999; amd. Ord. 24-08, 8-12-2008)

C. Floodplain Overlay District (FPO):
1. Findings Of Fact: The flood hazard areas of the Town are subject to periodic inundation which could possibly result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the overall tax base. All of which could collectively have an adverse effect on public health, safety
and general welfare.
Such potential flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights
and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or
otherwise protected from flood damage may also contribute to the flood loss.
2. Purpose: To promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, to minimize flood losses in areas subject to flood hazards, and to
promote wise use of the floodplain, this section has been established with the following purposes intended:
a. To reduce the potential hazard of floods to life and property through:
(1) Prohibiting certain uses which may be dangerous to life or property during a flood.
(2) Restricting land uses which may be hazardous to the public health during a flood.
(3) Restricting land uses which are particularly susceptible to flood damage, so as to alleviate hardship and minimize demands for public
expenditures for relief and protection.
(4) Requiring permitted floodplain uses, including public facilities which serve such uses, to be protected against flood by providing
floodproofing and general flood protection at the time of initial construction.
(5) Restricting or prohibiting uses which are known to be dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or
which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
(6) Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction.
b. To protect floodplain occupants from a flood which is or may be caused by their own or other land use and which is or may be undertaken
without full realization of the danger, through:
(1) The prohibition of residential uses from being platted in the floodplain.
(2) Regulating the manner in which structures designed for human occupancy may be constructed so as to prevent danger to human life
within such structures.
(3) Regulating the method of construction of water supply and sanitation systems so as to prevent disease, contamination and unsanitary
conditions.
(4) Delineating and describing areas that could be inundated by floods so as to protect individuals from purchasing floodplain lands for
purposes which are not in fact suitable.
(5) Minimizing the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding which are generally undertaken at the expense of the general
public.
(6) Minimizing prolonged business interruptions.
(7) Ensuring that potential buyers in the area are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard.
(8) Ensuring that those who occupy flood hazard areas assume responsibility for their actions.
c. To protect the public from the burden of avoidable financial expenditures for flood control and relief by:
(1) Regulating all uses within the floodplain areas so as to produce a method of construction and a pattern of development which will
minimize the probability of damage to property and loss of life or injury to the inhabitants of the flood hazard areas.
(2) Minimizing damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and
bridges located in areas of special flood hazard.
(3) Helping maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development in flood hazard areas and to minimize future flood
hazard areas.
d. To protect the flood water storage capacity of floodplains and to assure retention of sufficient floodway area to convey flood flows which
can reasonably be expected to occur by:
(1) Regulating filling, dumping, dredging, and alteration of channels by deepening, widening, or relocating.
(2) Prohibiting unnecessary and damage creating encroachments.
10/28/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 267/449
(3) Encouraging uses such as agriculture, recreation and parking.
(4) Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood water elevations or velocities.
e. To protect the hydraulic characteristics of the small watercourses, including the gulches, sloughs and artificial water channels used for
conveying floodwaters, which make up a portion of the urban drainage system, by:
(1) Regulating filling, dumping, and channelization so as to maintain the natural storage capacity and slow flow characteristics.
(2) Regulating encroachment into the small watercourses to maintain their natural storage capacity and slow flow characteristics.
(3) Encouraging uses such as greenbelt, open space, recreation, and pedestrian and non-motorized vehicle trails.
(4) Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
floodwaters.
(5) Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase damage caused by flooding.
(6) Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which could divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
3. General Provisions:
a. Jurisdiction: The provisions of this section shall apply to flood hazard areas within the Town. (Ord. 13-2018, 3-27-2018)
b. Basis For Establishing The Areas Of Special Flood Hazard: The areas of special flood hazard in the Town are identified by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency ("FEMA") in a scientific and engineering report entitled, "The Flood Insurance Study for Boulder County
Colorado and Incorporated Areas", dated December 18, 2012 and updated on August 15, 2019, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate
Maps (the "FIRM") and any letter of map revisions thereto, which are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this
section. If a scientific and engineering report based on updated conditions is available, and that report identifies additional areas of special
flood hazard, that report will be adopted by reference and made part of this section. The intent of this section is to use the most current and
updated data available. (Ord. 21-2019, 7-23-2019)
c. Effect Of Floodplain Regulations: The regulations of this section shall be construed as being supplementary to the regulations imposed on
the same lands by any underlying zoning district. This section supersedes provisions of any zoning relating to floodplain. Any underlying
zoning shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that its provisions are more restrictive than those of this section.
d. Interpretation: The interpretation and application of the provisions of this section shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be
liberally construed in favor of the Governing Body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by Colorado
Statutes.
e. Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability: The degree of flood protection intended to be provided by this section is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur upon occasion, or the
flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes, such as ice jams, and bridge openings restricted by debris. This section
does not imply that the areas outside the Floodway District and Floodway Fringe District boundaries or land uses permitted within such
districts will always be totally free from flooding or flood damage. This section shall not create liability on the part of the Town, any officer or
employee thereof, or the FEMA, for any flood damage that results from reliance on this section or any administrative decision lawfully
made hereunder.
f. Compliance With Provisions: No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted or altered without full

necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that:
(1) The criteria outlined in subsections C11a through C11j of this section are met, and
(2) The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threats to public safety.
D. Planned Unit Development Overlay District (PUD):
1. Purpose: The PUD Overlay District is generally used when there is special public interest that does not coincide with the traditional zoning in
a geographic area. The PUD Overlay District may only be used when an application is not able to meet the requirements of a standard zone
classification. The PUD is a mapped area with restrictions in addition to, or less than, those in the underlying traditional zone. Rather than
attempt to create a new zoning category, an overlay zone is superimposed over the traditional zone and establishes additional regulations, or
reduces or extends the existing uses. The underlying zoning identifies permitted land uses, the overlay zone may provide design restrictions,
additional setbacks, or other exceptions to the base district regulations.
General purposes of a PUD are as follows:
a. Establish a procedure for the development of larger parcels of land in order to reduce or eliminate the rigidity, delays, and inequities
that otherwise would result from application of zoning standards and procedures designed primarily for small parcels.
b. Ensure orderly and thorough planning and review procedures that will result in high-quality urban design.
c. Encourage variety and avoid monotony in large developments by allowing greater freedom in selecting the means to provide access,
light, open space, and amenity.
d. Provide a mechanism for considering mixes of uses that can be made compatible by application of careful and imaginative treatment
of interrelationships of activity.
e. Encourage allocation and improvement of common open space in residential areas, and provide for maintenance of the open space at
the expense of those who will directly benefit from it.
f. To convert land so poorly developed as to be a public liability.
g. Encourage the preservation of serviceable existing structures of historic value or artistic merit by providing the opportunity to use them
imaginatively for purposes other than that for which they were originally intended.
h. Encourage the assembly of properties that might otherwise be developed in unrelated increments to the detriment of surrounding
neighborhoods.
i. To simplify processing of development proposals for developers and the Planning Commission by providing for concurrent review of
land use, subdivision, public improvements and siting considerations.
2. District-Specific Standards: In any PUD development, although it is permissible to depart from literal conformance with the individual-lot
dimension and area regulations, there shall be no variation of:
a. The underlying zone district's maximum density requirements;
b. Height requirements, except in the RC District;
c. Parking requirements;
d. Loading and unloading area requirements;
e. Public street and alley standards;
f. Exterior lighting standards;
g. Operational standards;
h. Parks, open space and trails dedication requirements;
i. Natural and scenic resource protection requirements;
j. Abandoned mine requirements;
k. Oil and gas wells and production facility requirements;
l. Floodplain protection; and
m. Stormwater requirements.

The Planning Commission shall attach reasonable standards to insure that there shall not be a departure from the intent of this UDC. The
PUD development shall conform to such standards. Because a PUD development is inherently more complex than individual-lot
development and because each such project must be tailored to the topography and neighboring uses, the standards for such projects
cannot be inflexible.
a. Development along the perimeter of the PUD shall adhere to all required setbacks of the underlying zoning.
b. Access points to all arterial streets shall be located no more frequently than once every one-eighth (1/8) to a quarter of a mile. The
Planning Commission may approve the location of temporary access points.
c. Wherever there is an abrupt change in uses - i.e., residential to commercial - a buffer area of open space, protective planting, or other
approved screening, or combination thereof shall be placed between them which will protect each use from the undesirable effects of the
other.
The review procedures contained in section 10-7-6 of this title, shall apply to all development in a PUD Overlay District. (Ord. 13-2018, 3-27-2018)
Chapter 3
USE REGULATIONS
10-3-1: TABLE OF PERMITTED USES:
Subsection E, table 3-1 of this section lists the principal uses permitted within all standard zoning districts. For the PD District, unless expressly
modified in the PD Development Plan, shall be as specified in subsection E, table 3-1 of this section for the appropriate land use category. Each of
the listed uses is defined in chapter 11 of this title.
A. Explanation Of Table Abbreviations:
1. Permitted Uses: "P" in a cell indicates that the use is permitted by right, without special conditions other than those imposed upon other uses
by right in the district. Permitted uses are subject to all other applicable regulations of this UDC, including the use-specific standards set forth
in this chapter and the requirements of chapter 6 of this title.
2. Special Review Uses: "S" in a cell indicates that, in the respective zoning district, the use is permitted only if reviewed and approved as a
special review use in accordance with the procedures of section 10-7-13 of this title. Special review uses are subject to all other applicable
regulations of this UDC, including the use-specific standards set forth in this chapter and the requirements of chapter 6 of this title.
3. Prohibited Uses: A blank cell indicates that the use is prohibited in the respective zoning district.
4. Use-Specific Standards: Regardless of whether a use is permitted by right or permitted as a special review use, there may be additional
standards that are applicable to the use. Use-specific standards are noted through a cross-reference in the last column of the table. Crossreferences
refer to section 10-3-2 of this chapter. These standards apply in all districts unless otherwise specified.
B. Table Organization: In subsection E, table 3-1 of this section, land uses and activities are classified under a "primary use classification" (such as
residential or commercial) and then into specific "use types" based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics, such as the type
and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered, and site conditions. This classification
provides a systematic basis for assigning present and future land uses into appropriate zoning districts. This classification does not list every
use or activity that may appropriately exist within the categories and specific uses may be listed in one category when they may reasonably
have been listed in one or more other categories. The use categories are intended merely as an indexing tool and are not regulatory.
C. Use For Other Purposes Prohibited: Approval of a use listed in subsection E, table 3-1 of this section, and compliance with the applicable usespecific
standards for that use, authorizes that use only. Development or use of a property for any other use not specifically permitted in
subsection E, table 3-1 of this section, and approved under the appropriate process is prohibited, unless otherwise permitted as noted below.
D. Classification Of New And Unlisted Uses: Notwithstanding the prohibition stated in subsection C of this section, new types of land use will
develop and forms of land use not anticipated may seek to locate in the Town. In order to provide for such situations, a determination as to the
appropriate classification of any new or unlisted form of land use shall be made. When application is made for a use category or use type that
is not specifically listed in subsection E, table 3-1 of this section, the procedure set forth below shall be followed.
1. The Community Development Director shall provide an interpretation as to the zoning classification into which such use should be placed. In
making such interpretation, the Community Development Director shall consider its potential impacts, including but not limited to: the nature
of the use and whether it involves dwelling unit activity; sales; processing; type of product, storage and amount, and nature thereof; enclosed
or open storage; anticipated employment; transportation requirements; the amount of noise, odor, fumes, dust, toxic material, and vibration
likely to be generated; and the general requirements for public utilities such as water and sanitary sewer.
2. Standards for new and unlisted uses may be interpreted as those of a similar use by the Community Development Director.
3. Appeal of the Community Development Director's decision shall be made to the Board of Adjustment following procedures under subsection
10-7-22A of this title.

a. Required Setbacks: Setbacks shall be unoccupied and unobstructed by any structure or portion of a structure from thirty inches (30")
above grade upward; provided, however, that fences, walls, trellises, poles, posts, ornaments, furniture and other customary yard
accessories may be permitted in any setback subject to height limitations and requirements limiting obstruction of visibility.
(1) A building, structure, or lot shall not be developed, used, or occupied unless it meets the minimum setback requirements set forth in
subsection 10-4-1A, table 4-1 of this chapter for the zoning district in which it is located, except as otherwise established in this UDC or
unless a variance has been granted.
(2) A setback or other open space required by this UDC shall not be included as part of a setback or other open space required by this
UDC for another building or structure or lot.
b. Projections Into Required Setbacks, General: The following structures may project into required front, side or rear setbacks as specified in
this subsection:
(1) Paved Patios Or Terraces: Paved patios or terraces may project into any required setback, provided that no structures placed on them
shall violate other requirements of this UDC.
(2) Unroofed Landings, Decks And Stairs: Unroofed landings, decks and stairs may project into required setbacks, provided that the floor
shall not extend higher than thirty inches (30") above the finished grade level and the projection is at least five feet (5') from the lot line.
(3) Unroofed Exterior Balconies: Unroofed exterior balconies may project into a required side or rear setback provided these projections
are at least five feet (5') from the side lot line and ten feet (10') from the rear lot line.
(4) Incidental Architectural Features: Cornices, eaves, canopies, window wells, chimneys, bay windows, ornamental features, and other
similar architectural features may project not more than two feet (2') into any required setback provided these projections are at least five
feet (5') from the lot line.
(5) Roofs Over Porches And Other Exterior Approaches: Roofs over porches, stairways, landings, terraces, or other exterior approaches to
pedestrian doorways may project up to six feet (6') into a front setback, provided that the roof projections shall comprise no more than
fifty percent (50%) of the total length of the building's facade. The covered porch or entrance area projecting into the front setback shall
remain exterior to the building and enclosed by no more than a railing. The projection shall be at least five feet (5') from the property line.
(6) Handicap Ramps: The Community Development Director may allow the installation of handicap access ramps in required front, side,
and rear setbacks. The design and placement of the ramps shall be reviewed to ensure that:
(A) The ramp has minimal visual impact on abutting properties;
(B) The width of the ramp does not exceed forty eight inches (48").
(7) Private Garages And Carports: A private garage or carport may project into a required setback abutting an alley, provided the projection
is at least five feet (5') from the property line. A second story living space shall be permitted above the private garage. The private
garage or carport shall be subject to the other requirements of this UDC.
(8) Fences And Walls: Fences and walls may project into any required setback and shall be in accordance with other requirements of this
UDC.
c. Projections Into Easement And Right-Of-Ways Prohibited: Projections shall not extend or encroach into any easement(s) or right(s)-of-way.
d. Contextual Front Setbacks: In addition to permitted projections described in subsection A1b of this section, the following exceptions to the
front setback requirement for dwellings abutting local streets (not collector or arterial streets) are authorized for a lot in any district.
(1) If there are dwelling units on both abutting lots with front setbacks of less than the required depth for the district, the front setback for
the lot need not exceed the average front yard of the abutting dwelling units.
(2) If there is a dwelling unit on one abutting lot with a front setback of less than the required depth for the district, the front setback for the
lot need not exceed a depth one-half (1/2) way between the depth of the abutting lot and the required setback depth.
e. Corner Lots: In the case of corner lots, unless the prevailing front setback pattern on adjoining lots indicates otherwise, front setbacks shall
be provided on all frontages. Where one of the front setbacks that would normally be required on a through lot is not in keeping with the
prevailing setback pattern, the Community Development Director may waive the requirement for the normal front setback and substitute
therefor a special front setback requirement, which shall not exceed the average of the setbacks provided on adjacent lots.
f. Corner Sight Distance (A.K.A. Sight Or Vision Clearance Triangle): Where a driveway or private street intersects a public right-of-way or
where property abuts the intersection of two (2) public right-of-ways, unobstructed sight distance as described in the Town of Erie
Standards and Specifications for Design and Construction of Public Improvements, shall be maintained at all times within the sight triangle

DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN STANDARDS
10-6-1: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
A. Purpose: The standards in this chapter apply to the physical layout and design of development in the Town. These provisions address the
physical relationship between development and adjacent properties, public streets, neighborhoods, and the natural environment. The general
intent is to implement the Town's Comprehensive Master Plan vision of an attractive, efficient, and livable community that features stable
neighborhoods and promotes a mix of uses in well-designed community focal points. The specific purposes of this chapter include:
1. To encourage the proper use of the land by promoting an appropriate balance between the built environment and the preservation and
protection of open space and natural resources;
2. To protect public and private investment through preservation of open spaces, protection of natural resources including existing trees,
providing buffers between incompatible uses and along roadways, and encouraging the planting of new trees and vegetation as deemed
appropriate;
3. To promote sound management of water quality and quantity through preservation of natural areas and by encouraging the use of native
plant materials;
4. To provide appropriate standards to ensure a high quality appearance for the Town and promote good design while also allowing flexibility,
individuality, creativity, and artistic expression;
5. To strengthen and protect the image, identity, and unique character of the Town and thereby to enhance its business economy;
6. To encourage high quality retail commercial businesses that provide positive sustainable revenue sources to the Town;

three inches (3") or greater for ornamental trees and eight feet (8') high or greater for evergreen trees shall be preserved to the maximum
extent reasonably practicable. Healthy trees that meet the size requirement shall be replaced by trees of no less than two inch (2") caliper,
with the total gross caliper inches of the replacement trees being one and one-half (11/2) times greater than the total caliper inches of
those trees removed. This requirement shall not prevent the removal of unhealthy trees in conjunction with site development. Any required
replacement tree shall not be planted within an area such that the mature canopy of the tree will interfere with overhead utility lines, or that
the mature root zone of the tree interferes with underground public utility lines. Trees required to be added per the landscaping
requirements in section 10-6-4 of this chapter or by virtue of deed restrictions shall not be considered as replacement trees. If a property
cannot physically meet the tree replacement requirement then at the Town's discretion, a fee-in-lieu payment may be considered by the
Town. Final approval shall be with the entity identified for final approval of the application. The fee-in-lieu payment will be equal to the
Town's tree impact fee and the fee-in-lieu received will be deposited by the Town into that Impact Fee Fund.
b. Tree Protection Before And During Construction: Before construction activities commence on the site, the following protection measures
shall be observed in order to protect all trees that are not going to be removed. The protection measures shall be maintained until
construction activities around the protected trees are complete.

as driveway, walks, etc., shall be flagged with bright fluorescent orange vinyl tape wrapped around the main trunk at a height of four feet
(4') or more such that the tape is visible to workers operating construction equipment. This shall not include the flagging of all protected
trees adjacent to right-of-way within approved residential subdivisions during the construction of the roadway.
(B) Open Space Flagging: All trees or groups of trees within areas intended to be saved as open space shall be enclosed with
fluorescent orange tape along all areas of possible access or intrusion by construction equipment. Tape shall be supported at a
maximum of twenty five foot (25') intervals by wrapping trees or by other approved methods. Single incident access for the purposes of
clearing underbrush is permitted.
(C) Protective Fencing: Protective fencing shall be located at the drip lines of all protected trees that border the limits of construction. In
situations where a protected tree is located within the immediate area of intended construction, protective fencing will be located at the
drip line.
(2) Permanent Construction Methods:
(A) Boring: Boring of utilities under protected trees may be required in certain circumstances. When required, the length of the bore shall
be the width of the critical root zone at a minimum and shall be a minimum depth of forty eight inches (48").
(B) Trenching: All trenching where possible shall be designed to avoid trenching across the critical root zone of any protected tree. This
shall not inhibit the placement of necessary underground services such as electric, telephone, or gas.
(C) Root Pruning: It is recommended that all roots two inches (2") or larger in diameter which are exposed as a result of trenching or
other excavation be cut off square with a sharp medium tooth saw and covered with pruning compound within two (2) hours of initial
exposure.
(3) Issuance Of Permit; Conditions: No grading permit, public improvement permit, or building permit shall be issued unless the applicant
signs an application or permit request which states that all construction activities shall meet the requirements of this subsection. The
chief building official shall make available to the applicant a copy of this section.
c. Prohibited Activities: The following activities shall be prohibited within the limits of the critical root zone of any protected tree:
(1) Material Storage: No materials intended for use in construction or waste materials accumulated due to excavation or demolition shall be
placed within the limits of the critical root zone of any protected tree.
(2) Equipment Cleaning; Liquid Disposal: No equipment shall be cleaned or other liquids deposited or permitted to flow overland within the
limits of the critical root zone of a protected tree. This would include paint, oil, solvents, asphalt, concrete, mortar, or similar materials.
(3) Tree Attachments: No signs, wires, or other attachments, other than those of a protective nature, shall be attached to any protected
tree.
(4) Vehicular Traffic: No vehicular or construction equipment traffic or parking shall take place within the limits of the critical root zone of
any protected tree other than on an existing street pavement. This subsection does not apply to single incident access within a critical
root zone for purposes of clearing underbrush, establishing the building pad and associated lot grading, vehicular traffic necessary for
routine utility maintenance or emergency restoration of utility service or routine mowing operations.
(5) Grade Changes: No grade changes (cut or fill) shall be permitted within the limits of the critical root zone of any protected tree unless
adequate construction methods are approved by the Community Development Director.
(6) Impervious Paving: No paving with asphalt, concrete or other impervious materials in a manner which may reasonably be expected to
kill a tree shall be placed within the limits of the critical root zone of a protected tree.
7. Tree Pruning:
a. Generally:
(1) Preserved trees shall be pruned to remove dead or hazardous branches to ensure the health of the tree and safety of the public.
(2) No protected tree shall be pruned in such a manner that significantly disfigures the tree or in a manner that would reasonably lead to
the death of a tree, except where such pruning is necessary for safety.
b. Pruning Standards: All pruning shall be in accordance with the National Arborist Association Standards for Pruning of Shade Trees.
8. Maintenance Or Replacement: All trees shall be placed on a permanent irrigation system. For the construction phase of the development,
the applicant may propose an alternative method of watering until the permanent irrigation system is installed.
If any of the trees required to be retained or trees planted as a part of this section should die within a period of two (2) years after completion
of the activities associated with construction, the owner of the property shall replace the trees within six (6) months. Trees that are removed
shall be replaced by trees of no less than two inch (2") caliper for deciduous, one and one-half (11/2) for ornamental and eight feet (8') for
evergreen, with the total gross caliper inches of the replacement trees being equal to or greater than the total caliper inches of those trees
removed.
9. Incentive For Additional Tree Protection: Applicants are strongly encouraged to save as much existing vegetation and tree cover on a
development site as possible. A five percent (5%) to twenty percent (20%) reduction in the number of parking spaces required on the site
may be granted for preservation of additional tree cover beyond that required by this section, so that the reduction in the amount of required
pavement can help preserve existing healthy trees in an undisturbed, natural condition. The amount of reduction can be determined only
10/28/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 314/449

10-6-3: PARKS, OPEN SPACE, AND TRAILS:
A. Purpose: This section is intended to regulate the planning, development, construction, preservation, and maintenance of parks, open space,
and trails throughout the Town. Parks, open space, and trail regulations are intended to preserve natural areas and resources, preserve scenic
views, provide access to open areas and recreational opportunities, create public health benefits, and generally enhance the quality of life for
residents. Particular emphasis should be placed on providing a diversity of parks, trails, and open space opportunities that serve residents of all
ages and abilities and that are accessible from a variety of locations within the community.
B. Park Land Dedication, Park Construction And Neighborhood Park Land And Construction Cost Fee:
1. Purpose: This section is intended to provide lands and construction of neighborhood parks or the neighborhood park land and construction
cost fee for park demand generated by new residential subdivisions. In general, the dedicated lands shall be suitable for the development of
neighborhood parks. Where no suitable land is available or is required by the Town, based on subsection B4 of this section, a neighborhood
park land and construction cost fee may be substituted at the Town's discretion.
2. Applicability: Any person offering a preliminary or final plat for development of any area zoned and to be used for residential purposes in the
Town shall be required to dedicate: a) a portion of land toward a community goal of 8.5 acres of park land per one thousand (1,000)
residents; or b) pay the neighborhood park land and construction cost fee pursuant to subsection B7 of this section.
3. Amount Of Park Land To Be Dedicated:
a. The amount of park land dedicated shall not be less than 8.5 acres of park land per one thousand (1,000) residents of the development
unless the Board of Trustees makes an individualized finding that supports an alternate dedication requirement. Any such alternate
dedication requirement shall be reasonably related to the impacts upon the Town's parks and recreation system that will be generated by
the residents and users of the subject development. The following formula shall be used for determining the amount of land to be
dedicated:
8.5 acres X (number of dwelling units) X (persons per dwelling unit)
= area to be dedicated
1,000
b. The distribution of this land should generally be as follows:
(1) Pocket parks: 0.5 acres per one thousand (1,000) residents.
(2) Neighborhood parks: Three (3) acres per one thousand (1,000) residents.
10/28/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 316/449
(3) Community parks: Five (5) acres per one thousand (1,000) residents.
The Board of Trustees shall have discretion to re-allocate acreage within the above categories for the benefit of the community.
c. The Community Development Director shall determine the number of persons per dwelling unit based upon data compiled by the Town
from time-to-time, which shall be reviewed and adjusted by the Board of Trustees as necessary to reflect current figures.
d. The developer shall submit with each subdivision plat for multi-family residential development information concerning the number of
dwelling units. Should the developer fail to do so, the Community Development Department shall assume the highest density permitted in
such Multi-Family Residential District.

b. Additional Criteria For Park Land Dedications: Except as otherwise required by the Planning Commission at the time of preliminary plat
approval or by the Board of Trustees on acceptance of the dedication, all dedications of land under this section shall meet the following
criteria. These criteria should be considered general guidelines to ensure that dedicated land is suitable for park development.
(1) Aggregate Parcel: The dedicated park land shall form a single parcel of land, except where the Board of Trustees determines that two
(2) or more parcels would be in the best interest of the public, given the type and distribution of open spaces needed to adequately serve
the proposed development. In such cases, the Board of Trustees may require that such parcels be connected by a dedicated strip of
land at least thirty feet (30') in width.
(2) Usability: At least seventy five percent (75%) of the dedicated land required by this section shall be well-drained, level, and suitable for
playing fields and recreational facilities. No part of such seventy five percent (75%) shall be within any designated floodplain or floodway
of the Town.
(3) Connectivity: All dedicated land shall, to the maximum extent reasonably feasible, be linked to parks, open space, and trails or adjacent
parcels to form a connected system throughout the Town.
(4) Environmental Considerations: All parks should be located, designed, constructed, and maintained to minimize local, regional, and
global environmental impacts as provided in the Town's Comprehensive Master Plan.

(D) Streetscape or landscape buffers and median strips;
(E) Major utility easements over thirty feet (30') wide;
(F) Oil and gas well sites and setbacks;
(G) Stormwater detention and water quality ponds greater than five feet (5') deep with slopes greater than 5:1;
(H) Mine shafts and associated setbacks; and
(I) Irrigation ditches and stormwater channels.
5. Procedure For Dedication Of Park Land: The dedication of park land shall be reviewed and approved as part of the preliminary plat. The
developer shall designate on the preliminary plat and final plat the area or areas of land to be dedicated pursuant to this section.
6. Submission Of Deed And Title: Unless otherwise stipulated in a development agreement, the conveyance of dedicated land to the Town shall
be by warranty deed, and the title shall be free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, including Real Property Taxes prorated to the time of
conveyance. The owner shall provide the Town with title insurance for the property. The deed shall be submitted no later than thirty (30) days
after the approval of a final plat, or as directed by the Town.
7. Payments Of Neighborhood Park Land And Development Construction Cost Fee:
a. Applicability:
(1) In the event a developer of a development would not be required to dedicate and construct a neighborhood park pursuant to the terms
of this section, the Town in its discretion may instead require the developer to pay the neighborhood park land and construction cost fee
pursuant to this subsection.
(2) When an area greater than seven (7) acres is required to be dedicated in a part of Town that already has sufficient park land (as
specified in the Town of Erie Comprehensive Master Plan and the Town of Erie Parks, Recreation, Trails and Open Space Master Plan),
the Planning Commission or Board of Trustees shall have the right to require payment of the neighborhood park land and construction
cost fee rather than require a land dedication and construction of the park, in the interests of the public health, safety and welfare.
10/28/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 318/449
(3) Redevelopment of properties that previously dedicated land, constructed a park, paid fees in lieu, or paid the neighborhood park land
and construction cost fee are exempt from paying an additional neighborhood park land and construction cost fee or making additional
land dedication.
b. Payment Into Parks Capital Fund: In instances where payment of a neighborhood park land and construction cost fee is to be made in
place of a required land dedication and park construction, the neighborhood park land and construction cost fee shall be paid into a Town
Parks Capital Fund. The neighborhood park land and construction cost fee payment shall be set forth in title 2, chapter 10 of the Town
Code, and may be adjusted from time to time as necessary. The neighborhood park land and construction cost fee payment by the
developer shall be made prior to the recordation of the final plat.
c. Administration Of Parks Capital Fund: The Parks Capital Fund will be administered by the Town to provide a demonstrable benefit to
contributing developments, provided that the establishment of all public parks shall be within the discretion of the Board of Trustees. The
money paid by the developer will be expended exclusively to establish and construct park land that generally benefits the proposed
development. The money shall be properly expended by the Town or returned to the developer within seven (7) years of the date of final
plat recordation, unless there is a planned use for the funds through appropriation, the Town's 5-year capital improvement plan or other
long-range capital planning process. The Town shall account for all money deposited to the fund, which may be expended for such
purposes as acquisition of land, construction of improvements, and purchase of equipment for the relevant park.
C. Open Space And Trail Dedications And Fees In-Lieu:
1. Intent: Broad views and rolling agricultural lands are abundant and contribute significantly to the Town's character; however, many of these
lands are planned for future development in the Town's Comprehensive Master Plan. In addition to providing land for trails, open space can
help direct growth, maintain rural character, protect sensitive environmental areas, scenic views and historic resources, and provide
opportunities for education, wildlife protection and observation, hiking, and other passive and active recreation activities for existing and
future Town residents.
2. Applicability: Any person filing a preliminary or final plat for development of any area zoned and to be used for single-family, duplex, or multifamily
residential purposes in the Town shall be required to dedicate: a) a portion of land toward a community goal of seventeen (17) acres of
open space per one thousand (1,000) residents; or b) pay an in-lieu fee pursuant to subsection C6 of this section.
3. Amount Of Open Space To Be Dedicated:
a. The amount of open space to be dedicated shall not be less than seventeen (17) acres of open space land per one thousand (1,000)
ultimate residents of the development unless the Board of Trustees makes an individualized finding that supports an alternate dedication
requirement. Any such alternate dedication requirement shall be reasonably related to the impacts upon the Town's parks and recreation
system that will be generated by the residents and users of the subject development. The following formula shall be used for determining
the amount of land to be dedicated:
17 acres X (number of dwelling units) X (persons per dwelling unit)
= area to be dedicated
1,000
b. The Community Development Director shall determine the number of persons per dwelling unit based upon data compiled by the Town
from time-to-time in the update of its comprehensive master plans, which shall be reviewed and adjusted by the Board of Trustees as
necessary to reflect current figures.
c. The developer shall submit with each subdivision plat for multi-family residential development information concerning the number of
dwelling units. Should the developer fail to do so, the Community Development Department shall assume the highest density permitted in

agricultural state. Open space land shall have the following characteristics:
(1) A minimum of ten (10) contiguous acres;
(2) A parcel that is no less than three hundred feet (300') at the narrowest width, unless the Town approves a lesser amount for a trail;
(3) To the maximum extent reasonably feasible, a location that is contiguous with or connected to adjacent open space or parks;
(4) Is, generally, unencumbered by utility lines, built structures, and paved surfaces;
(5) If the Town has not approved the open space dedication for agricultural purposes, then the property shall be covered with native
vegetation and generally free of weeds and other noxious plants and trees. If land being dedicated is not in a native condition acceptable
to the Town, then applicant shall be responsible for restoration of the property to native vegetation before the Town accepts it for
maintenance; and
(6) Typically, open space shall be owned and maintained by the Town. The Town may consider a conservation easement as an alternative.
Approval of a conservation easement shall be at the discretion of the Town approving body.

c. Resource Preservation: To the maximum extent reasonably feasible, where significant natural and scenic resource assets exist on a
property, the subdivider, developer, or owner shall give priority to their preservation as open space. In reviewing the proposed location of
open space areas, the Community Development Director shall use all applicable plans, maps, and reports to determine whether significant
resources exist on a proposed site that should be protected, with priority being given to the following areas (which are not listed in a
particular order):
(1) Flood hazard areas;
(2) Lakes, rivers, creeks, wetlands, stream/riparian corridors, and similar features;
(3) Wildlife habitat and migration corridors; and
(4) Native and specimen trees and plants.

provide the Town with title insurance for the property. The deed shall be submitted no later than thirty (30) days after the approval of a final
plat.
6. Payments Of Fees In-Lieu Of Land Dedication:
a. Applicability:
(1) Development of an area smaller than five (5) acres for open space purposes usually is impractical from the Town's perspective. If a
development would be required under this section to dedicate less than five (5) acres as open space, the Town in its discretion may
require the developer to pay cash in-lieu of land pursuant to this subsection.
(2) When an area greater than five (5) acres is required to be dedicated in a part of Town that already has sufficient open space (as
specified in the Town of Erie Comprehensive Master Plan and the Town of Erie Parks, Recreation, Open Space and Trails Master Plan),
the Board of Trustees shall have the right to require payment of cash in-lieu of land dedication in the interests of the public health, safety
and welfare.
b. Payment Into Trails And Natural Areas Fund: In instances where payment of fee is to be made in-lieu of land dedication, the fee-in-lieu of
land shall be paid into the Trails and Natural Areas Fund. The fee-in-lieu payment shall be set forth in title 2, chapter 10 of the Town Code,
and may be adjusted from time to time as necessary. The open space dedication payment by the developer shall be made prior to the
recordation of the final plat.
c. Administration Of Trails And Natural Areas Fund: The Trails and Natural Areas Fund shall be administered by the Town to provide a
demonstrable benefit to contributing developments, provided that the establishment of all public open space or trail systems shall be within

Property Taxes are collected.
G. Screening:
1. Purpose: Screening consists of landscaping, the retention of natural vegetation, or the use of physical structures to block views of specific
activities or specific parts of a property or structure. Applicants are encouraged to locate the types of features listed in this section where they
are not visible from off-site or public areas of a site, so that screening is unnecessary.
2. Applicability: Unless otherwise excepted in subsection B of this section, all uses shall be required to provide screening as specified in this
section to block the views of the specified features from any adjacent street or public open space or any adjacent property or public areas of
a site. Public areas of a site include parking lots, sales areas, outside eating areas, or other areas to which customers, clients, and guests
are given regular access.
3. Outdoor Refuse/Recycling Collection And Donation Bin Facilities: For purposes of this section, the term "refuse/recycling collection
receptacles" includes dumpsters, garbage cans, trash compactors, recycling receptacles, donation bins, debris piles, or grease containers,
but does not include trash or recycling receptacles for pedestrians or for temporary construction sites. This section also does not apply to
refuse collection receptacles such as garbage cans and recycling receptacles that are stored indoors and brought outdoors on garbage
pickup days.
In order to reduce the visual impacts of outdoor refuse/recycling collection receptacles, and to avoid problems with blown trash and pests, all
outdoor refuse/recycling collection receptacles shall adhere to the following standards:
a. Location: Outdoor refuse/recycling collection receptacles shall not be located in a required front setback, and should, depending on the
size of the site and need for access by refuse/recycling collection vehicles, be set back from the front plane of the principal structure.
Refuse/recycling collection receptacles shall not be located in any setback area or required landscaping area which abuts an adjacent
residential use. Refuse/recycling collection receptacles shall not be located within any area used to meet the minimum landscaping or
parking and loading area requirements of this UDC, or be located in a manner that obstructs or interferes with any designated vehicular or
pedestrian circulation routes onsite.
b. Screening Enclosure: All outdoor refuse/recycling collection receptacles, other than those used by single-family dwelling units, shall be
screened from view on all sides by a durable sight-obscuring enclosure consisting of a solid fence or wall six feet (6') in height that
matches the building materials of the principal building that it serves. The access shall be screened with an opaque gate six feet (6') in
height. Donation bins are not required to provide screening for the public access areas of the facility. The enclosure shall be maintained in
working order, and remain closed except during deposits and pick-ups.
c. Maintenance Of Refuse/Recycling Collection Receptacles And Screening Enclosures: Lids are required on all outdoor refuse/recycling
collection receptacles in screening enclosures without roof structures. Lids shall remain closed between pick-ups, and shall be maintained
in working order. Screening enclosures and gates shall be kept in good repair.
4. Service And Off-Street Loading Areas: Service and off-street loading areas shall be designed and located to reduce the visual and acoustic
impacts of these functions on adjacent properties and public streets. Non-enclosed service and off-street loading areas adjacent to
residential properties and public streets shall be screened with opaque materials that are an integral part of the building architecture,
including, durable, sight-obscuring walls and/or fences six feet (6') in height. Screening materials shall be the same as, or of equal quality to,
the materials used for the primary building. Landscaping shall also be incorporated to aid in screening the non-enclosed service and offstreet
loading areas and softening the appearance of the screening wall or fence.
5. Drive Through Service And Stacking Drives: Drive through service areas and stacking drives shall be designed and located to reduce the
potential visual and acoustic impacts of these functions on adjacent residential property, public streets, and primary internal drive circulation
routes in a multi-building complex.
a. Drive through service ordering and pick-up window areas shall not be orientated toward residential property, arterial streets, and collector
streets.
b. The minimum landscape setback to drive through service areas and stacking drives from streets, and primary internal drive circulation
routes in a multi-building complex shall be ten feet (10').
6. Rooftop Mechanical Equipment: Rooftop mechanical equipment, including HVAC equipment and utility equipment that serves the structure,
shall be screened. Screening shall be accomplished through the use of parapet walls or a sight-obscuring enclosure around the equipment
constructed of one of the primary materials used on the primary facades of the structure, and that is an integral part of the building's
architectural design. The parapet or screen shall completely surround the rooftop mechanical equipment to an elevation equal to or greater
than the highest portion of the rooftop mechanical equipment being screened. In the event such parapet wall does not fully screen all rooftop
10/28/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 325/449
equipment, then the rooftop equipment shall be enclosed by a screen constructed of one of the primary materials used on the primary facade
of the building so as to achieve complete screening.
7. Wall-Mounted Mechanical Equipment And Meters: Wall-mounted mechanical equipment should not be placed on the front facade of a
building or on a facade that faces a right-of-way to the maximum extent reasonably practicable. Wall-mounted mechanical equipment,
including air conditioning or HVAC equipment and groups of multiple utility meters, that extends six inches (6") or more from the outer
building wall shall be screened from view from streets; from residential, public, and institutional properties; and from public areas of the site
or adjacent sites through the use of: a) sight-obscuring enclosures constructed of one of the primary materials used on the primary facade of
the structure, b) sight-obscuring fences, or c) trees or shrubs that block at least eighty percent (80%) of the equipment from view. Wallmounted
mechanical equipment that extends six inches (6") or less from the outer building wall shall be designed to blend in with the color
and architectural design of the subject building.
8. Outdoor Storage: In no case shall the storage or parking of trailers, semi-trailers, cargo containers or shipping containers outdoors, or the
warehousing of goods in such containers, be permitted as a principal use. Outdoor storage may be permitted as an accessory use through
the site plan review process described in section 10-7-12 of this title. The storage area shall meet all of the following requirements as well as
design criteria found in subsection G10 of this section:
a. Each outdoor storage area shall be screened from view from all property lines and adjacent right-of-ways by an opaque fence or wall
between six feet (6') and eight feet (8') in height that incorporates at least one of the predominant materials and one of the predominant
colors used in the primary structure. The fence may exceed eight feet (8') in height where the difference in grade between the right-of-way
and the outdoor storage area makes a taller fence necessary to effectively screen the area. Materials may not be stored higher than the
height of the primary structure. The perimeter of the fence or wall must be landscaped with a seven foot (7') wide strip containing a
minimum of one tree for every one hundred fifty (150) square feet of lot area.
b. A landscaped earth berm may be used instead of or in combination with a required fence or wall. The total height of the screening,
including fence and berming, shall not exceed the maximum fencing height requirement.

a. Within one hundred feet (100') of the intersection of two (2) public streets to the maximum extent reasonably practicable as determined by
the Community Development Director. The one hundred foot (100') setback shall be measured from the edge of the street right-of-way.
When this standard is deemed impracticable an alternative placement shall be reviewed and determined by the Community Development
Director.
b. In any parkway or public street medians.
c. On any sidewalk.
10. Non-Residential Outdoor Storage:
a. Each outdoor storage area shall be screened from view from all property lines and adjacent right-of-ways by a solid fence or wall between
six feet (6') and eight feet (8') in height. The fence shall meet the following standards:
(1) The fence shall incorporate at least one of the predominant materials and one of the predominant colors used in the primary structure.
However, the fencing material shall not be metal.
(2) The fence may exceed eight feet (8') in height where the difference in grade between the right-of-way and the outdoor storage area
makes a taller fence necessary to effectively screen the area. Approval for fencing that exceeds eight feet (8') in height shall be at the
discretion of the final decision maker for the application.
(3) Fencing of outdoor storage, adjacent to a public right-of-way, park, trail or open space, shall provide visual interest by varying the fence
setback to the street and creating planting pockets. Uninterrupted lengths of fence should be limited to one hundred fifty feet (150')
without providing planting pockets. Planting pockets shall be a minimum of twelve feet (12') deep and a minimum of fifty feet (50') long
and be densely planted with shrubs and trees. Additionally 2 foot by 2 foot masonry columns shall be placed a minimum of every
seventy five feet (75') of fence length.

(3) Perimeter fencing shall include columns with a maximum spacing of fifty feet (50'). Individual columns shall be a minimum of 2 feet by 2
feet, with a minimum of one foot (1') projecting in front of the fence towards the street. Columns shall include a cap detail for visual
interest.
(4) A minimum eight foot (8') buffer shall be provided between the back of a sidewalk and a fence or wall. Landscaping, including trees,
shall be incorporated within the buffer to soften the appearance of the wall or fence.
(5) No more than seventy five percent (75%) of any street frontage shall be occupied by the fence or wall.

(6) The required twenty five percent (25%) openings in the fence or wall frontage shall serve to visually link intersecting streets, view
corridors into and out of the development, pedestrian entryways, and parks or open space. Fences or walls that have a surface area that
is not more than fifty percent (50%) opaque, hedges and screens composed of living plant material, or any land use with a wall or fence
lower than forty two inches (42"), may count toward the twenty five percent (25%) requirement.
(7) The maximum length of continuous, unbroken, and uninterrupted fence plane shall be one hundred fifty feet (150'). A break in the plane
of a fence or wall may be achieved by one of the following:
(A) A break in the length of the wall or fence that is at least fifty feet (50') long and at least eight feet (8') in depth;
(B) A change to a fence that is not more than fifty percent (50%) opaque, such as an open rail or wrought iron fence, that has planting
pockets a minimum of four feet (4') in depth and fifty feet (50') long;
(C) A non-fenced opening at minimum of fifty feet (50') in length.
(8) Fences or walls shall not exceed five feet (5') in height.
(9) When a primary entrance to the structure is oriented toward a perimeter street, the perimeter fencing along the street shall be limited to
fences or walls that are not more than fifty percent (50%) opaque and do not exceed four feet (4') in height. Fences or walls required to
screen parking are not subject to this requirement.
(10) A variety of landscaping shall be provided in combination with any of the above fencing options to incorporate seasonal color, plant
variety, and berming to break up the visual mass of walls and fences.
(11) Landscaped berms shall not be used in the Downtown or Old Town Districts. In all other districts, landscaped berms may be used in
lieu of fencing or walls, or in combination with fencing or walls shall meet the following standards:
(A) Berms shall incorporate the curvilinear characteristics of natural landforms and shall not exceed four feet (4') in height; and
(B) For visual relief, berms shall incorporate a variety of plantings.
10. Nonconforming Fences, Hedges And Walls: Nonconforming fences, hedges, and walls in existence on the effective date hereof may
continue to exist until such time as they are removed, or damaged such that the cost of repairs is greater than fifty percent (50%) of its value,
at which time the fence, hedge or wall must be brought into full compliance with this UDC. (Ord. 13-2018, 3-27-2018)
10-6-5: TRANSPORTATION AND ACCESS:
A. Purpose: The purpose of this section is to support the creation of a highly connected transportation system within the Town in order to provide
choices for drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians; increase effectiveness of Municipal service delivery; promote walking and bicycling; connect
neighborhoods to each other and to local destinations such as employment, schools, parks, and shopping centers; reduce vehicle miles of
travel and travel times; improve air quality; reduce emergency response times; mitigate the traffic impacts of new development, and free up
arterial capacity to better serve regional long-distance travel needs.
B. Applicability: The standards of this section shall apply to all new development and expansion of existing buildings except for development on a
single-family detached lot in an approved subdivision.
C. Traffic Impact Mitigation:
1. Applicability Of Traffic Impact Analysis Requirement: The transportation system for new development shall be capable of supporting the
proposed development in addition to the existing and future uses in the area. Evaluation of system capacity shall be undertaken through a
Traffic Impact Analysis (TIA), which should consider the following factors without limitation: street capacity and level of service; vehicle
access and loading; on-street parking impacts; the availability of transit service and connections to transit; impacts on adjacent
neighborhoods; and traffic safety including pedestrian safety. At a minimum, a TIA shall be required with applications for development review
and approval when:
a. Trip generation during any peak hour is expected to exceed two hundred fifty (250) trips per day or more than one hundred (100) trips
during any 1-hour peak period, based on traffic generation estimates of the Institute of Transportation Engineers' Trip Generation Manual
(or any successor publication);
b. A TIA is required by the Town, Planning Commission or Board of Trustees as a condition of any land use application approved pursuant to
the requirements of this UDC; and
c. The Community Development Director shall, unless deemed unnecessary through a waiver, also require a TIA for:
(1) Any project that proposes access to a street with level of service "D" or below;
(2) Any application for a rezoning, special review use, or site plan review;
(3) Any case where the previous TIA for the property is more than two (2) years old;
(4) Any case where increased land use intensity will result in increased traffic generation; and
(5) Any case in which the Community Development Director determines that a TIA should be required because of other traffic concerns
than may be affected by the proposed development.
10/28/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 329/449
2. Traffic Impact Analysis And Development Review Process:
a. A scoping meeting between the developer and the Community Development Director shall be required prior to the start of the TIA in order
to determine its parameters.
b. When access points are not defined or a site plan is not available at the time the TIA is prepared, additional studies may be required when
a site plan becomes available or the access points are defined.
3. Traffic Mitigation Measures: The applicant shall, as part of the TIA, recommend measures to minimize or mitigate the anticipated impacts
and determine the adequacy of the development's planned access points. Mitigation measures shall be acceptable to the Community
Development Director and may include, without limitation: an access management plan; transportation demand management measures;
street improvements on or off the site; placement of pedestrian, bicycle or transit facilities on or off the site; or other capital improvement
projects such as traffic calming infrastructure or capacity improvements.
D. Streets And On-Site Vehicular Circulation:
1. Street Standards: All streets shall meet the standards and requirements set forth in subsections 10-5-4G and H of this title, the Town
Transportation Plan and the Town-adopted Construction Standards.
2. Street Connectivity:
a. Purpose: Street and block patterns should include a clear hierarchy of well-connected streets that distribute traffic over multiple streets and
avoid traffic congestion on principal routes. Within each residential development, the access and circulation system should accommodate
the safe, efficient, and convenient movement of vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians through the development, and provide ample
opportunities for linking adjacent neighborhoods, properties, and land uses. Local neighborhood street systems are intended to provide
multiple direct connections to and between local destinations such as parks, schools, and shopping. These connections should knit
separate developments together, rather than forming barriers between them.
b. Vehicular Access To Public Streets: Any development of more than one hundred (100) residential dwelling units or additions to existing
developments such that the total number of dwelling units exceeds one hundred (100) shall be required to provide vehicular access to at
least four (4) public streets unless such provision is deemed impractical by the Community Development Director due to topography,
natural features, or the configuration of adjacent developments.
c. Connections To Vacant Land: Where new development is adjacent to land likely to be developed or redeveloped in the future, all streets,
bicycle paths, and access ways in the development's proposed street system shall continue through to the boundary lines of the area to
provide for the orderly subdivision of such adjacent land or the transportation and access needs of the community. In addition, all
redevelopment and street improvement projects shall take advantage of opportunities for retrofitting existing streets to provide increased
vehicular and pedestrian connectivity.
d. Access:
(1) All non-residential development shall be designed to allow for cross-access to adjacent properties to encourage shared parking and
shared access points on public or private streets. When cross-access is deemed impractical by the Community Development Director on
the basis of topography, the presence of natural features, or vehicular safety factors, this requirement may be waived provided that
appropriate bicycle and pedestrian connections are provided between adjacent developments or land uses. A cross access easement
shall be referenced as a note on a plat or be recorded prior to site plan approval for the development.
(2) Whenever feasible, there shall be no direct driveway access (ingress or egress) from any single-family residential lots to any nonresidential
collector street, arterial street or highway. Whenever feasible, all single-family residential lots shall have direct thoroughfare
access only from residential collector and local residential streets.
e. Cul-De-Sacs And Dead-End Streets: The use of dead end streets or cul-de-sacs should be minimized unless their use is required by site
constraints such as extreme topography or the preservation of natural features. Should they be incorporated, a view corridor, at the cul-desac
head, a minimum of thirty five feet (35') in width shall be provided to maintain open views and pedestrian access. View corridors shall
be created in a separate tract from buildable lots. View corridors shall contain a pedestrian walkway or trail connection whenever possible
unless deemed unfeasible by the Town. Width of the pedestrian walkway or trail connection shall be generally consistent with the Town of
Erie Comprehensive Master Plan and the Standards and Specification for Design and Construction of Public Improvements.
f. Neighborhood Circulation: Street connections shall connect neighborhoods to each other and to local destinations such as schools, parks,
greenbelt trail systems, and shopping centers, while minimizing neighborhood cut-through vehicle traffic movements that are non-local in
nature. Configuration of local and internal streets and traffic calming measures shall be used to discourage use of the local street system
for cut-through collector or arterial vehicular traffic.
g. Gated Communities Prohibited: Gated communities that feature entry guardhouses, gates across access routes, or similar features are
prohibited.
h. Multi-Family Residential Connectivity:
(1) Multi-family development sites greater than five (5) acres shall include a minimum of two (2) through-access drives. An exception may
be made in the circumstance where a site is landlocked by existing development or other physical constraints, or where existing natural
features on the site require the use of protective measures that would otherwise make a second access drive infeasible.
(2) Where head-in parking is provided along a public or private street, attached sidewalks may be used in lieu of detached sidewalks.
i. Residential Streets:
(1) Residential streets shall be laid out so that use by through-traffic will be discouraged. Traffic-calming techniques such as diverters,
neck-downs, street gardens, curvilinear alignments, etc., are encouraged to reduce speeds and cut-through traffic. Stop signs shall not
10/28/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 330/449
be used to regulate or calm speeds.
(2) Should topography or other constraints require the use of straight streets that extend more than six hundred feet (600') without being
punctuated by cross streets, an oblong median, traffic-calming device or similar feature shall be used to slow traffic and break-up the
"runway" appearance.
(3) To the maximum extent reasonably practicable, streets shall be arranged to follow the natural contours of the site.
3. Block Standards:
a. Purpose: Block standards are designed with the following intents:
(1) To help break-down the scale and size of developments into a series of smaller, more human-scale, and walkable blocks.
(2) To ensure that blocks are organized in terms of both their orientation and size in a manner that limits disturbance of a site's natural
features.
(3) To ensure that residential developments incorporate a well-defined pattern of blocks that provide frequent connections and serve as a
framework for a varied mix of residential uses.
b. General Design Considerations: Generally, blocks shall be designed subject to the following considerations:
(1) To provide for adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated.
(2) To accommodate the requirements of this UDC for lot sizes and dimensions.
(3) To create convenient access and control, and safety of vehicular and pedestrian traffic circulation, and emergency vehicles.
c. Maximum Block Lengths: In the Downtown and Old Town Residential Districts, the maximum block length between intersecting streets
shall be six hundred feet (600'). In all other districts, the maximum length of blocks between intersecting streets shall be one thousand five
hundred feet (1,500'). The average block face across each development site shall be a maximum of six hundred feet (600'). In cases
where physical barriers or property ownership creates conditions where it is appropriate that these standards be varied, the length may be
increased or decreased to meet the existing conditions having due regard for connecting streets, circulation of traffic, and public safety.
Such increases or decreases are subject to the review and recommendation of the Town staff.
E. Standards For Emergency Access:
1. Emergency access points, required by the Mountain View Fire Protection District, shall meet the following requirements:
a. The roadway must be able to support the weight of emergency apparatus.
b. The roadway must be a minimum of fifteen feet (15') wide and usually run in a fairly straight line.
c. The roadway must be comprised of an all-weather surface.
d. The roadway must be maintained and usable at all times during the year.
e. The point of entry must be signed as an "Emergency Access Point - Emergency Vehicles Only".
f. Any form of barricade shall be easily removed without a lot of effort, such as a barricade that can be laid down with a hydrant wrench.
F. Standards For Pedestrian Facilities:
1. Sidewalks:
a. All sidewalks shall be designed to comply with the Town's Standards and Specifications for Design and Construction of Public
Improvements.
b. Detached sidewalks shall be installed on both sides of all public streets.
c. Detached sidewalks shall be provided for all public and private streets within a multi-family development, and shall meet the following
standards:
(1) All sidewalks, as required above, shall be detached from the adjacent street and separated by a tree lawn that is a minimum of eight
feet (8') in width.
(2) Tree lawns shall be landscaped according to subsection 10-6-4E of this chapter.
d. When deemed appropriate by the Public Works Director and Community Development Director, pedestrian crossings shall be made safer
for pedestrians by one of the following: by shortening crosswalk distance with curb extensions, reducing sidewalk curb radii, and
eliminating free right-turn lanes. Signals that allow longer crossing times in Commercial and Mixed-Use Districts, mid-block crossings in
high-pedestrian use areas (if well-marked and traffic speeds are low), and medians shall be provided as appropriate.
2. On-Site Pedestrian Walkways:
a. Continuous Pedestrian Access: Pedestrian walkways shall form an on-site circulation system that minimizes conflict between pedestrians
and traffic at all points of pedestrian access to streets, on-site parking and building entrances.
10/28/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 331/449
b. On-Site Pedestrian Connections: Site plans shall orient to pedestrian access points and connections to surrounding street and trails
networks, to destinations such as schools or shopping, and to pedestrian linkage points on adjacent parcels, including building entrances,
transit stops, walkways, and signalized street crossings. On-site pedestrian walkways shall connect: 1) building entrances to one another
and 2) from building entrances to public sidewalk connections and existing or planned transit stops. If buildings are not placed directly
adjacent to the public sidewalk, then pedestrian walkways shall link the principal pedestrian site access to building entrances. All
developments that contain more than one building shall provide walkways between the principal entrances of the buildings.
c. Through-Block Connections: Within all developments, to the maximum extent reasonably practicable, pedestrian ways, crosswalks, or
multi-purpose trails no less than five feet (5') in width, located within a tract or easement a minimum of thirty feet (30') in width, shall be
constructed near the center and entirely through any block that is nine hundred feet (900') or more in length.
d. Cul-De-Sacs And Dead-End Streets: Where residential developments have cul-de-sacs or dead-end streets, such streets shall be
connected to the closest local or collector street or to cul-de-sacs in adjoining subdivisions via a sidewalk or multi-use path, except where
deemed impractical by the Community Development Director.
3. Trails:
a. Trails shall be located in general conformance with the Town's Comprehensive Master Plan, Parks, Recreation, Trails and Open Space
Master Plan and section 10-6-3 of this chapter.
b. Trails shall be constructed in conformance with the Parks, Recreation, Trails and Open Space Master Plan, the Standards and
Specifications for Design and Construction of Public Improvements and American With Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements.
c. Subdivisions shall provide trail connections to future adjacent development and existing adjacent trails.
d. The minimum width for a trail corridor shall be thirty feet (30').
e. If a trail is located on land not dedicated to the Town, a public access easement shall be granted by identification on the plat and by plat
note.
G. Standards For Bicycle Facilities:
1. Bicycle Parking: All development shall provide bicycle parking areas that comply with the following standards:
a. Location: Bicycle parking spaces shall be conveniently located, but in no case shall such facilities be located farther than one hundred
(100) linear feet from the primary building entrance.
b. Spaces Required: Bicycle parking spaces shall be provided at the following rates:
(1) A minimum of two (2) bicycle parking spaces or one bicycle parking space per twenty (20) off-street parking spaces for all commercial
and multi-family uses, whichever is greater.
(2) All other uses or combination of uses shall provide a minimum of two (2) bicycle parking spaces per building or one space per ten
thousand (10,000) square feet of building area, whichever is greater.
c. Securing Device: A rack or other structure shall be provided to secure parked bicycles.
2. Bicycle Lanes: Bicycle lanes are required in Town design standards for arterial and major collector streets. They are encouraged in the
design of local streets where low traffic speeds and volumes allow bicyclists and motorists to safely share the street. (Ord. 13-2018, 3-27-
2018)
10-6-6: OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING:
A. Purpose: This section is intended to provide for the location and design of off-street parking areas to accommodate motor vehicles, while
balancing the needs of pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit users. Parking areas are secondary and supportive to the primary land uses on the
site and parking lot design should reduce the prominence of these areas while emphasizing the primary facade and orienting pedestrians
toward the principal entranceways and walkways.
B. Applicability:
1. Generally:
a. The off-street parking and loading standards of this section shall apply to all parking lots and parking structures accessory to any new
building constructed and to any new or changed use in every district.
b. The requirements of this section shall apply to all temporary parking lots and parking lots that are the principal use on a site.
2. Expansions And Enlargements: The standards of this section shall apply when an existing structure or use is expanded or enlarged.
Additional off-street parking and loading spaces shall be required to serve the enlarged or expanded area, provided that in all cases the
number of off-street parking and loading spaces provided for the entire use (pre-existing plus expansion) must equal one hundred percent
(100%) of the minimum ratio established in this section.
C. Parking Lot Layout And Design Plan (10 Or More Spaces):
10/28/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 332/449
1. Applicability: For all proposed parking lots with ten (10) or more spaces, the applicant shall submit a parking lot layout and design plan for
review and approval by the Community Development Director. The plan shall contain sufficient detail to enable the Community Development
Director to verify compliance with this section. Subject to approval of the Community Development Director, the parking layout and design
plan may be combined with other plans required under this UDC, such as the landscaping plan required in section 10-6-4 of this chapter.
2. Minimum Plan Requirements:
a. The parking lot layout and design plan shall be prepared by a design professional such as a certified land use planner, landscape
architect, or registered architect. Such plans shall not be prepared by land surveyors unless they are an otherwise qualified design
professional.
b. All parking layout and design plans and site plans are subject to review and approval by the Community Development Director to ensure
that provisions have been made to minimize interference with street traffic flow and assure safe interior vehicular and pedestrian
circulation, transit, and parking.
D. Off-Street Parking Requirements:
1. Schedule A: Unless otherwise expressly stated in this UDC, off-street parking spaces shall be provided in accordance with table 6.6-1 of this
subsection.
a. Fleet Parking: Fleet parking shall be in addition to the minimum parking calculated from table 6.6-1 of this subsection. One fleet parking
space shall be provided for each fleet vehicle. Parking of fleet vehicles outside of a building shall be classified as outdoor storage and shall
be required to be screened in accordance with subsection 10-6-4H8a of this chapter.
b. Future Parking: Development with zoning or development approvals that would permit a future change of use that will require additional
parking to meet the standards of this section shall provide an undeveloped area on the site that can accommodate any future parking
needs. However, such area for future parking need not be paved or improved, but shall be landscaped as required by this UDC.
c. Off-Street Parking Location:
(1) Off-street parking for residential uses shall be located within two hundred feet (200') of the primary building entrance of the primary
building.
(2) Off-street parking for non-residential uses shall be located within six hundred feet (600') of the primary building entrance of the primary
building.
(3) Off-street parking shall be located on the same lot or parcel of land as the structure they are intended to serve unless off-site parking is
approved through the process in subsection E2 of this section.
(4) Off-street parking spaces for non-residential uses shall not be located in front of garage doors.
(5) Off-street parking spaces for non-residential uses may only be located adjacent to building doors when a pedestrian walkway is
provided between the building and all parking spaces on that side of building.
(6) Enclosed off-street parking spaces for non-residential uses must demonstrate that they have public access for customers.
(7) The following shall count toward the minimum parking requirement:

Any development with zoning or development approvals that permit a future change of use that will require additional parking to meet the
standards of this section shall provide an undeveloped area on the site that can accommodate any future parking needs. However, such area
for future parking need not be paved or improved, but shall be landscaped as required by this UDC.
3. Parking Requirements For Miscellaneous Uses: Uses that reference this subsection have widely varying parking and loading demand
characteristics, making it impossible to specify a single off-street parking or loading standard. Upon receiving a development application for a
use subject to this subsection, the building official and the Community Development Director shall apply the off-street parking and loading
standard specified for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use or establish minimum off-street parking requirements on
the basis of a parking and loading study prepared by the applicant. Such a study shall include estimates of parking demand based on
recommendations of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), or other acceptable estimates as approved by the Community
Development Director, and should include other reliable data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same as or
comparable with the proposed use. Comparability will be determined by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location. The study
shall document the source of data used to develop the recommendations.
4. Maximum Number Of Spaces Permitted:
a. General Maximum Requirement: For any use categorized as a "commercial" or "industrial" use in chapter 3 of this title, off-street vehicle
parking spaces shall not be provided in an amount that is more than one hundred twenty five percent (125%) of the minimum requirements
established in subsection D1, table 6.6-1, "Off-Street Parking Schedule A", of this section. The maximum number of allowable parking
spaces may be adjusted by the Community Development Director if the applicant provides written information documenting that the
proposed commercial or industrial use would not be economically viable without such adjustment.
b. Exceptions:
(1) If application of the maximum parking standard would result in less than six (6) parking spaces, the development shall be permitted six
(6) parking spaces.
(2) Exceptions to the maximum parking requirement may be permitted in situations that meet the following criteria by the Community
Development Director:
(A) The proposed development has unique or unusual characteristics such as high sales volume per floor area or low parking turnover,
which create a parking demand that exceeds the maximum ratio and which typically does not apply to comparable uses;
(B) The parking demand cannot be accommodated by on-street parking, shared parking with nearby uses, or by increasing the supply of
spaces that are excepted from the maximum ratio; and
(C) The request is the minimum necessary variation from the standards.
c. Paving Of Excess Parking: Where an exception is granted to the maximum number of spaces permitted on a site pursuant to this section,
the excess parking area shall be covered with pervious paving acceptable to the Town and shall be landscaped as required by this UDC.
d. Calculation Of Maximum Parking Requirements: For the purpose of calculating parking requirements, the following types of parking
spaces shall not count against the maximum parking requirement, but shall count toward the minimum requirement:
(1) Accessible parking;
(2) Vanpool and carpool parking; and
(3) Structured parking, underground parking, and parking within, above, or beneath the building(s) it serves.
E. Parking Alternatives: The Community Development Director may approve alternatives to providing the minimum number of off-street parking
spaces in accordance with the following standards.
Activity Number Of Spaces Required

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 338/449
1. Shared Parking: The Community Development Director may approve shared parking facilities for developments or uses with different
operating hours or different peak business periods if the shared parking complies with all of the following standards:
a. Location: Non-residential shared parking spaces shall be located within six hundred feet (600') of an entrance, and residential shared
parking spaces shall be located within two hundred feet (200') of an entrance unless approved by the Community Development Director.
b. Zoning Classification: Shared parking areas shall be located on a site with the same or a more intensive zoning classification than required
for the primary uses served.
c. Shared Parking Study: Applicants proposing to use shared parking as a means of satisfying off-street parking requirements shall submit a
shared parking analysis that clearly demonstrates the feasibility of shared parking. The study shall be provided in a form established by the
Community Development Director and shall be made available to the public. It shall address, at a minimum, the size and type of the
proposed development, location of required parking, the composition of tenants, the anticipated rate of parking turnover, and the
anticipated peak parking and traffic loads for all uses that will be sharing off-street parking spaces. The applicant shall also demonstrate
that any parking reduction requested as part of the shared parking study will not result in the spillover of parking onto other properties.
d. Agreement For Shared Parking: The parties involved in the joint use of off-street parking facilities shall submit a written agreement in a
form to be recorded for such joint use, approved by the Community Development Director as to form and content. The Community
Development Director may impose such conditions of approval as may be necessary to ensure the adequacy of parking in areas affected
by such an agreement. Recordation of the agreement shall take place before issuance of a building permit for any use to be served by the
shared parking area. A shared parking agreement may be revoked only if all required off-street parking spaces will be provided in
accordance with the requirements of subsection D1, table 6.6-1, "Off-Street Parking Schedule A", of this section.
2. Off-Site Parking: The Community Development Director may approve the location of required off-site parking spaces on a separate lot from
the lot on which the principal use is located if the off-site parking complies with all of the following standards:
a. Location: No off-site nonresidential parking space may be located more than six hundred feet (600') from an entrance and no residential
parking space more than two hundred feet (200') (measured along the shortest legal pedestrian route) unless approved by the Community
Development Director. Off-site parking spaces shall be connected to the use by acceptable pedestrian facilities. Off-site parking spaces
may not be separated from the use served by a street right-of-way with a width of more than eighty feet (80'), unless a grade-separated
pedestrian walkway, a traffic signal, a shuttle bus, or other traffic control is provided or other traffic control or remote parking shuttle bus
service is provided.
b. Zoning Classification: Off-site parking areas shall have the same or a more intensive zoning classification applicable to the primary use
served.
c. Control Of Site: Required parking spaces for residential uses must be located on the site of the use or within a tract owned in common by
all the owners of the properties that will use the tract.
d. Ineligible Activities:
(1) Required parking spaces for persons with disabilities may not be located off-site.
(2) Off-site parking may not be used to satisfy the parking requirements for single-family residential uses.
e. Agreement For Off-Site Parking: In the event that an off-site parking area is not under the same ownership as the principal use served, a
written agreement between the record owners shall be required. The agreement shall guarantee the use of the off-site parking area in
perpetuity. An attested copy of the agreement between the owners of record shall be submitted to the Town for recordation in a form
established by the Town Attorney. Recordation of the agreement shall take place before issuance of a building permit or Certificate of
Occupancy for any use to be served by the off-site parking area. An off-site parking agreement may be revoked only if all required offstreet
parking spaces will be provided in accordance with the requirements of this UDC. No use shall be continued if the parking is
removed unless substitute parking facilities are provided, and the Community Development Director shall be notified at least sixty (60)
days prior to the termination of a lease for off-site parking.
f. On-Street Parking: On-street parking spaces in the right-of-way adjacent to the property may be counted to satisfy the minimum off-street
parking requirements, if approved by the Community Development Director. In Mixed-Use Districts, on-street parking meeting the above
criteria shall be counted towards off-street parking requirements.
3. Downtown District And The NMU (Old Town) District Parking:
a. Commercial Uses: There shall be no minimum off-street parking requirements for any commercial use in the Downtown District and the
NMU (Old Town) District. See subsection I3 of this section for prohibitions on off-street parking areas along street frontage in the
Downtown District and the NMU (Old Town) District.
b. Residential Uses: There shall be minimum off-street parking requirements for any residential uses in the Downtown District and the NMU
(Old Town) District. See subsection I3 of this section for prohibitions on off-street parking areas along street frontage in the Downtown
District and the NMU (Old Town) District.
4. Automatic Parking Reductions In Old Town Residential And Mixed-Use Districts:
a. Old Town Residential District: Applicants for development in the Old Town Residential District are eligible for an automatic parking
reduction of twenty percent (20%) of the minimum parking requirements of this section.
b. Mixed-Use Districts: In the Mixed-Use Districts, the total requirement for off-street parking facilities shall be the sum of the requirements for
the various uses computed separately, subject to the modifications set forth below. The modifications are available cumulatively, but overall
they may not reduce the minimum requirements by more than twenty percent (20%).
(1) Each use within Mixed-Use Districts is eligible for a five percent (5%) parking reduction to reflect the reduced automobile use
associated with mixed-use developments.
10/28/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 339/449
(2) A ten percent (10%) parking reduction for multi-family residential dwelling units may be permitted if the proposed use is located within
three hundred feet (300') of a transit stop with midday service headways of thirty (30) minutes or less in each direction.
(3) For non-residential uses, the minimum parking requirement may be reduced ten percent (10%) if the use incorporates a transit stop
with midday service headways of thirty (30) minutes or less in each direction. The transit stop design shall be compatible with the design
and materials of the non-residential use of which it is associated.
5. District-Wide Parking: Minimum required off-street parking spaces may be waived or reduced for properties within the boundaries of a public
parking or local improvement district that provides district-wide parking facilities, based on the projected parking demand to be addressed by
the district-wide facility.
6. Stacked, Tandem, And Valet Parking: Stacked, tandem, or valet parking for nonresidential uses is permitted if an attendant is present to
move vehicles. In addition, a guarantee acceptable to the Town shall be filed with the Town ensuring that a valet parking attendant shall
always be on duty when the parking lot is in operation.
7. Structured Parking:
a. Maximum Parking Waiver: Where seventy five percent (75%) or more of the parking accessory to a use is in structured parking, there shall
be no maximum cap on the number of parking spaces.
b. Floor Area Bonus For Automated And Underground Parking In The Commercial And Mixed-Use Districts: A height or density bonus may
be granted by the Town for underground parking structures and automated parking structures in the Commercial and Mixed-Use Districts.
The bonus shall be granted at a ratio of three (3) square feet of additional bonus area for each square foot of structured parking that is
underground or within an automated parking structure.
8. Other Eligible Alternatives: At the Town's discretion, the Community Development Director may approve any other alternative to providing
off-street parking spaces on the site of the subject development if the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Community
Development Director that the proposed plan will protect surrounding neighborhoods, maintain traffic circulation patterns, and promote
quality urban design to at least the same extent as would strict compliance with otherwise applicable off-street parking standards.
F. Off-Street Loading Requirements: No building or structure used for any commercial, business, industrial, or public/institutional use shall be
erected, nor shall any such existing building or structure be altered so as to increase its gross floor area by twenty five percent (25%), without
prior provision for off-street loading space in conformance with the following minimum requirements:
1. Types Of Loading Berths: Required off-street loading space shall be provided in berths that conform to the following minimum specifications:
a. Type A berths shall be at least 60 feet long by 10 feet wide by 14 feet 6 inches high, inside dimensions.

3. Uses Not Specifically Mentioned: In the case of a use not specifically mentioned in this section, the requirements for off-street loading
facilities shall be the same as the use mentioned in this section which, in the opinion of the Community Development Director, has most
similar parking characteristics to the use mentioned in terms of loading classification.
4. Concurrent Different Uses: When any proposed structure will be used concurrently for different purposes, final determination of loading
requirements shall be made by the Community Development Director, but in no event shall the loading requirements be less than the total
requirements for each use based upon its aggregate gross floor area.
5. Location Of Off-Street Loading Facilities: Off-street loading facilities required under this section shall be in all cases on the same lot or parcel
of land as the structure they are intended to serve. The required off-street loading space shall not be part of the area used to satisfy the offstreet
parking requirements unless approved by the Community Development Director based on the adequacy of the site to accommodate
both simultaneously. To the maximum extent reasonably feasible, loading areas shall be located to the rear of a site. To the maximum extent
reasonably feasible, off-street loading facilities shall not face adjacent residential areas or in an area with a Residential zoning classification.
To the maximum extent reasonably feasible, off-street loading facilities shall be oriented away from views from the street. Mitigation
techniques, including appropriate siting and site design measures, may be required by the Community Development Director. The Downtown
District shall be excepted from this requirement.
6. Manner Of Using Loading Areas: No space for loading or unloading of vehicles shall be so located that a vehicle using such loading space
projects into any public street. Adequate access and turnaround area shall be provided on-site so that vehicles are not impeding streets.
Loading space shall be provided with access to an alley, or, if no alley adjoins the lot, with access to a street. Any required side or rear yard
may be used for loading unless otherwise prohibited by this UDC. Design and location of entrances and exits for required off-street loading
areas shall be subject to the approval of the Community Development Director based on consideration of the traffic flow and traffic safety.
Service and off-street loading areas shall comply with the screening requirements for such areas set forth in subsection 10-6-4G of this
chapter.
7. Signs: The owners of the property shall provide, locate, and maintain loading signs as specified by the Community Development Director.
Such signs shall not be counted against permitted advertising sign area.
G. Computation Of Parking And Loading Requirements:
1. Fractions: When measurements of the number of required spaces result in a fractional number, any fraction shall be rounded up to the next
higher whole number.
2. Multiple Uses: Lots containing more than one use shall provide parking and loading in an amount equal to the total of the requirements for all
uses.
3. Area Measurements: Unless otherwise specified, all square footage-based parking and loading standards shall be computed on the basis of
gross floor area of the use in question. Structured parking within a building shall not be counted in such measurement.
4. Computation Of Off-Street Parking: Required off-street loading space shall not be included as off-street parking space in computation of
required off-street parking space.
5. Parking For Unlisted Uses: Parking requirements for uses not specifically listed in subsection D1, table 6.6-1 of this section shall be
determined by the Community Development Director based on the requirements for the closest comparable use, as well as on the particular
parking demand and trip generation characteristics of the proposed use. The Community Development Director may alternately require the
submittal of a parking demand study that justifies estimates of parking demand based on the recommendations of the Institute of
Transportation Engineers, and includes relevant data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same or comparable to the
proposed use in terms of density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location.

1. Except for infrequent, special, temporary events not to exceed seven (7) consecutive days, required parking spaces shall be available for the
parking of operable passenger vehicles of residents, customers, patrons, and employees only, and shall not be used for the storage of
vehicles or materials or for the parking of fleet vehicles used in conducting the business or use, for the purpose of displaying goods, or for the
purpose of advertising.
2. Parking for which a fee or other payment is paid or received shall be a principal use, not an accessory use unless approved as part of a
special review use or Planned Unit Development application. (Ord. 13-2018, 3-27-2018)
10-6-7: RESIDENTIAL USE CATEGORY DESIGN STANDARDS:
A. Purpose: The standards of this section are intended to promote high-quality residential development and construction; protect property values;
encourage visual variety and architectural compatibility; and promote an integrated character for the Town's neighborhoods. Specifically, the
standards shall:
1. Promote new residential developments that are distinctive, have character, and relate and connect to established neighborhoods;
2. Provide variety and visual interest in the exterior design of residential buildings;
3. Provide for a variety of lot sizes and housing types for a range of households and age groups;
4. Enhance the residential streetscape and diminish the prominence of garages and parking areas;
5. Enhance public safety by preventing garages from obscuring main entrances or blocking views of the street from inside residences; and
6. Improve the compatibility of attached and multi-family residential development with the residential character of surrounding neighborhoods.
B. Applicability: This section applies to development of all uses classified as "residential" in the "use category" by chapter 3 of this title, unless
otherwise indicated.
C. Alternative Equivalent Compliance: The alternative equivalent compliance procedure in section 10-6-1 of this chapter may be used to propose
alternative means of complying with the intent of this section. The Board of Trustees shall determine alternative equivalent compliance for mix
of housing types in subsection D1 of this section.
D. General Standards For All Residential Development:
1. Mix Of Housing Types:
a. Intent:
(1) To promote a more diverse community through the provision of a variety of housing types.
(2) To encourage developments that are not dominated by a single type of home or dwelling unit, within a narrow range of price points and
densities.
(3) To encourage "neighborhood-oriented" multi-family developments that incorporate a variety of housing types, such as a combination of
duplex, stacked tri-plex/quad-plex, manor homes, live-work units, townhomes, apartments, and single-family dwelling units in a range of
sizes.

results in attractive, long-lasting neighborhoods; and
(2) Discourage the use of "cookie cutter" development patterns for new single-family development.
10/28/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 346/449
b. Applicability: These standards shall apply to all uses classified as "single family detached dwelling unit" by chapter 3 of this title, for all new
lots, in subdivisions created under this UDC, with the following exceptions:
(1) Single-family detached dwelling units in minor subdivisions;
(2) The "architectural character" standards in subsection E1d of this section shall not apply to single-family detached dwelling units in the
Rural Residential (RR), Estate Residential (ER) and Suburban Residential (SR) Zone Districts.
c. Architectural Variety:
(1) Design Standards:
(A) No home model elevation including garage elevation shall be repeated directly across any street from the same home model
elevation.
(B) No home model elevation shall be repeated more than once every four (4) lots on the same side of the street.
(2) Tracking:
(A) It shall be the responsibility of the developer to provide to the Town a plat sheet tracking document that maintains a record of home
model variety for every development parcel. The developer shall demonstrate compliance with this section prior to issuance of a
building permit.
(B) It shall be the responsibility of the developer to disclose these architectural variety standards to potential homebuyers. Failure on the
part of the developer to disclose these requirements shall not be grounds for relief from these architectural variety standards as
applied to any individual home.
d. Architectural Character: Each single-family detached dwelling unit shall meet one of the following materials and design standards:
(1) Materials And Design Standards:
(A) Masonry materials (brick, stone, stucco or other approved masonry materials) shall be utilized on front facades at a ratio of 1:2 (or
higher), of siding to masonry materials. Masonry materials shall wrap around inside corners and return a minimum of two feet (2') at
outside corners, or
(B) Dwelling units that do not meet the 1:2 (or higher) ratio of siding to masonry materials shall be designed with a high level of
architectural detailing, in an architectural style that traditionally does not include masonry materials. Architectural design standards
illustrating a level of architectural detail equal to or better than found within the single-family detached residential areas of the Erie
Commons and Erie Village Subdivisions shall be submitted by the developer for review and approval by the Community Development
Director.
(2) Tracking:
(A) It shall be the responsibility of the developer to submit construction drawings of the elevations for each model of single-family
detached home proposed to be used within the plat. The Town shall review and confirm that the model meets one of the two (2)
requirements in subsection E1d(1) of this section before a building permit may be issued.
2. Orientation Of Dwellings To The Street: Each residence shall have at least one primary pedestrian doorway for access to the dwelling unit
located on the elevation of the dwelling unit facing the front lot line of the property, on or within eight feet (8') of the most forward plane of the
living space within the house, and clearly visible from the street or public area adjacent to the front lot line. On corner lots, the pedestrian
doorway may be located facing any adjacent street. Unless prohibited by terrain or other site constraints, the orientation of new lots shall
repeat the predominant relationship of buildings to buildings and buildings to street along the same block face or the facing block face. An
exception shall be made for alley-loaded single-family detached dwelling units that do not have street frontage but do front onto a park or
park-like common open area. In such case where the dwelling unit does not have street frontage, one primary pedestrian doorway shall be
oriented toward a pedestrian walk in the park that connects to a street.
3. Garages: The regulations for garages shall be applied to all non-living space or storage areas within garages and to all non-living space or
storage spaces of the home.

F. Additional Standards For Multi-Family Residential:
1. Building Design And Character:
a. General Purpose: The purposes of these building design and character standards are to:
(1) Establish a more predictable approach to multi-family development that encourages creativity in design for individualism of buildings or
dwelling units that results in attractive, long-lasting multi-family neighborhoods.
(2) Discourage the use of "cookie cutter" development patterns for new multi-family development that are out of character with the more
"eclectic" design features traditionally found in the Old Town area.
b. Application: These standards shall apply to all multi-family residential development within the Town. Multi-family development shall include:
duplex homes, town homes, stacked tri-plex and quad-plex homes, manor homes, apartments, and small lot single-family homes with lot
sizes less than five thousand (5,000) square feet.
c. Building Orientation:
(1) Intent: To organize the primary entrances and facades of multi-family buildings with a clear orientation towards the street, as opposed
to the more internal organization of buildings typically found with multi-family developments.
(A) To create an integrated neighborhood appearance for multi-family developments that establishes a pattern that is integrated with
adjacent uses instead of segregated as a separate sub-community.
(B) To create an integrated neighborhood appearance for multi-family developments that establishes a pattern that is integrated with
adjacent uses instead of segregated as a separate sub-community.
(2) Design Standards:
(A) The primary entrance and facade of individual buildings within a multi-family development shall be oriented towards:
(i) Primary internal or perimeter streets, or
(ii) Common open space, such as interior courtyards, parks, or on-site natural areas or features with a clearly defined and easily
accessible pedestrian circulation system.
(B) Primary entrances and facades shall not be oriented towards alleys, parking lots, garages, or carports.
d. Architectural Character:
(1) Intent:
10/28/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 348/449
(A) To improve the appearance of multi-family developments through the incorporation of architectural detailing, facade articulation, and
other features designed to provide a more distinct character and human scale for multi-family buildings of all sizes.
(B) To encourage the use of architectural styles that reinforces the Town's traditional character.
(2) Design Standards:
(A) All sides of a multi-family building shall display a similar level of quality and architectural detailing. The majority of a building's
architectural features and treatments shall not be restricted to a single facade. Building details, including roof forms, windows, doors,
trim, and siding materials, shall reflect the architectural style of the building.
(B) On multi-family buildings of ten (10) dwelling units or less, the massing and use of exterior materials is encouraged to be arranged to
give each building the appearance of a large single-family home. This includes duplexes, manor homes, and stacked tri-plex/quadplex
homes but does not necessarily apply to townhomes in which the unique individualism of each dwelling unit is expressed.
(C) The maximum length of any multi-family building shall be one hundred fifty six feet (156').
(D) Blocky, uniform facades are prohibited. The facades of all multi-family buildings shall be articulated through the incorporation of two
(2) or more of the following:

between 3:12 and 12:12; however, alternative roof forms may be permitted at the discretion of the Community Development Director.
(F) Roof overhangs shall be a minimum of twelve inches (12") to establish strong shadow lines and complement the pitch and
architectural style of the structure.
(G) Horizontal variations in materials along the facade of a multi-family building shall occur in conjunction with a change in wall plane,
preferably at the inside corner of a wall.
e. Architectural Variety:
(1) Intent:
(A) To ensure that individual groupings of multi-family buildings within a larger development exhibit a distinct variation in size and mass
that allows them to be easily distinguished from surrounding building groupings.
(B) To avoid the bleak, "barracks-type" appearance associated with large concentrations of identical or very similar structures.

(i) No more than six (6) townhome dwelling units may be attached in any single row or building cluster.
(ii) Within each townhome row or cluster, individual dwelling units shall be differentiated through two (2) or more of the following
methods:
(a) Use of distinct color variation between individual dwelling units;
(b) Use of distinct variations in materials between individual dwelling units;
(c) Use of distinct variations in architectural style or features, such as a porch or similar feature, between individual dwelling units;
(d) Use of distinct variations in roof form;
(e) Variation in garage orientations; or
(f) A variation in the plane of the front facade to provide a minimum three foot (3') variation between individual dwelling units.

4. Block Standards: The requirements set forth in section 10-6-5 of this chapter, shall apply to multi-family residential block design. (Ord. 13-
2018, 3-27-2018)
10-6-8: COMMERCIAL AND PUBLIC/INSTITUTIONAL USE CATEGORIES, MIXED-USE DESIGN STANDARDS:
A. Alternative Equivalent Compliance: The alternative equivalent compliance procedure in section 10-6-1 of this chapter may be used to propose
alternative means of complying with the intent of this section.
B. Standards For The Downtown (DT) And Neighborhood Mixed-Use (NMU - Old Town) Districts:
1. Purpose: These standards are intended to provide guidance for all mixed-use, commercial and public/institutional infill and redevelopment
within the DT and NMU (Old Town) and to ensure that new development respects the small-town scale and historic context of the area. The
standards will assist investors in making design choices that will have a positive impact on both the historic and future character of the DT
and NMU (Old Town). Development in the DT and NMU (Old Town) should respect the historic character and reinforce the image of the DT
and NMU (Old Town) as an attractive, pedestrian-oriented district.
2. Applicability: These standards shall apply to development in the DT and NMU (Old Town) Districts of any structure categorized in chapter 3
of this title, as a "commercial" or "public/institutional" use.
3. Site Layout:
a. Contextual Setback: New structures shall respond to the contextual building setback and orientation of the surrounding structures on the
block. If setbacks on either side of the development site are not consistent, an average of the setbacks found along the block on both sides
of the street may be used.

Structures shall not be oriented at an angle to lot lines.
c. Building To Sidewalk Edge: In the DT District, a minimum of eighty percent (80%) of the primary building facade for new buildings shall be
located adjacent to the sidewalk edge, unless upon review of the contextual setback above, the Community Development Director
determines an alternative setback would be more appropriate.
d. Orientation Of Primary Facade: The primary facade of a structure shall be oriented to the street, not to an interior court.
4. Building Front Width Pattern:
a. In the Downtown District, historic commercial building front width pattern or spacing of facade bays shall be reinforced in new structures.
Storefront-type development shall typically be differentiated every twenty five feet (25') along the block.
b. In the Neighborhood Mixed-Use District, structures wider than twenty five feet (25') shall, to the maximum extent reasonably feasible, be
divided into modules that reflect the traditional building widths of the adjacent properties or the standard twenty five foot (25') storefront
type development.
c. A single, large, dominant building mass on a building front shall be avoided. Buildings wider than twenty five feet (25') along a street shall
design the building to appear as an aggregation of the historical design patterning for building widths found in Old Town that also integrate
variation in height, texture, color and facade depth. All building facades shall have similar levels of architectural detailing.
5. Building Floor Height: The appearance of floors of new buildings shall appear to be similar in height to those of existing historic buildings in
the Downtown. The level of the first floor shall be at or near grade-level at the entrance.

a. Historic Building Styles: New designs shall draw upon the common elements of historic buildings in the community (without copying them).
Examples of common elements include similar fenestration, cornice lines, building widths, and other exterior features. This will allow new
structures to be seen as products of their own time, yet compatible with their historic neighbors.
b. Ground-Floor Pedestrian Interest:
(1) The ground floor of a new building or addition to a building shall encourage pedestrian activity by providing the following elements
along primary pedestrian ways:
(A) A traditional storefront with large display windows, awnings, kick plates and transoms, or public art and landscaping; or decorative
wall surfaces and trims for all applicable use categories, in subsection 10-3-1E, table 3-1 of this title, other than commercial uses of
retail sales and service; food and beverage service; and financial institution.
(B) Traditional storefront elements such as large display windows, awnings, kick plates, and transoms for new buildings with businesses
for commercial uses of retail sales and service; food and beverages service; and financial institution found in subsection 10-3-1E,
table 3-1 of this title. Building additions for businesses in these commercial use categories are encouraged to incorporate the
traditional storefront elements listed above but may use the choices listed in subsection B6b(1)(A) of this section for existing historic
buildings.
(2) Buildings shall avoid blank walls or a vacant lot appearance along streets, primary pedestrian ways, and adjacent residential.
(3) All primary entry doors to the building shall be oriented to the adjacent street. Primary entry doors and entry ways into buildings shall
feature at least three (3) of the elements below:
(A) Awnings;

4. The following setbacks shall be provided to future oil and gas wells and above ground production facilities:
a. Residential lots and non-residential buildings shall be set back a minimum of three hundred fifty feet (350'). This setback may be reduced
as an incentive to developers to co-locate facilities. Developers who propose to co-locate facilities shall provide the Town with a copy of a
recorded surface use agreement with the mineral right owner/lessee prior to approval of a site plan, final plat, or minor subdivision. For
applications that require a preliminary plat, the applicant shall provide the Town with a draft of the surface use agreement and/or a letter
from the mineral right owner/lessee acknowledging that they are actively negotiating a surface use agreement to co-locate the facilities as
represented by the applicant. Any reduction of the three hundred fifty foot (350') setback proposed by the applicant for Town consideration
shall be in compliance with all COGCC regulations and requirements.
b. Street right-of-ways shall be set back a minimum of one hundred fifty feet (150') from future oil and gas wells and above ground facilities.
5. The future oil and gas well and production facilities setbacks identified above shall be identified on the plat.

7. Subdivision design shall address the following Town requirements for future access roads and pipelines to future oil and gas wells and
associated production facilities:
a. Subdivision design shall minimize the need for future access roads to connect with local street classifications. If future access roads are
designed to connect to local streets then the local streets accessed shall be designed to address the weight load requirements of the
vehicles accessing the well and production facilities.
b. An access plan for the future well, production facilities, and pipelines shall be submitted to the Town. The plan shall identify which local
streets that are impacted by well access needs. The streets identified shall be designed to address the weight load requirements of the
vehicles accessing the well and production facilities. The plan shall also identify routing of future pipelines so that the appropriate
easements and/or tracts can be created during the platting process to accommodate the pipelines.
c. Future gas and oil well pipelines and their associated easements on the final plat shall not be located on residential lots.
d. Streets shall be platted so future pipelines will cross at a substantially right angle to the street.
e. The final plat shall show easements for future gas and oil well pipelines that are a minimum of thirty feet (30') wide. (Ord. 13-2018, 3-27-
2018)

10-7-2: COMMON DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCEDURES:
The common development review procedures in this section shall apply to all types of development applications under this chapter, unless an
exception to the common procedures is expressly called for in the particular development application requirements in subsequent sections of this
chapter.
A. Step 1; Pre-Application Conference:
1. Purpose: The purpose of a pre-application conference is to provide an opportunity for an informal evaluation of the applicant's proposal and
to familiarize the applicant and the Town staff with the applicable provisions of this UDC, the Town's Comprehensive Master Plan, and other
documents as may be appropriate, including the Town's Parks, Recreation, Open Space and Trails Master Plan and the Town's Standards
and Specifications for Design and Construction of Public Improvements, infrastructure requirements, and any other issues that may affect the
applicant's proposal.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 366/449
Changes to already-approved special review uses and subdivision plans that exceed these thresholds shall require a pre-application
conference.
c. Optional For All Other Applications: A pre-application conference is optional prior to submission of any other application under this UDC
not listed as requiring a conference in section 10-7-1, table 7.1-1 of this chapter.
3. Initiation Of Pre-Application Conference: The applicant shall request a pre-application conference with the Community Development Director
and pay the required fee, if applicable. With the request for a pre-application conference, the applicant shall provide to the Community
Development Director a description of the character, location, and magnitude of the proposed development and any other supporting
documents, such as maps, drawings, models, and the type of application. It is the applicant's responsibility to provide sufficiently detailed
plans and descriptions of the proposal for staff to make the informal recommendations discussed below.
4. Pre-Application Conference Content: The Community Development Director shall schedule a pre-application conference after receipt of a
proper request. At the conference, the applicant, the Community Development Director or designee, and any other persons the Community
Development Director deems appropriate to attend shall discuss the proposed development. Based upon the information provided by the
applicant and the provisions of this UDC, the parties should discuss in general the proposed development and the applicable requirements
and standards of this UDC.
5. Informal Evaluation Not Binding: The informal evaluation of the Community Development Director and staff provided at the conference are
not binding upon the applicant or the Town, but are intended to serve as a guide to the applicant in making the application and advising the
applicant in advance of the formal application of issues which may be presented to the appropriate decision-making body.
6. Application Required Within Six Months: After a pre-application conference has been held, an application must be submitted within six (6)
months or sooner if required by the Community Development Director due to changing conditions. If an application is not filed within such
timeframe, a new pre-application conference shall be required prior to filing an application, unless waived by the Community Development
Director.
7. Optional Planning Commission Conference: At the applicant's request, the Planning Commission may grant an application conference,
which shall be in addition to the required pre-application conference with the Community Development Director.
B. Step 2; Development Application Submittal:
1. Form Of Application: Applications and submission materials required under this chapter shall be submitted in a form and in such number as
required by the Community Development Director and described in the User's Guides.
2. UDC User's Guide: The Community Development Director shall compile the requirements for application contents, forms, fees, and the
submission materials and review schedule in a User's Guide, which shall be made available to the public. The Community Development
Director may amend and update the User's Guide from time to time.
3. Consolidated Development Applications And Review: Multiple development applications for the same development proposal may be
consolidated for submittal and review, as required by the Community Development Director and the User's Guide and depending upon the
complexity of the proposal. Such consolidated applications shall be reviewed, considered, and decided upon by the highest level decisionmaker
that would have decided any of the individual review processes under this chapter had they been submitted, processed, and
considered as separate development applications. Decision-makers, from highest level to lowest level for purposes of this subsection, are
the Board of Trustees, the Planning Commission, and the Community Development Director, respectively. Annexation and zoning
applications cannot be consolidated with subdivision and site plan applications. Site plan applications can be submitted and processed
concurrently with preliminary plat applications; however a site plan application can only be given final approval after a final plat approval is
granted. While the noted types of applications cannot be consolidated into one application, the individual applications can be processed
simultaneously.
4. Authority To File Applications:
a. Unless otherwise specified in this UDC, applications for review and approval may be initiated by:
(1) The owner of the property that is the subject of the application; or
(2) The owner's authorized agent; or
(3) The Board of Trustees; or
(4) Other entities that have rights provided by law.
b. When an authorized agent files an application under this UDC on behalf of a property owner, the agent shall provide the Town with written
documentation that the owner of the property has authorized the filing of the application.
c. When a review or decision-making body initiates action pursuant to this UDC, it does so without influencing the approval or denial of the
application.
5. Development Review Fees:
a. Recovery Of Costs: Development review fees are hereby established for the purpose of recovering the costs incurred by the Town in
processing, reviewing, and recording applications pertaining to development applications or activity within the Town or its Comprehensive
Master Plan area. In addition, an applicant shall pay all costs billed by the Town for costs incurred in review of an application, including
attorney fees, review fees from consultants acting as staff or other fees. The applicant shall pay the development review fees imposed
pursuant to this section, at the time of submittal of any development application. The applicant, as required herein, shall pay other costs as
the Town incurs them.
10/28/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 367/449
b. Development Review Fee Schedule: The amount of the Town's development review fees shall be established by the Board of Trustees,
and shall be based on the actual expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Town. The schedule of fees are noted in title 2 of the Municipal
Code and on the Land Use Application. The schedule of fees may be reviewed annually by the Community Development Director, on the
basis of actual expenses incurred by the Town to reflect the effects of inflation and other changes in costs. If an adjustment to the fee
schedule is warranted, the revised schedule shall be referred to the Board of Trustees for approval.
c. Outstanding Fees And Costs: All fees and costs shall be paid by the applicant prior to scheduling of hearings or meetings for any
development application. No new applications shall be accepted by the Town until all previous fees and costs associated with an applicant,
application or property are paid in full.
6. Waivers: The Community Development Director may waive certain submittal requirements when such submittal requirements are unrelated
to any project impacts, or to reduce the burden on the applicant by tailoring the requirements to produce only the information necessary to
review any particular application. The Community Development Director may waive such requirements when it is determined that the
projected size, complexity, anticipated impacts, or other factors associated with the proposed development clearly support such waiver.
7. Additional Information: Additional application-specific information may be required by the Community Development Director, Public Works
Director, Planning Commission, and/or Board of Trustees, as necessary and appropriate to evaluate fully whether an application complies
with the requirements of this UDC.
8. Inactive Files: If an applicant fails to submit required information for a period of more than six (6) months from the initial request, the
application shall become void and the re-submittal of a new application and fees shall be required. The Community Development Director
may grant no more than two (2) extensions of time to this provision, of no more than six (6) months each, upon a written request by the
applicant.
C. Step 3; Determination Of Application Completeness: After receipt of the development application, the Community Development Director shall
determine whether the application is complete and ready for formal processing.
1. If the application is determined to be complete, the application shall then be processed according to the procedures set forth in this UDC. An
application shall be considered complete if it is submitted in the required form, includes all mandatory information and supporting materials
specified in the User's Guide, and is accompanied by the applicable fee or fees. The determination of completeness by the Community
Development Director shall not be based upon the perceived merits of the development proposal.
2. If an application is determined to be incomplete, the Community Development Director shall provide notice to the applicant along with an
explanation of the application's deficiencies. Further processing of an incomplete application shall not occur until the deficiencies are
corrected in a future re-submittal.
3. If any false or misleading information is submitted or supplied by an applicant on an application, that application will be deemed incomplete.
D. Step 4; Neighborhood Meeting:
1. Purpose: The purpose of a neighborhood meeting is to provide an informal opportunity to inform the residents and landowners of the
surrounding neighborhood(s) of the details of a proposed development and application, how the developer intends to meet the standards
contained in this UDC, and to receive public comment and encourage dialogue at an early time in the review process. No decision regarding
the application will be made at the neighborhood meeting.
2. Applicability: A neighborhood meeting shall be required for any development proposal that will be subject to Planning Commission review,
unless otherwise indicated in this chapter. However, the Community Development Director may waive the neighborhood meeting requirement
if it is determined that the development proposal would not have significant impacts in any of the areas listed below. The waiver shall be in
writing and shall be included as part of the case record.
a. Traffic;
b. Natural resources protected under this UDC;

amendments under the criteria set forth in subsection K1 of this section, shall be deemed major amendments. Major amendments to
approvals under this UDC shall be reviewed and processed in the same manner as required for the original application for which amendment
is sought. Any major amendments shall be recorded as amendments in accordance with the procedures established for the filing and
recording of such initial approvals.

10-7-6: REZONING - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS:
A. Purpose: In order to promote creative design efforts on the part of owners, builders, architects, and developers, and also to produce
developments that are in keeping with the overall land use intensity and open space objectives of the Town's Comprehensive Master Plan, this
section makes available a procedure to depart from the requirements of this UDC through a rezoning to a Planned Unit Development ("PUD")
Overlay District. The intent of the PUD Overlay District is to permit flexibility from the requirements of the underlying base zoning districts, in
exchange for greater public benefits than would otherwise be achieved through development under this UDC.
B. PUD Development Plans Required: Approval of a PUD development plan is required prior to development in a PUD Overlay District. A PUD
plan shall be submitted with the request for rezoning to the PUD Overlay District. A PUD plan shall be submitted concurrently with a subdivision
application. A PUD development plan is subject to recommendation by the Planning Commission and approval by the Board of Trustees.
C. Coordination With Subdivision Review:
1. It is the intent of this UDC that subdivision review required under section 10-7-7 of this chapter, if applicable, be carried out concurrently with
the review of PUD development plans under this section. If subdivision approval is required for the subject property, the PUD plans required
under this section shall be submitted in a form that satisfies the requirements for preliminary and final subdivision plat approvals. A PUD
typically should be reviewed with the preliminary plat and subject to approval, approval with conditions or denial. A PUD that is approved by
the Board of Trustees concurrently with a preliminary plat approval shall not be recorded and come into effect until a final plat is approved
and recorded for the property.
2. If any provisions of this section or the PUD standards of subsection 10-2-7D2 of this title conflict with the subdivision procedures or
standards of this UDC, the more restrictive or detailed requirements shall be met, unless specifically altered by the Board of Trustees through
the minor modification process.
D. Procedure For Review Of PUD Plans:
1. Step 1 (Pre-Application Conference): Applicable.
2. Step 2 (Development Application Submittal): Applicable, see User's Guide for submittal requirements.
a. PUD Development Plan: The application for PUD rezoning shall include a PUD development plan prepared to the specifications in the
User's Guide. The Community Development Director shall require sufficient detail in the PUD development plan to provide an opportunity
10/28/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 375/449
for the approving bodies to make informed decisions and evaluate compliance with the applicable approval criteria. The application shall
include, at a minimum:
(1) A quantitative summary of existing conditions on the subject property, as specified in the User's Guide;
(2) A list of uses to be permitted within the PUD by right and a list of uses to be permitted only with a special review use permit;
(3) Intensity or density of uses proposed;
(4) Location of public and private open space, parks and trails;
(5) Location of existing and proposed buildings on the site;
(6) Road, street, and pedestrian networks proposed;
(7) Drainage facilities;
(8) Existing or proposed utilities and public services;

A. Purpose: The purpose of the subdivision review process is to ensure compliance with the subdivision standards and requirements set forth in
chapter 6 of this title, while encouraging quality development generally consistent with the goals, policies, and objectives found in the Town's
Comprehensive Master Plan.
B. Applicability:
1. General: The procedures of this section, and the standards and requirements set forth in chapter 6 of this title, shall apply to all subdivisions
or re-subdivisions that result in the portioning, dividing, combining, or altering of any lot, parcel, or tract of land, including subdivisions or resubdivisions
created by an exercise of the power of eminent domain by an agency of the State or Town, unless specifically excluded by State
law.
2. Subdivision Approval Is Prerequisite To Other Approvals:
a. No building permit or Certificate of Occupancy may be issued for any building, structure, or improvement located within a subdivision, and
no plat for a subdivision may be recorded, until:
(1) A plan for the subdivision has been approved and all required dedications of land have been made, and all required improvements
have been installed in accordance with the procedures and requirements of this section; or
(2) A plan for the subdivision of land has been approved and a Development Agreement has been executed that provides for future
improvements pursuant to section 10-7-18 of this chapter.
b. The Town shall not accept or maintain any street and shall not extend or connect any street lighting, water service, or sanitary sewer
service to any subdivision of land, until and unless a plat for the subdivision has been approved and recorded in accordance with the
requirements set forth in this section.
3. Restriction On Sale Or Transfer Of Subdivided Land Without Approved Plat: Any person who transfers or sells any land located within the
Town by reference to a plat that has not been approved by the Town and recorded by the appropriate County shall be guilty of a violation of
this UDC. The Town also may enjoin such transfer or sale by filing an action for an injunction.
4. Existing Lots Of Record: No provision of this section or chapter 6 of this title applies to any lot in a subdivision legally created and filed of
record before the effective date of this UDC, unless the lot is further subdivided.
C. Procedure For Review Of Sketch Plans And Preliminary Plats:
1. Step 1 (Pre-Application Conference): Applicable to sketch plan only.
2. Step 2A (Development Application Submittal - Sketch Plan): Two (2) types of application submittals are required - first, a sketch plan,
followed by a preliminary plat. The sketch plan requirements are listed in this subsection. The preliminary plat requirements are listed in
subsection C3 of this section as "step 2B". Applications for subdivision shall only be accepted for property annexed into the Municipality. A
subdivision application cannot be reviewed concurrently with an annexation application.
a. Purpose: A sketch plan represents a generalized land use plan and layout for the area proposed to be included within a subdivision.
Sketch plan is required to allow early, informal evaluation of a proposed subdivision before detailed planning and engineering work has
been undertaken and before substantial expenses have been incurred by the applicant.
b. Sketch Plan Submittal Requirements: A sketch plan shall be prepared and submitted to the Community Development Director pursuant to
the User's Guide. An Alta Survey shall be prepared and submitted to illustrate the existing conditions on the property and, at a minimum,
the sketch plan shall contain the following:
(1) Uses proposed;
(2) Intensity or density of uses proposed;
(3) Location of public and private open space;
(4) Drainage facilities;
(5) Road, street, and pedestrian networks proposed; and
(6) Existing or proposed utilities and public services for the development.
c. Staff Review: The Community Development Department shall review the sketch plan, focusing on standards and criteria of this UDC that
are applicable to the proposed development. The Community Development Department shall summarize the results of the review in writing
and provide a copy to the applicant. The summary shall include any special information regarding the proposed project, plus an evaluation
of the proposal with respect to the current policies of the Town, identifying areas of potential compatibility or conflict with these policies. All
comments made by the Community Development Department shall not be binding on the Town's consideration of any subsequent
application, and are intended only to provide an informal evaluation of the proposed project.
d. Meeting To Discuss Sketch Plan: At the request of the Community Development Director or applicant, the parties shall meet to discuss the
results of the review. The applicant shall be informed of the necessary provisions of this UDC relating to subdivision application, including
submittal requirements, required public improvements, design standards, and Development Agreements. The Community Development
Director shall inform the applicant whether or not a Planning Commission review shall be required.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 378/449
e. Planning Commission Review: In addition to the staff review the Community Development Director may require that the sketch plan be
reviewed by the Planning Commission or the applicant may request this review. The staff review summary shall be submitted to the
Planning Commission for consideration. All comments made by the Planning Commission shall not be binding on the Town's consideration
of any subsequent application, and are intended only to provide an informal evaluation of the proposed project.
f. Effect Of Review: The sketch plan is not part of a formal application for approval of a subdivision and any comments made by the Town in
reaction to a sketch plan shall not be binding on the Town's consideration of any subsequent preliminary or final plat application, nor result
in a vested property right under this UDC or State Statute. Since the sketch plan is conceptual only, there are no lapse provisions
applicable.
3. Step 2B (Development Application Submittal - Preliminary Plat): Applicable, see User's Guide for submittal requirements:
A preliminary plat shall include all land under contiguous ownership unless separate legal descriptions exist as a matter of record. If only a
portion of the land is intended for immediate development, the remaining portion shall be given a tract number and shall be considered a part
of the preliminary plat and final plat. Requirements for surveying this remaining tract may be waived at the discretion of the Community
Development Director.
4. Step 3 (Determination Of Application Completeness): Applicable to both sketch plan and preliminary plat.
5. Step 4 (Neighborhood Meeting): Applicable to preliminary plat only.
6. Step 5 (Application Referral, Review And Staff Report): Applicable to preliminary plat only.
7. Step 6 (Notice): Applicable to preliminary plat only. Subdivision applicants shall comply with the notice and other requirements contained in
Colorado Revised Statutes section 31-23-213 et seq.
8. Step 7 (Public Hearings): Applicable to preliminary plat only. Two (2) public hearings are required. The first hearing shall be held by the
Planning Commission, and the second hearing shall be held by the Board of Trustees.
9. Step 8 (Decision And Findings): Applicable. The following additional procedures shall apply:
a. Public Hearing And Recommendation By Planning Commission:
(1) The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the preliminary plat. Notice for the public hearing shall be published, posted,
and mailed as set forth in subsection 10-7-2F of this chapter. A copy of the preliminary plat filed with the Town shall be available for
public viewing during regular business hours. Anyone may submit written comments on the preliminary plat, to the Planning Commission
on or before the date for the public hearing.
(2) At the public hearing, the Planning Commission shall consider staff recommendations and any comments received from the referral
agencies, public comments, and based on the applicable approval criteria below, recommend that the Board approve, conditionally
approve, or deny the application; table the application for further review; or continue the hearing to a new date. The Planning
Commission shall have the authority to recommend changes in the preliminary plat which more fully meet the purposes of this UDC.
(3) The Planning Commission shall notify the Board of Trustees of its recommendation concerning the preliminary plat. If denied, the
reasons for denial shall be stated upon the records of the Planning Commission.
b. Review And Decision By Board Of Trustees: The Board of Trustees shall review the preliminary plat application at a scheduled and
noticed public hearing. The Board of Trustees shall consider the Planning Commission's recommendations and approve, conditionally
10/28/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 379/449
approve, or deny the application, or table the application for further review, based on the applicable approval criteria below.
c. Additional Documentation: In its review of the preliminary plat the Board of Trustees and/or the Planning Commission may determine that
additional maps, reports, certifications, or agreements are necessary before making a decision on the proposal. In such cases either
decision making body may require that the additional evidence be submitted before a finding is made.
d. Denial Of A Preliminary Plat: If denied, the reasons for denial shall be stated upon the records of the Board of Trustees.
e. Effect Of Approval: Approval of a preliminary plat shall be deemed an expression of approval to the layouts submitted on the preliminary
plat to lots, density, and the future installation of streets, water, sewer, and other required improvements and utilities and to the preparation
of the final plat.
f. Construction Work: No construction work shall begin on the proposed improvements in the proposed subdivision prior to approval of the
final plat. The subdivider may undertake certain ground excavations for grading and drainage purposes if the proper permits are issued by
the Community Development and/or Public Works Department, at the subdivider's risk.
g. New Application Following Denial: A final plat application cannot be filed, after a preliminary plat denial, without first submitting and
obtaining approval for a new preliminary plat application. No new application for the same or substantially the same preliminary plat shall
be accepted by the Community Development Director within one year of denial of the original application. The waiting period required by
this section may be waived in an individual case, based upon new evidence or changed circumstances, by the Community Development
Director.
10. Step 9 (Approval Criteria): Applicable, as follows: A preliminary plat may be approved only if the Board of Trustees finds that all of the
following criteria have been met:
a. The subdivision is generally consistent with the Town's Comprehensive Master Plan.
b. The subdivision is generally consistent with and implements the intent of the specific zoning district in which it is located.
c. The general layout of lots, streets, driveways, utilities, drainage facilities, and other services within the proposed subdivision is designed to
meet the Town's standards related to health and safety and in a way that minimizes the amount of land disturbance, maximizes the amount
of open space in the development, preserves existing trees/vegetation and riparian areas, protects critical wildlife habitat, and otherwise
accomplishes the purposes and intent of this UDC.
d. The subdivision complies with all applicable use, development, and design standards set forth in chapters 3, 5 and 6 of this title that have
not otherwise been modified or waived pursuant to this chapter or this UDC. Applicants shall refer to the development standards in chapter
5 of this title and shall consider them in the layout of the subdivision in order to avoid creating lots or patterns of lots in the subdivision that
will make compliance with such development and design standards difficult or infeasible.
e. The subdivision complies with all applicable regulations, standards, requirements, or plans of the Federal or State governments and other
relevant jurisdictions, including but not limited to wetlands, water quality, erosion control, and wastewater regulations.
f. The subdivision will not result in significant adverse impacts on the natural environment, including air, water, noise, stormwater
management, wildlife, and vegetation, or such impacts will be substantially mitigated.
g. The subdivision shall be integrated and connected, where appropriate, with adjacent development through street connections, sidewalks,
trails, and similar features.
h. The subdivision will not result in significant adverse impacts on adjacent properties, or such impacts will be substantially mitigated.
i. Adequate and sufficient public safety, transportation, utility facilities and services, recreation facilities, parks, and schools are available to
serve the subject property, while maintaining sufficient levels of service to existing development.
j. As applicable, the proposed phasing plan for development of the subdivision is rational in terms of available infrastructure capacity.
11. Step 10 (Conditions Of Approval): Applicable.
12. Step 11 (Amendments): Applicable.
13. Step 12 (Lapse): Applicable, as follows:
a. Approval of a preliminary plat shall be effective for one year unless reviewed by the Board of Trustees in the light of new or significant
information that would necessitate the revision of the preliminary plat. If no development or change in requirements has occurred that
would affect the proposed plat at the end of the year of an effective approval, the Board of Trustees may, at the request of the applicant,
extend its approval another year without the submission of a new preliminary plat by re-approving the original preliminary plat. No filing fee
is required for such re-approval. However, no extensions of approval shall be granted more than once.
b. An approved preliminary plat shall lapse and be of no further force and effect if a complete final plat application for the subdivision or a
phase of the subdivision has not been submitted within any time-frame specified by the Board of Trustees or, if no time-frame was
established by the Board, then within twenty four (24) months after the approval date. In the case of partial final plat submission, the
approval of the remaining portion of the preliminary plat shall automatically gain an extension of one year.
D. Procedure For Review Of Final Plats:
1. Step 1 (Pre-Application Conference): Applicable.
2. Step 2 (Development Application Submittal): Applicable, see User's Guide for submittal requirements.
The final plat shall include all land under contiguous ownership unless separate legal descriptions exist as a matter of record. If only a portion

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 380/449
of the land is intended for immediate development, the remaining portion shall be given a tract number and shall be considered a part of the
final plat. Requirements for surveying this remaining tract may be waived at the discretion of the Community Development Director.
3. Step 3 (Determination Of Application Completeness): Applicable.
4. Step 4 (Neighborhood Meeting): Not applicable.
5. Step 5 (Application Referral, Review And Staff Report): Applicable.
6. Step 6 (Notice): Not applicable.

8. Step 8 (Decision And Findings): Applicable. The following additional procedures shall apply:
a. Community Development Director's Review And Decision: The Community Development Director shall review each proposed final plat
application relative to the applicable approval criteria listed below. All construction plans for subdivision-related public improvements shall
be referred to the Public Works Director for review and approval. Based on the results of those reviews, the Community Development
Director shall act to approve, approve with conditions, or deny the proposed final plat. If the Community Development Director finds that
the final plat materials do not comply with the applicable requirements of this UDC, the Community Development Director may refer it back
to the applicant for modification or further study. The Community Development Director shall make a final decision on the final plat.
b. Final Plats That Differ From Approved Preliminary Plats: If the final plat is found not to be in substantial compliance with the approved
preliminary plat, the Community Development Director shall refer the application to the Planning Commission, and the Board of Trustees.
The final plat submittal shall require review and approval in the same manner as the preliminary plat (i.e., hearings before the Planning
Commission and the Board of Trustees).
c. Effect Of Approval:
(1) Recording: Following the approval of a final plat, which shall have all permitted modifications, waivers, or variances expressly noted
thereon, the final plat shall be signed by the Mayor or other authorized Town representative. The Town shall then record the final plat
and any signed subdivision improvements Development Agreement in the Office of the appropriate County Clerk and Recorder. The
applicant shall pay all required recording fees.
(2) Lapse Of Approval: The approved final plat documents shall be recorded within sixty (60) days of approval. Upon written request by the
applicant or staff, the Community Development Director may grant one extension for a maximum of sixty (60) days due to unique
circumstances that make it impractical to file the final plat documents within sixty (60) days from approval. Final plat approval shall be
null and void and shall automatically lapse if recordation does not occur within the time specified.
d. Acceptance Of Dedications: Recordation of the approved final plat shall constitute the Town's preliminary acceptance of any public
dedication, subject to an improvements guarantee.
e. Improvements Guarantees: The subdivider shall provide any required guarantees to the Town Clerk prior to the recording of the final plat,
unless otherwise authorized by the Board of Trustees. For a period of two (2) years after receipt of an acceptance letter from the Town, the
applicant shall guarantee the conditions of all public facilities and be responsible for the structural maintenance and the repair of any
defects that may emerge during that period. Maintenance of those areas not formally accepted shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
At the end of two (2) years, the applicant shall petition the Town for formal final release from the responsibility for the improvements. The
Town shall then inspect the improvements and determine whether the applicant has met the conditions specified in the preliminary
acceptance. If conditions have been met, the Town shall release the applicant from responsibility for the improvements. Upon final
acceptance, it shall be the Town's responsibility to maintain and repair all such improvements.
f. Development Agreements: The Mayor or other authorized Town representative shall sign any related development agreement.

10-7-8: MINOR MODIFICATIONS:
A. Purpose And Scope: This section sets forth the required review and approval procedures for "minor modifications", which are minor deviations
from otherwise applicable standards that may be approved by the Community Development Director, the Board of Trustees, or the Planning
Commission. Minor modifications are to be used when the small size of the modification requested, and the unlikelihood of any adverse effects
on nearby properties or the neighborhood, make it unnecessary to complete a formal variance process.
B. Applicability:
1. Minor Modifications To General Development And Zoning District Standards: As part of the review and approval of any procedure set forth in
this chapter, the Board of Trustees, the Planning Commission, or the Community Development Director may approve minor modifications of
up to a maximum of ten percent (10%) from the following general development and zoning district standards, including Planned Development
(PD) District standards, provided that the applicable approval criteria listed below are met.
a. Minimum lot area requirements;
b. Setback requirements;
c. Subdivision design and improvement standards set forth in chapter 5 of this title; and
d. Quantitative development standards set forth in chapter 6 of this title (e.g., number of parking spaces);
2. Exceptions To Authority To Grant Minor Modifications: Notwithstanding subsection B1 of this section, in no circumstance shall any decisionmaking
body approve a minor modification that results in:
a. An increase in overall project density;
b. A change in permitted uses or mix of uses;
c. An increase in building height;
d. A deviation from the use-specific standards, set forth in section 10-3-2 of this title; or
e. A change in conditions attached to the approval of any plat, site plan, or special review use.
C. Procedure:
1. Minor Modifications Approved By Community Development Director: The Community Development Director may initiate or approve a minor
modification permitted under this section at any time prior to submittal of the staff report on an application to another decision-making body,
or prior to final decision if the Community Development Director is the final decision-maker.
2. Minor Modifications Approved By Board Of Trustees Or Planning Commission: The Board of Trustees or Planning Commission may initiate
or approve a minor modification permitted under this section at any time before it takes action on a development application under its
10/28/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 386/449
respective jurisdiction.
3. Noted On Pending Application: Staff shall specify any approved minor modifications and the justifications for such modifications on the
pending development application for which the modifications were sought.
D. Approval Criteria: The decision-making body may approve the minor modification only if it finds that the modification meets all of the criteria
below:
1. The requested modification is generally consistent with the Town's Comprehensive Master Plan and the stated purpose of this UDC;
2. The requested modification meets all other applicable Building and Safety Codes;
3. The requested modification does not encroach into a recorded easement;
4. The requested modification will have no significant adverse impact on the health, safety, or general welfare of surrounding property owners
or the general public, or such impacts will be substantially mitigated; and
5. The requested modification is necessary to either: a) compensate for some practical difficulty or some unusual aspect of the site of the
proposed development not shared by landowners in general; or b) accommodate an alternative or innovative design practice that achieves to
the same or better degree the objective of the existing design standard to be modified. In determining if "practical difficulty" exists, the
approval criteria for variances in section 10-7-9 of this chapter, shall be considered. (Ord. 13-2018, 3-27-2018)
10-7-9: VARIANCES:
A. Purpose And Scope: The variance process is intended to provide limited relief from the requirements of this UDC in those cases where strict
application of a particular requirement will create a practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship prohibiting the use of land in a manner otherwise
permitted under this UDC. It is not intended that variances be granted merely to remove inconveniences or financial burdens that the
requirements of this UDC may impose on property owners in general. Rather, it is intended to provide relief where the requirements of this UDC
render the land difficult or impossible to use because of some unique physical attribute of the property itself or some other factor unique to the
property for which the variance is requested. State and/or Federal laws or requirements may not be varied by the Town.
B. Procedure:
1. Step 1 (Pre-Application Conference): Applicable.
2. Step 2 (Development Application Submittal): Applicable, see User's Guide for submittal requirements.
3. Step 3 (Determination Of Application Completeness): Applicable, with the following modification: A request for variance may be initiated only
by the property owner or his authorized representative. The application must state with particularity the relief sought and must specify the
facts or circumstances that are alleged to show that the application meets the approval criteria listed below.

UDC which are in question.
b. No variance shall be granted that violates the intent of this UDC or its amendments.
c. No variance shall be granted from any written conditions attached by another decision-making body to the approval of a special review
use, plat or site plan.
d. No variance shall be granted if the conditions or circumstances affecting the applicant's property are of so general or recurrent a nature as
to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation for such conditions or situations.
e. No variance may authorize a use other than those permitted in the district for which the variance is sought; also, an application or request
for a variance shall not be heard or granted with regard to any parcel of property or portion thereof upon which zoning request for any

NONCONFORMITIES
10-9-1: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
A. Purpose: The purpose of this chapter is to regulate and limit the development and continued existence of zoned legal uses, structures, lots,
signs, and use characteristics such as parking and landscaping, established prior to the effective date of this UDC, or the effective date of
future amendments to this UDC, that no longer conform to the requirements of this UDC. All such situations are collectively referred to in this
chapter as "nonconformities". While nonconformities may continue, the provisions of this chapter are designed to curtail substantial investment
in nonconformities to bring about their eventual elimination in order to preserve the integrity of this UDC and the character of the Town.
B. Authority To Continue:
10/28/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 410/449
1. Generally: Any nonconformity that lawfully existed as of the effective date of this UDC and that remains nonconforming, and any
nonconformity that is created as a result of any subsequent rezoning or amendment to the text of this UDC, may be continued or maintained
as a nonconformity only in accordance with the terms of this chapter.
2. Exception Due To Variances Or Minor Modifications: Notwithstanding subsection B1 of this section, this chapter shall not apply to any
development standard or feature that is the subject of a variance or minor modification granted under this UDC. Where a variance or minor
modification has been granted that results in a development standard or feature that does not otherwise conform to the requirements of this
UDC, that development standard or feature shall be deemed conforming.
3. Special Review Uses:
a. A permitted use existing prior to the effective date of this UDC that is permitted as a special review use in the district in which it is located
under this UDC, but which lacks an approved special review use permit, shall be considered to exist as a conforming special review use.
b. A special review use existing prior to the effective date of this UDC that is permitted in its entirety as a principal use in the district in which
it is located under this UDC shall be deemed a permitted principal use and the special review use permit shall be null and void.
C. Determination Of Nonconformity Status: In all cases, the burden of establishing the existence of a legal nonconformity shall be solely upon the
owner of the nonconformity, not the Town.
D. Nonconformities Created Through Government Action: If a structure, use of land, use of structure, or characteristic of use does not comply with
the requirements of this UDC solely as a result of an acquisition of land or other action by a government agency for a public purpose, then such
structure, use of land, use of structure, or characteristic of use on land not acquired by the government shall be deemed conforming. For
purposes of this section the word "land" means fee simple interest in real estate.
E. Change Of Ownership Or Tenancy: Changes of ownership, tenancy, or management of property with an existing nonconformity are permitted
but such nonconformities shall continue to be subject to the provisions of this chapter.
F. Damage Or Destruction:
1. If a nonconformity is damaged or destroyed by any means to an extent greater than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement cost at the time of
damage or destruction, then such nonconformity shall not be re-established unless it is made to conform to the requirements of this UDC.
2. Where a nonconforming building is damaged less than fifty percent (50%) of the cost of reconstructing the entire structure, it may be repaired
or restored, provided any such repair or restoration is started within twelve (12) months and is completed within eighteen (18) months from
the date of partial destruction.
3. The chief building official shall determine the above reconstruction costs. The cost of land or any factors other than the cost of the structure
are excluded in the determination of cost of restoration for any building or activity devoted to a nonconforming use.
4. These requirements shall not apply in the Downtown, Neighborhood Mixed-Use (Old Town) and Old Town Residential Districts.
G. Maintenance And Minor Repair:
1. Minor repairs or maintenance of nonconformities that are required to keep structures or sites in a safe condition are permitted, provided that
the minor repair or maintenance does not increase the extent of nonconformity. For purposes of this section, "maintenance or minor repair"
shall mean:
a. Repairs that are necessary to maintain and to correct any damage or deterioration to the structural soundness or interior appearance of a
building or structure without expanding or altering the building or structure;
b. Maintenance of land areas to protect against health and environmental hazards and promote the safety of surrounding land uses;
c. Repairs that are required to remedy unsafe conditions that cause a threat to public safety; and
d. Repairs and maintenance of nonconforming signs as set forth in section 10-9-5 of this chapter. (Ord. 13-2018, 3-27-2018)
10-9-2: NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND:
A. Limitations On Continuation Of Nonconforming Uses Of Land: Nonconforming uses of land or structures may continue, subject to the general
provisions of section 10-9-1 of this chapter and the following limitations:
1. No nonconforming use of land shall be enlarged or increased or extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of the regulations that make the use nonconforming. Any nonconforming use on a lot or portion
thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity.
2. No nonconforming use of land shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at
the effective date of adoption or amendment of the regulations that make the use nonconforming.
3. No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this UDC in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed,
reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use of the structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located.
10/28/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 411/449
4. Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building that were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the
time of adoption or amendment of the applicable regulations, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such buildings.
5. No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this UDC shall be erected in connection with the nonconforming use of land or
structure.
B. Change Of Use:
1. If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the Board of
Adjustment, either by general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is more appropriate to the
district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the Board of Adjustment may require appropriate conditions and
safeguards.
2. Any structure or premises, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the use
regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed.
C. Abandonment Or Cessation Of Use:
1. If a nonconforming use ceases for any reason, except when government action impedes access to the premises, on a lot or any portion of a
lot for a period of more than twelve (12) consecutive months, the nonconforming use shall be considered abandoned. Once abandoned, the
prior legal nonconforming status of the use shall be considered terminated and reestablishment of the use shall be prohibited. Any
subsequent use of the property shall comply with all applicable provisions of this title.
2. Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises, removal, or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land. The term "destruction", for the purpose of this subsection, is defined as damage to an extent of more than
fifty percent (50%) of the replacement cost at time of destruction. (Ord. 13-2018, 3-27-2018)
10-9-3: NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES:
A. Continuation Of Nonconforming Structures Generally: Nonconforming structures may continue, subject to the general provisions of section 10-
9-1 of this chapter and the following limitations:
1. No nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way that increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its nonconformity. This subsection shall not be construed to allow the expansion of a nonconforming use of structure.
2. Should a nonconforming structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the
district in which it is located after it is moved.
3. Any structure in which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use shall thereafter conform to the use regulations for the district,
and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. (Ord. 13-2018, 3-27-2018)
10-9-4: NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD:
A. Unless otherwise provided in this UDC, single-family residences and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any legally created
single lot of record existing at the time of adoption of this UDC. Such lot must have been in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage
with other lots under the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements of the district in which
it is located for area, width or both area and width; provided however, that the minimum setback requirements of the district shall be met unless
a variance to said requirements has been granted as provided herein.
B. If two (2) or more lots or combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of
adoption of this UDC, and part or all of said lots do not meet the requirements of the district in which they are located as to minimum area or
width, or both minimum area and width, for the purpose of this chapter, the lands shall be considered to be an undivided parcel, and no portion
of said parcel shall be sold or used in a manner which diminishes compliance with the lot area and width requirements established in this UDC.
(Ord. 13-2018, 3-27-2018)
10-9-5: NONCONFORMING SIGNS:

1. The size or shape of the sign is changed;
a. The sign structure is altered. Alteration does not include repairs and/or maintenance; or
b. The nonconforming sign is accessory to a nonconforming use that has lost its nonconforming status; or

the replacement cost of the sign, the sign shall be removed or brought into compliance. (Ord. 13-2018, 3-27-2018)
10-9-6: NONCONFORMING USE CHARACTERISTICS:
A. Existing Nonconforming Characteristics: If the characteristics of a use, lot, or structure such as off-street parking, off-street loading, lighting,
landscaping, or other features regulated by this UDC, are not in accord with the requirements of this UDC, no change shall be made in such
characteristics that increase the amount of nonconformity with such requirements. Change shall be permitted in the direction of conformity to
the requirements of this UDC.
B. Improvements Triggering Upgrades In Nonconforming Characteristics: If: 1) an application is filed for a building permit or for reconstruction,
remodeling, expansion, or other improvements of a multi-family, commercial, industrial, or mixed-use structure, and 2) the value of the
proposed improvements total more than twenty five percent (25%) of its replacement cost of the primary structure(s) on the property, the
applicant shall be required to address the following nonconformities prior to, or as part of the improvements authorized by, such land use permit
or building permit, unless the Community Development Director determines in writing that such nonconformities have no significant adverse

in violation. After any such order has been posted, no work shall proceed on any building, other structure, or tract of land covered by such
order, except to correct such violation or comply with the order.

UDC is a real, immediate, and irreparable injury to the public; that the public will be irreparably injured by the continuation of the violation
unless the violation is enjoined; and that there is no plain and adequate remedy at law for the subject UDC violation.
6. Abatement: The Town may abate the violation pursuant to this subsection.
a. Before action is taken to abate a violation, a final warning notice shall be posted on the property and served personally or by certified mail

abatement of any violation. The Community Development Director shall forward a bill for collection to the violator and owner of record of
the property specifying the nature and costs of the work performed. For purposes of this section, the term "incidental expenses" shall
include but not be limited to the actual expenses and costs to the Town in the preparation of the notices, specifications and contracts, work
inspection, and interest from the date of completion at the rate prescribed by law for delinquent Real Property Taxes.

upon which the abatement occurred. Such charges become a lien upon the real property upon which the violation was located. When
charges for abatement remain unpaid after thirty (30) days from billing, the Community Development Director shall record a claim of lien at
the District Recorder's Office. The lien shall be subordinate to all existing special assessment liens previously imposed upon the same
property and shall be paramount to all other liens except for State or Municipal Property Taxes, with which it shall be upon a parity. The lien
shall continue until the charges and all interest due and payable thereon are paid.

public health, safety and welfare.
I. Definitions:
CLOSED LOOP DRILLING PROCESS OR SYSTEM: A closed loop mud drilling system typically consists of steel tanks for mud mixing and
storage and the use of solids removal equipment which normally includes some combination of shale shakers, mud cleaners and centrifuges
sitting on top of the mud tanks. This equipment separates drill cutting solids from the mud stream coming out of the wellbore while retaining
the water or fluid portion to be reused to continue drilling the well bore. The solids are placed in containment, either a shallow lined pit or an
above ground container, provided on location. The system differs from conventional drilling where a reserve pit is used to allow gravitational
settling of the solids from the mud which can then be reused. A Closed Loop Drilling System does not include use of a conventional reserve
drilling pit.
DEGRADATION: Lowering in grade or desirability; lessening in quality.
DIRECTOR: Community Development Director or the Director's representative.
EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION WASTE: Those wastes associated with oil and gas operations to locate or remove oil or gas from the
ground or to remove impurities from such substances and which are uniquely associated with and intrinsic to oil and gas exploration,
development or production activities that are exempt from regulation under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).
FLARE PIT: A pit used exclusively for flaring gas.
FLOWLINES: Those segments of pipe from the wellhead downstream through the production facilities ending at:
1. In the case of gas lines, the gas metering equipment; or
2. In the case of oil lines, the oil loading point or LACT unit; or
3. In the case of water lines, the water loading point, the point of discharge to a pit, the injection wellhead, or the permitted surface water
discharge point.
GATHERING LINE: A pipeline and equipment that transports gas from a production facility (ordinarily commencing downstream of the final
production separator at the inlet flange of the custody transfer meter) to a natural gas processing plant or transmission line or main. The term
"gathering line" includes valves, metering equipment, communication equipment, cathodic protection facilities, and pig launchers and
receivers, but does not include dehydrators, treaters, tanks, separators, or compressors located downstream of the final production facilities
and upstream of the natural gas processing plants, transmission lines, or main lines.
GEOLOGIC HAZARDS: Terrain and geological traits that pose a risk of causing damage to property or human life, including subsurface
features such as fault lines, aquifers and other geothermic and geologic phenomena.
HYDRAULIC FRACTURING FLUID: The fluid, including the applicable base fluid and all hydraulic fracturing additives, used to perform a
hydraulic fracturing treatment.
HYDRAULIC FRACTURING OR HYDRAULIC FRACTURING TREATMENT: All stages of the treatment of a well by the application of
hydraulic fracturing fluid under pressure that is expressly designed to initiate or propagate fractures in a target geologic formation to enhance
production of oil and natural gas.
LINEAR FEATURE: A road, gathering line, or pipeline that is necessary to cross a water body or connect or access a well or gathering line. A
linear feature is not considered necessary simply because it is the most proximate or least expensive method for crossing a water body or
connecting or accessing a well or gathering line.
MITIGATION: The following actions, in order of preference:
1. Avoiding Impacts: Avoiding an impact by not taking a certain action or parts of an action; or
2. Minimizing Impacts: Limiting the degree or magnitude of the action or its implementation, or by changing its location; or
3. Rectifying Impacts: Repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the impact area, facility or service; or
4. Reducing Or Eliminating Impacts: Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and maintenance operations; and
5. Other Provisions For Addressing Impacts: Replacing or providing equivalent biological, social, environmental and physical conditions, or
a combination thereof.

g. To discuss whether the application will be classified as a type A or type B permit application; and
h. To identify potential operational conflicts, or waivers of oil and gas operation standards based on technical infeasibility or environmental
protection that the applicant intends to raise.
2. Pre-Application Materials: At or before the pre-application conference, the applicant shall provide the Director with information that is
sufficient for determining the location and nature of the proposed oil and gas operation, the degree of impacts associated with the operation,
and mitigation proposed to offset such impacts.
B. Classification Of Permit Application: Within ten (10) working days after the pre-application conference the Director shall classify the permit
application as a type A or type B permit application.
1. Oil And Gas Operations Classified As Type A: An oil and gas operation will be classified as a type A permit application if the operator agrees
to conduct the operation in conformance with the following requirements1.
a. The operation will be at least one thousand feet (1,000') from occupied buildings or occupied buildings permitted for construction.
b. Wells and production facilities shall be seven hundred fifty feet (750') or more from Erie platted residential lots or parks, sports fields and
playgrounds, or other designated outside activity areas.
c. The operation will be at least five hundred feet (500') from any surface water body.
d. The operation will be at least five hundred feet (500') from any domestic or commercial water wells or irrigation wells and the operation is
not located within a Floodway District as defined in subsection 10-2-7C4 of this title.
e. The operation will utilize closed-loop systems for drilling and completion operations.
f. The operator agrees to control noise levels as follows.
(1) For db(A) scale noise, operator will insure that the noise level from operations subject to the light industrial zone noise standard under
COGCC regulations 802.b and 604.c.(2)(A) does not exceed sixty (60) db(A) and that the noise level from operations subject to the
industrial zone noise standard under COGCC regulations 802.b and 604.c.(2)(A) is reduced at least five (5) db(A) below the maximum
level permitted by those regulations. For this purpose, the noise level shall be measured as set forth in COGCC regulations 802.b and c,
except no measurements shall be taken when traffic is passing the sound level meter, and operator shall be present during all
measurements. As set forth in COGCC regulation 802.b, the noise levels shall be subject to increase for a period not to exceed fifteen
(15) minutes in any one hour period and reduction for periodic, impulsive or shrill noises.
(2) For db(C) scale noise, operator shall comply with the requirements of COGCC regulation 802.
g. The operator agrees to control air quality through the following practices.
(1) To identify leaks, operator will perform audio, visual and olfactory inspections on a monthly basis at all of its new and existing wells and
related facilities and equipment within Erie's Town limits. Operator will also inspect each such well with an infra-red camera on a monthly
basis. The initial baseline inspections will occur within sixty (60) calendar days after the date of permit approval. After a well has
produced for twelve (12) months, the frequency of such inspections shall decrease from monthly to quarterly. If operator determines that
any repairs are required based on these inspections, operator will promptly initiate these repairs.
(2) Operator will report to the Director on the inspection results and any associated repairs the month after the inspection or repair occurs.
This information will be collectively reported on a monthly basis in the same format that operator uses for reporting to the Air Pollution

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=477 441/449
Control Division under regulation 7, but that is specific to wells located within the Erie Town limits. The Town will make this information
available upon its website, or may provide a link for such information from Town's website to operator's website.
(3) For each well completion operation with hydraulic fracturing, the operator will control emissions by the following procedures.
(A) For the duration of flowback, route the recovered liquids into one or more storage vessels or re-inject the recovered liquids into the
well or another well, and route the recovered gas into a gas flow line or collection system, re-inject the recovered gas into the well or
another well, use the recovered gas as an onsite fuel source, or use the recovered gas for another useful purpose that a purchased
fuel or raw material would serve, with no direct release to the atmosphere.
(B) If compliance with the prior paragraph is infeasible, the operator must capture and direct flowback emissions to a completion
combustion device equipped with a reliable continuous ignition source over the duration of flowback, except in conditions that may
result in a fire hazard or explosion, or where high heat emissions from a completion combustion device may negatively impact

completion of the work, unless otherwise agreed to by the surface owner. Permanent storage of equipment on well pad sites shall not be
allowed.
(2) Materials shall not be buried on-site.
e. The operator shall promptly reclaim and reseed all disturbed sites in conformance with COGCC rules.
f. Routine field maintenance of vehicles or mobile machinery shall not be performed within three hundred feet (300') of any water body.
g. All mechanized equipment associated with the operation shall be anchored to minimize transmission of vibrations through the ground.
h. No burning of trash shall occur in association with the operation.
i. Open-ended discharge valves on all storage tanks, pipelines and other containers shall be secured where the operation site is unattended
or is accessible to the general public. Open-ended discharge valves shall be placed within the interior of the tank secondary containment.
j. All permanent equipment with engines or motors that can be electrified shall be electrified from the power grid or from renewable sources.
All well pads that are not electrically operated should use quiet design mufflers (also referred to as hospital grade or dual dissipative) or

equivalent, as determined by the Director. The fencing color shall be bronze unless the Director approves black fencing. Black fencing will
only be approved by the Director if fencing or site furnishings in the adjacent developments have approved black elements.
m. The operator will install down cast lighting or some other form of lighting that mitigates light pollution and spill-over onto adjacent
properties; provided, however, that operator may still use lighting that is necessary for public and occupational safety.
n. The operator shall comply with any COGCC rules regarding well abandonment. Upon plugging and abandonment of a well, the operator
shall provide the Director with surveyed coordinates of the abandoned well and shall leave onsite a permanent physical marker of the well
location.
C. Waiver Of Approval Standards: The Town may waive one or more of the oil and gas operation approval standards set forth in subsection B of
this section for operational conflict, technical infeasibility or environmental protection.
1. Operational Conflict: An approval standard may be waived by the Board of Trustees if the application of a Town standard to the proposed oil
and gas operation would materially impede or destroy the State's interest in the responsible, balanced development, production and
utilization of oil and gas consistent with protection of public health, safety and welfare, including protection of the environment and wildlife
resources.
a. Request For Waiver: Upon written request by the applicant, the Director shall schedule a public hearing by the Board of Trustees at the
next regularly scheduled meeting for which proper notice can be accomplished and for which there is time on the agenda following receipt
of the written waiver request.
b. Notice Of Public Hearing:
(1) The notice of public hearing on the waiver request shall be prepared by the Director and shall include a description of the proposed oil
and gas operation, description of the standard(s) sought to be waived, and the date and location of the hearing.
(2) Not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing, the Director shall publish the notice of public hearing on the waiver request in a
newspaper having general circulation in the area. The operator shall be responsible for the cost of publication.
(3) Not less than fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the date of the public hearing on the waiver request, the Director shall mail written
notice of the public hearing to owners of real property within three hundred feet (300') of the subject parcel when the proposed oil and
gas operation is located. The applicant shall provide a stamped and addressed envelope for each party to be notified. The list of
property owners to be notified shall be compiled by the applicant using the most current list of property owners on file with the County
Assessor.
c. Decision By Board Of Trustees On Request For Waiver Of Standard: The Board of Trustees may waive the standard if the Board
determines, based on evidence and testimony at the hearing, that application of the approval standard to the proposed oil and gas
operation will result in an operational conflict with a State Statute, regulation, or other requirement. The Board may impose conditions that
are necessary to minimize any negative impacts of the waiver.

2. Technical Infeasibility: The operator may make a written request to the Director for a waiver due to technical infeasibility at any time during
the application review process prior to the final decision on the application. The Director may approve the request for waiver based upon the
following determinations:
a. There is no economical technology commercially available to conduct the proposed oil and gas operation in compliance with the standard;
and
b. Conduct of the proposed oil and gas operation if the standard is waived will be protective of public health, safety, welfare and the
environment.
3. Environmental Protection: The operator may make a written request to the Director for a waiver based on environmental protection at any
time during the application review process prior to the final decision on the application. The Director may approve the request for waiver if
protection of public health, safety, welfare and the environment will be enhanced by an alternate approach not contemplated by the standard.
