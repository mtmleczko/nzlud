Any claim for recovery shall include a properly executed release of claim from the taxpayer and/or vendor releasing its claim to the taxes paid to the wrong municipality, evidence to substantiate the claim, and a request that the municipality approve or deny in whole or in part, the claim within ninety (90) days of its receipt.

Section 5-2-18. Recovery of Unpaid Tax by Action at Law.

(a)
Action at Law. The Director may also treat any such taxes, penalties, or interest due and unpaid as a debt due the City from the taxpayer personally. In case of failure to pay the tax, or any portion thereof, or any penalty or interest thereon when due, the Director may receive at law the amount of such taxes, penalties, interest and collection costs in such county or district court of the county wherein venue may be proper under the applicable rule of civil procedure. The return of the taxpayer or the assessment made by the Director as herein provided, shall be prima facie proof of the amount due.

(b)
Writs of Attachment. Such actions may be actions in attachment, and writs of attachment may be issued to the sheriff and in any such proceedings, no bond shall be required of the Director nor shall any sheriff require of the Director an indemnifying bond for executing the writ of attachment, or writ of execution upon any judgment entered in such proceedings; and the Director may prosecute appeals or writs of error, in such cases without the necessity of providing bond therefor. It shall be the duty of the City Attorney, when requested by the Director, to commence action for the recovery of taxes due under this Code, and this remedy shall be in addition to all other existing remedies or remedies provided in this Code.

(c)
Civil Action to Enforce Lien Against Real Property. In any case where there has been a refusal or neglect to pay any tax due the City, the Director may cause a civil action to be filed in the district court of the county in which is situated any real property which is subject to said tax, to enforce the lien of the City for such tax upon the real property situated in that county or in any other county in the state which may be subject to such lien or to subject any real property or any right, title or interest in real property to the payment of such tax. The court shall decree a sale of such real property and distribute the proceeds of such sale, according to the findings of such court in respect to the interest of the parties and of the City; the proceedings in such action and the manner of sale, the period for and manner of redemption from such sale and the execution of deed of conveyance shall be in accordance with the law and practice relating to foreclosures of mortgages upon real property. In any such action, the court may appoint a receiver of the real property involved in such action if equity so requires.

(d)

The goods, stock-in-trade, and business fixtures of or used by any taxpayer under lease, title-retaining contract or other contractual arrangement; and

(b)
Whenever the business or property of any taxpayer subject to this Code shall be placed in receivership, bankruptcy or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or seized under distraint for property or other taxes, all taxes, penalties and interest imposed by this Code and for which said person is in any way liable under the terms of this Code, shall be a prior and preferred lien against all the property of said taxpayer, and no sheriff, receiver, assignee or other officer shall sell the property of any person subject to this Code under process or order of any court, without first ascertaining from the Director the amount of any taxes due and payable under this Code. If there be any such taxes due, owing or unpaid, it shall be the duty of such officer to first pay the amount of said taxes out of the proceeds of said sale before making payment of any moneys to judgment creditors or other claims of whatsoever nature.

(c)
At any time a tax has accrued but is unpaid, the Director may issue a notice of tax lien, setting forth the name of the taxpayer, the amount of the tax, penalties and interest, the date of the accrual thereof, and that the City claims a first and prior lien therefore on the real and tangible personal property of the taxpayer. Said notice may be filed in the office of the Clerk and Recorder of any county in the state in which the taxpayer owns real or tangible personal property. Issuance of such notice and filing thereof shall be at the discretion of the Director and shall not affect the priority or validity of the lien provided by this Code, which arises by operation of law when the tax accrues and is payable.

(d)
Any representative of the Director to whom a Distraint Warrant has been issued may file a Notice of Lien in such forms as the Director may prescribe with the person in possession of any personal property or rights to property belonging to the taxpayer if not previously recorded with the County Clerk and Recorder. The Director may release said lien as to any part or all of the property or rights to property covered by such lien upon such terms as he may deem proper.

(e)
Any lien for taxes as shown on the records of the County Clerks and Recorders as herein provided, upon payment of all taxes, penalties, and interest covered thereby, shall be released by the Director in the same manner as mortgages and judgments are released.

(b)
Compromise Record.

(a)
Alcoholic Beverage Sales by the Drink and Vending Machine Sales of Tangible Personal Property. Any retailer selling malt, vinous or spirituous liquors by the drink or vending machine sales may include in his sales price the tax levied under this section; provided, that no such retailer shall advertise or hold out to the public in any manner, directly or indirectly, that such tax is not included as part of the sales price to the consumers. The schedule set forth in Section 5-3-3 of this Code shall be used by such retailer in determining amounts to be included in such sales price. No such retailer shall gain any benefit from the collection or payment of such tax except as permitted in subsection 5-3-7(d) nor shall the use of the schedule set forth in Section 5-3-3 of this Code relieve such retailer from liability for payment of the full amount of the tax levied by this Section.

Every retailer or vendor conducting a business in which the transaction between the vendor and the consumer or purchaser consists of the supply of tangible personal property and services in connection with the maintenance or servicing of same, shall be required to pay the tax levied under this Code upon the full contract price, unless application is made to the Director of Finance for permission to use a percentage basis for reporting the tangible personal property sold and the services supplied under such contract. The Director of Finance is hereby authorized to determine the percentage based upon the ratio of the tangible personal property included in the consideration as it bears to the total of the consideration paid under said combination contract or sale which shall be subject to the tax levied pursuant to the provisions of this Code. This Section shall not be construed to include terms upon which the tax is imposed on the full purchase price as defined in Section 5-3-4(a)(41) of this Code, nor shall it be construed as an allowance for the vendor to fail to itemize to the customer the taxable and non-taxable portions of the bill.

Provided, that if the non-resident vendor petitions the Director of Finance stating that the imposition of the tax on an individual sales basis will impose an unnecessary hardship, and if the type and occasion of sale so warrants, the Director may accept payment of that vendor's tax liability on regularly audited and reasonable estimated payment basis. This estimated payment will be based on the surveyed Northglenn Sales and Use Tax liability as it bears to the vendor's aggregate gross sales and services.

(d)
Contractor Estimated Payment Basis. Satisfaction in full of Northglenn Sales and Use Taxes "Estimated Payment Basis," based on the percentage of construction valuation as herein set forth in Section 5-3-10 shall be allowed.

(c)
Reporting Periods. If the accounting methods regularly employed by the vendor or licensed consumer in the transaction of his business, or other conditions, are such that the returns aforesaid made on a calendar month basis, will impose unnecessary hardship, the Director of Finance may upon request of the vendor, or licensed consumer, accept returns at such intervals as will, in his opinion, better suit the convenience of the taxpayer and will not jeopardize the collection of the tax; provided, however, the Director of Finance may by rule permit a vendor or licensed consumer whose monthly tax collected is less than one hundred ($100) to make returns and pay taxes at intervals not greater than(3) three months, or as approved by the Director of Finance.

In the case of a newly established business, an amount which represents the good faith determination by the applicant and the City as to the amount of sales taxes which could be generated from the new business without the participation by applicant in the ESTIP.

(b)
The phrase "owner or applicant" shall mean the record owner or potential owner of the project.

[Source: Ord. 1451, 2006]

Section 5-12-4. Eligibility. Participation in ESTIP shall be based upon approval by the City Council of the City of Northglenn, exercising its legislative discretion in good faith. Any owner or applicant of a newly established or proposed retail business, or the owner or applicant of an existing retail business which wishes to expand substantially, may apply to the City for inclusion within the ESTIP provided that the new or expanded business is reasonably likely to generate enhanced or increased sales taxes.

[Source: Ord. 1451, 2006]

The time period in which said enhanced sales taxes may be shared shall not commence until all improvements are completed and meet City standards, and shall be limited by the City Council, in its discretion, to a specified time, or until an amount of enhanced sales taxes specified in the Agreement required by Section 5-12-10 hereof has been collected.

Section 5-12-6. Obligations on Participants.

Section 5-12-7. Administration. The base figure for sales taxes shall be divided into monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annual increments as determined by the City, which increments are subject to agreement between the parties, and approval by the City Council, and which increments shall be reasonably related to the average performance of the business or property in question, or similar businesses in the area (i.e., adjusted for seasonal variations) for the incremental period. If in any incremental period the agreed base amount is not met by an owner or proprietor and, thus, no enhanced sales taxes are generated for that incremental period, no funds shall be shared with the owner or proprietor for said incremental period, and no increment shall be shared until that deficit, and any other cumulative deficit, has been met, so that at the end of the term of the Agreement, funds in excess of those "enhanced sales taxes" agreed to be shared shall not have been shared with any owner or proprietor.

Section 5-12-8. Accounting.

(b)
It shall be the affirmative duty of the Treasurer of the City of Northglenn to collect and escrow such "enhanced sales taxes" payable to the owner or applicant in a separate account apart from the sales taxes generated by, and collect from, any other sales tax generating sources within the City and to provide an accounting system which accomplishes the overriding purpose of this Section 5-12-8. Interest earnings on such account shall accrue to the City. Such funds shall not be considered City funds for purposes of any ordinance or resolution allocating sales tax monies from particular sources to particular purposes but shall be applied exclusively to this Program.

(c)
The City Council of the City of Northglenn conclusively states that this Article 12 would not be adopted or implemented but for the provisions of this Section 5-12-8.

Any vehicle or personal property, including fixtures and contents of a structure or building, currency, securities, or negotiable instruments which has been or is being used in any of the acts specified in Section 6-13-2 or in, upon, or by means of which any act under said section has taken or is taking place; or any currency, negotiable instruments, securities, or other things of value furnished or intended to be furnished by, any person in exchange for any of the acts listed in Section 6-13-2; or any proceeds traceable to the acts listed in Section 6-13-2; or any currency, negotiable instruments, or securities used or intended to be used to facilitate any of the acts listed in Section 6-13-2 are contraband property and shall be seized as well as any contraband article. Any peace officer or agent of the police department may seize and hold such property or articles if there is probable cause to believe that such property or articles are contraband and the seizure is incident to a lawful search. All rights and interest in and title to contraband property shall immediately vest in the City of Northglenn upon seizure by the police department, subject only to perfection of title, rights, and interests in accordance with this article. Neither replevin nor any other action to recover any interest in such property shall be an affirmative defense or be allowed to negate a forfeiture action as provided in this article.

(b)
It shall be an affirmative defense in a forfeiture proceeding brought pursuant to this article if the owner of such property establishes by a preponderance of the evidence:

(1)

(i)
That the property had been taken from him and used without his consent, express or implied; or

(ii)
That he was uninvolved in the acts listed in Section 6-13-2 and neither knew nor reasonably should have known of those acts; and

(2)
That he had done all that reasonably should have been done to prevent the use of the property in connection with said acts.

(c)
No bona fide lienholder's interest shall be forfeited under the provisions of this article if such lienholder establishes that he neither knew nor should have known after a reasonable inquiry that such property was being used or was likely to be used for any act specified in Section 6-13-2, that such use was without his consent, express or implied, and that the lien had been perfected in the manner prescribed by law prior to such seizure. The City attorney shall set forth in the petition initiating the forfeiture action the existence of any liens and whether forfeiture of any liens will be sought. If forfeiture of a lien is not sought, the lienholder need not appear to preserve his interest. If it appears to the satisfaction of the court that a lienholder's interest satisfies the above requirements for exemption, such lienholder's interest shall be preserved by the court by ordering the lienholder's interest to be paid by the City or from such proceeds of the sale as provided in Section 6-13-5.

If the court orders the property forfeited and perfects the City's right and interest in and title to such property, the City's right, interest or title shall relate back to the date of seizure. If the court orders that the property shall be sold in the manner provided for in Section 6-12-6 of this Municipal Code, the proceeds of such sale shall be applied as follows:

(1)
First to the payment of reasonable fees and costs of the sale;

(2)

(3)
Third to the treasury of the City of Northglenn.

(b)
Moneys allocated to the treasury pursuant to subsection (a)(3) of this section including accrued interest thereon, shall not be considered a source of revenue to meet the City's normal operating needs but shall, instead, be specially accounted for, placed in a special trust fund, and used by the Police Department for purposes reasonably related to drug enforcement.

(c)
If another law enforcement agency was substantially involved in effecting the forfeiture, the other agency and the police department shall enter into a stipulation with regard to costs incurred by the parties and the percentage of any remaining proceeds which shall be deposited for the benefit of the respective parties, and, upon filing such stipulation with the court, the court shall order the proceeds so distributed. If the parties are unable to reach an agreement, the court shall take testimony and equitably distribute the proceeds.

(d)
If the court finds that a vehicle or personal property forfeited pursuant to this article can be used for law enforcement purposes by the police department, the court shall order that the vehicle or personal property be delivered to the City instead of sold, to be used by the police department for purposes reasonably related to drug enforcement. Should such property no longer be of use to the police department it may, with the approval of the City Manager, be transferred to another City department which shall reimburse the trust fund established pursuant to subsection (b) above, in an amount equal to the reasonable value of the property as established by the City Manager. If more than one law enforcement agency was substantially involved in effecting the forfeiture, the priority for receiving such vehicle or personal property shall be established by stipulation pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.

(e)
If the court orders that a vehicle be delivered to the City pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, the court shall make such Order in writing. Such Order shall direct that title in the vehicle vest in the City upon the satisfaction by the City of any liens against such vehicle. Thereafter, the City attorney shall make application for a certificate of title for such motor vehicle pursuant to section 42-6-114, C.R.S. (Suppl. 1988, as amended.)

(f)
Any forfeited money or currency shall be in addition to the proceeds obtained from sale of forfeited personal property and shall be equitably distributed pursuant to subsections (a) and (c) of this section unless such money or currency has a value in excess of its face value which shall be disposed of in accordance with Section 6-12-6 of the Municipal Code.

Section 6-13-9. Severability. If any provision of this article is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional, the remaining provisions of this article are valid, unless it appears to the court that the valid provisions of this article are so essentially and inseparably connected with, and so dependent upon, the void provision that it cannot be presumed that the City Council would have enacted the valid provisions without the void provision or unless the court determines that the valid provisions, standing alone, are incomplete and are incapable of being executed in accordance with the legislative intent of this article.

Section 7-1-14. Use of Red Light Cameras.

(a)
The City of Northglenn Police Department is authorized to use red-light cameras within the City of Northglenn to detect violations of section 603 of the Model Traffic Code at signalized intersections.

(b)
As used in this section, red-light camera shall mean a device operated by a peace officer, or by a contractor designated by the City, that is placed in a fixed location at a signalized intersection and that is programmed to automatically produce photographs depicting any vehicle whose driver has violated the provisions of section 603 at that intersection. The photographs shall depict the vehicle's location at the intersection, the vehicle's license plate, and the driver of the vehicle. Printed on the photographs shall be the date of the violation, the approximate time of the violation, the approximate location of the violation, and the speed of the vehicle.

(c)
When a peace officer, based on evidence obtained in whole or part by means of a red-light camera, has probable cause to believe that a vehicle has been driven in violation of section 603, the peace officer may issue, or cause to be issued through a contractor designated by the City, a summons and complaint charging the person in whose name the vehicle is registered with violations of section 603. If, however, the vehicle is registered in more than one person's name, the summons and complaint shall be issued to that registrant who the issuing peace officer determines, under all the facts and circumstances, was the person most likely depicted in the photographs produced by the red-light camera. The summons and complaint shall contain the signature, or reasonable facsimile thereof, of the peace officer issuing the summons and complaint.

(d)
In order to obtain personal jurisdiction in municipal court over the person charged in the summons and complaint, a copy of the summons and complaint issued under this section must be personally served upon the person charged with the violation of section 603 or, in lieu of such personal service, by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint at the charged person's usual place of abode with some person over the age of eighteen (18) years residing therein, or by mailing a copy to the charged person's last known address by certified mail, return receipt requested, within ninety (90) days after the alleged violation occurred and not less than five (5) days prior to the time the charged person is required pursuant to the summons and complaint to appear in municipal court. The person charged may waive service of the summons and complaint by voluntarily submitting to the court's jurisdiction, through payment of a fine or other affirmative act constituting a waiver of service.

(e)
When a person is served with a summons and complaint under this section, the person shall:

(1)
If admitting the charge, complete the summons and complaint form by providing his or her driver's license number and other pertinent information requested in the form, and return the completed summons and complaint form, together with payment of the fine assessed, to the municipal court on or before the time specified in the summons and complaint for the charged person to appear in court; or

(2)
If contesting the charge, appear in municipal court at the time specified in the summons and complaint for arraignment.

(f)
Proof that a particular vehicle entered an intersection in violation of section 603 as detected by a red-light camera and as shown by the photographs produced by the red-light camera, together with proof that the particular vehicle is registered in the charged person's name, shall raise the evidentiary presumption and constitute prima facie evidence in any prosecution of a violation under this section of the fact that the charged person was the person driving the vehicle depicted in the photograph. However, such evidence and presumption may be rebutted by the presentation of any probative and competent evidence that the charged person was not the driver shown in the photograph. The City may not require a registered owner of a vehicle to disclose the identity of a driver who was detected through by the use of the red-light camera. However, the owner may be required to submit evidence that the owner was not the driver at the time of the alleged violation.

(g)
In any proceeding in the municipal court to prosecute a violation of this section 603, any photograph produced by a red-light camera concerning the violation shall be admissible in court as prima facie evidence of a violation of section 603, provided that the peace officer who activated and tested the red-light camera prior to the photographs being taken testifies as to the placement of the red-light camera and the accuracy of the scene depicted in the photographs, and further testifies that he or she tested the red-light camera for proper operation within a reasonable period of time both before and after the taking of the photographs. Also, to be admissible in municipal court, the photographs must be of a sufficient quality to permit identification of the driver of the vehicle.

(h)
In any proceeding under this section, the court may impose, as an additional cost, the cost of service of the summons and complaint upon the defendant, if such service is effected through either certified mail or personal service as set forth in the Colorado Municipal Court Rules of Procedure. The court may impose the actual cost of such service so long as the costs are reasonable and do not exceed the amount actually charged for civil service of process.

(i)
The City may not report to the Department of Revenue any conviction, entry of judgment, outstanding judgment, or warrant based on a violation of section 603, which was detected exclusively by means of a red-light camera. The department does not have the authority to assess any points against a license if a violation is detected through the use of a red-light camera. Furthermore, the department may not keep any record of such violation in the official records maintained by the department.

(j)
The maximum penalty for a violation of section 603 that is detected by a red-light camera, including surcharge, is seventy-five dollars ($75.00).

(k)
If a driver fails to pay a penalty imposed for a violation detected by using a red-light camera, the City of Northglenn may not attempt to enforce such penalty by immobilizing the driver's vehicle.

(l)
No portion of any fine collected for a violation discovered by use of a red-light camera may be paid to the manufacturer or vendor of the red-light camera. The compensation paid by the City of Northglenn for such equipment shall be based on the value of such equipment and may not be based upon the number of traffic citations issued or the revenue generated by such equipment.

W = Overall gross weight on any group of two or more consecutive axles to the nearest five hundred pounds.

L = Distance in feet between first and last axles of such vehicle or combination of vehicles.

Section 9-11-5. Authorized Inspector Entry Upon Property.

(a)
Right of entry--generally. Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the provisions of this Chapter, or whenever an authorized inspector has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any building or upon any premises any condition which constitutes a nuisance hereunder, such inspector may enter such building or premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same or to perform any duty imposed on him; provided, that if such building or premises is occupied, such inspector shall first present proper credentials and request entry; and if such building or premises is unoccupied, he shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or occupant or other person or persons having charge or control of the building or premises, and upon locating the owner, occupant or other person or persons shall present proper credentials and request entry. If entry is refused, such person shall give the owner or occupant, or if the owner or occupant cannot be located after a reasonable effort, he shall leave at the building or premises, a twenty-four hours' written notice of intention to inspect. The notice given to the owner or occupant or left on the premises as aforesaid shall state that the property owner has the right to refuse entry and that in the event such entry is refused, inspection may be made only upon issuance of a search warrant by a municipal judge of the City, or judge of any other court having jurisdiction.

After the expiration of the twenty-four hour period from the giving or leaving of such notice, the authorized inspector may appear before any Municipal Judge of the Municipal Court of the City and upon a showing of probable cause shall obtain a search warrant entitling him to enter the building or the premises. Upon presentation of the search warrant and proper credentials, or possession of same in the case of an unoccupied building or premises, the person may enter into the building or the premises using such reasonable force as may be necessary to gain entry therein.

For purposes of this subsection, a determination of "Probable Cause" will be based upon reasonableness, and if a valid public interest justifies the intrusion contemplated, then there is probably cause to issue a search warrant. The person applying for such warrant shall not be required to demonstrate personal knowledge of the condition of the particular structure or premises in issue in order to obtain a search warrant. It is unlawful for any owner or occupant of the building or premises to resist reasonable force used by an authorized inspector, acting pursuant to this subsection.

(b)
Right of entry--emergencies. Whenever an emergency situation exists in relation to the enforcement of any of the provisions of this Chapter, an authorized inspector upon a presentation of proper credentials or identification, in the case of an occupied building or premises, or possession of the credentials in the case of an unoccupied building or premises, may enter into any building or any premises within the jurisdiction of the City. In the emergency situation such person or his authorized representative may use such reasonable force as may be necessary to gain entry into the building or the premises.

For purposes of this subsection, an emergency situation includes any situation where there is imminent danger of loss of life, limb or property. It is unlawful for any owner or occupant of the building or premises to resist reasonable force used by the authorized official acting pursuant to this subsection.

(c)
Search warrants -- Jurisdiction of the Municipal Court. Any Municipal Judge of the Municipal Court of the City shall have power to issue search warrants upon a showing of probable cause for the implementations as provided for in Subsection (a) of this section.

(2)
As to other nuisances the reasonable time for abatement shall not exceed seven (7) days unless it appears from the facts and circumstances that compliance could not reasonable be made within seven (7) days or that a good faith attempt at compliance is being made. Provided further that if the owner or occupant shall fail to comply with the requirements for a period longer than that named in the notice, then the City Manager shall proceed to have the nuisance described in the notice removed or abated from the property described in the notice without delay; and the City Manager shall have the authority to call for any necessary assistance.

Section 9-11-9. Abatement Procedures. After issuance of a notice as provided in Section 9-11-7 of this article:

(a)
Follow up Procedures to Notice.

(1)
The inspector shall conduct a follow up inspection of the property within the timeframe set in the notice for correction of the violation. If the nuisance has been corrected, no further action shall be taken by the inspector. If the nuisance has not been corrected, the inspector shall determine the appropriate enforcement action.

(2)
If the nuisance constitutes an imminent danger to life, safety or welfare, the City may summarily abate the nuisance without further notice.

(3)
For nuisances not subject to subsection (2) above, the inspector may take the following enforcement actions:

(A)
Issue an administrative citation requiring payment of a designated fine, as prescribed by the fine schedule adopted by City Council. If contact is not made with the property owner, the inspector shall send a copy of the citation via certified mail to the property owner. Abatement of the nuisance shall not waive the fine in the citation. If the nuisance is not abated by the payment date of the fine, the inspector may issue another citation with a graduated fine or issue a summons and complaint as described in this section. If, after the third citation, the owner or occupant has not contacted the inspector or corrected the nuisance and paid the administrative fines imposed, the inspector may issue a summons or abate the nuisance as appropriate.

(B)
Issue a summons and complaint for the violation, which may be served in person or through certified mail.

(C)
Issue a written notice to show cause to the owner or occupant pursuant to section (4) below.

(D)
Abate the nuisance as described in Section 9-11-11.

(4)
Notwithstanding the commencement of any criminal prosecution alleging a violation of the Code or the lack of such criminal prosecution, the notice to show cause shall indicate that a hearing shall be held on a specified date to show cause why the nuisance shall not be removed or eliminated by the City in accordance with this Chapter. If the owner or occupant has been issued three (3) written notices to a property for the same nuisance within any twelve (12) month period or the owner or occupant is currently subject to a deferred judgment agreement or probation agreement on the same nuisance, the inspector may issue a notice to show cause immediately. If it reasonably appears to the inspector that the property is abandoned or unoccupied or if the property is subject to a foreclosure proceeding, the inspector may immediately issue a notice to show cause.

(A)
The notice to show cause, referred to in subsection (4), shall describe the condition that is a nuisance, shall state that the owner or occupant of the property may be subject to assessment for all costs associate with abatement of the nuisance by the City and shall be personally served upon the owner and occupant of the property. If diligent efforts to serve the notice personally are unsuccessful, it shall be deemed sufficient notice; if the notice to show cause is mailed by certified mail to the owner of the real property, as shown by the Adams County Assessor's Office, and to the occupant at the real property address. For property owners who do not reside in Colorado, notice will also be sent by certified mail. If notice is mailed, a copy of the notice to show cause shall also be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises where the nuisance is found. No further notice shall be necessary.

(B)
At the hearing referred to above, the City Manager, or a designee, shall hear such statements and consider such evidence as the inspector, the owner or occupant, or any other witness shall offer relative to the existence of and removal or elimination of the nuisance. The burden of proof is upon the City to establish that the nuisance exists on the property by a preponderance of the evidence. If the City is seeking a continuing order, as authorized by subsection (C) herein, evidence shall be presented establishing the public necessity for such order which evidence may include, but not be limited to, that the property subject to the order is vacant property, foreclosed property, abandoned property or property where the owner has demonstrated a pattern of repeatedly failing to comply with administrative orders. The hearing shall be an administrative hearing where the strict rules of evidence shall not be adhered to and hearsay shall be admitted. However, any decision with regard to the nuisance on the property shall not be based solely on hearsay evidence.

(C)
The City Manager or a designee shall issue an order based on the findings of fact made pursuant to the hearing either relieving the owner or occupant of any responsibility by finding that no nuisance exists on the real property, or commanding the owner or occupant to abate the nuisance within a reasonable time and thereby rehabilitating the property. Any continuing order issued shall remain in effect for one year from the date of such order requiring the owner of the property to maintain the property in compliance with the specific requirements identified in the continuing order.

(D)
The order of the City Manager, or a designee, made pursuant to subsection (C) above, shall be a final decision and may be appealed to the District Court pursuant to Colorado Rule of Civil Procedure 106(a)(4). Failure of an owner or occupant to appeal said order constitutes a knowing waiver of any right to contest the City's order and consequential authority to abate the nuisance from the owner's property, and charge the resulting costs to the property owner.

(E)
If any order issued by the City Manager, or a designee, pursuant to subsection (C) above has not been complied with, within the designated time frame contained in the order, the City, at the direction of the City Manager, or a designee, may cause the abatement of the nuisance as specifically identified in the order and any continuing order issued may authorize the City to eliminate such conditions so long as the order is in effect and so long as the property is owned by the same owner identified in the order.

(F)
Any such owner or occupant who fails to comply with an order issued by the City Manager, or a designee, pursuant to subsection (C) above, shall be charged with all administrative costs and expenses incurred in the abatement of the nuisance. Such administrative costs shall include the cost of said abatement, inspection fees, postal charges, legal expenses, and other expenses as related to the enforcement of the order.

(G)
Once the costs for abatement are determined pursuant to subsection (F) above, the City shall send out a notice of payment due ("Notice") for such costs to the owner or occupant, if different than the owner, of the property upon which the abatement occurred advising of those costs and that payment needs to be made within 30 days from the date of the notice. Failure to pay in accordance with the notice may result in the collection of such costs as allowed by this Chapter and shall constitute a lien against the property.

(b)
Upon the filing of a protest as provided in the notice, the period of notice shall be extended until final disposition of the protest plus ten (10) days.

ASBESTOS CONTROL
Section 10-12-1. Title. This Article 12 of Chapter 10 of the Municipal Code shall be known and cited as the Northglenn Asbestos Control Ordinance.

[Source: Ord. 864, 1987]

Section 10-12-2. Legislative Declaration. The City Council hereby finds that exposure to airborne asbestos fibers and particles has been linked by reputable medical and scientific authorities to a significant increase in the incidence of diseases such as asbestosis, bronchogenic carcinoma, mesothelioma, and other malignancies and that substantial amounts of materials containing asbestos have been used in buildings for fireproofing, insulation, soundproofing, decorative and other purposes. The Council further finds that the predominant cause of asbestos becoming airborne is due to the performance of building renovation and demolition without adequate procedures for the removal, transport, storage and disposal of asbestos material for the protection of workers and the general public. Therefore, it is the purpose of this ordinance to safeguard the public health by establishing certain requirements as to the removal, transportation, storage and disposal of materials containing asbestos.

Section 10-14-6. Testing Procedures. Method to conduct the tests:

(a)
Measurements shall be made using the following guidelines:

(1)
Each measurement shall be made using a portable radio in general use by each emergency-service-provider agency, which agencies minimally include the Police department and the Fire department. Any digital, non-simplex channel programmed into such radio may be used during testing; the same channel need not be used for all tests.

(2)
Portable radios used in testing shall not be displaying "Low Battery" indications.

(3)
During Test Transmissions, the portable radio shall be held approximately two (2) inches from the mouth of the tester, at approximately a 45-degree angle with the tester's with the built-in microphone and speaker directed towards the tester's mouth, and with the antenna in a vertical orientation above the radio. The antenna of each radio shall be mounted directly on the top of the radio body/case. The built-in microphone shall be used for all testing; shoulder or other attached microphones/headsets shall not be used for testing.

(4)
The tester shall orient himself or herself so as to be facing towards the exterior wall of the building nearest the point of the test.

(5)
Both initial and annual tests shall be conducted by persons employed by the Emergency-Service-Provider Agency. At least one tester from the Police department and one tester from the Fire department shall conduct initial and annual tests, unless alternate arrangements are approved by both agencies.

(6)
Each tester shall be solely responsible for determining whether or not radio messages received in the building are intelligible; the dispatcher at the Emergency-Agency Dispatch Center shall be solely responsible for determining whether or not radio messages received in the dispatch center are intelligible. An unintelligible message constitutes a failure of the test at the specific location being tested (see below).

(7)
The tester in the building shall initiate each test by attempting to transmit a message to the Dispatch Center. Failure to receive a reply from the dispatch center constitutes a failure of the test at the specific location being tested.

(8)
The tester in the building shall exercise reasonableness and discretion in the conduct of all tests. If the tester believes a particular test is not valid (e.g., is flawed by human error), then the results of that test may be discarded and the test shall be repeated.

(b)
Initial tests.

(1)
Each floor of the structure shall be divided into 100-foot grids, and testing shall be performed at the center of each grid. In critical areas, including (but not limited to) those areas enumerated in section 10-14-4(c)(2), the grids shall be reduced to 25 feet. At least one test shall be conducted at the center of every room having a use identified in section 10-14-4(c)(2)b or 10-14-4(c)(2)c. The size of the grids may also be further reduced upon recommendation of any tester in areas where displays, equipment, stock, or any other obstruction may significantly affect communications or attenuate radio signals.

(2)
A test shall be performed on every landing within vertical exit enclosures.

(c)
Annual tests.

(1)
Annual tests will be conducted by both the Fire department and the Police department. If the communications appear to have degraded or if the testing fails to demonstrate adequate system performance, the owner of the building or structure shall remedy the problem and restore the system in a manner consistent with the original approval criteria.

(2)
If the degradation to the system is due to building additions or remodeling, the owner of the building or structure is required to remedy the problem and restore the system in a manner consistent with the original approval criteria in order to obtain a final inspection for occupancy.

(3)
Any system degradation or failure not related to the performance of the owner's on-site system will be the responsibility of the appropriate emergency service agency.

To ensure that zoning decisions are directed toward achievement of community goals and objectives, as embodied in the adopted Master Development Plan, rather than satisfying arbitrary minimum standards.

(2)
To recognize the unique nature of each parcel of land and allow flexibility in the planning and design response.

(3)
To encourage and promote innovation in land development by allowing more variety in type, design, layout, and architectural design of buildings and site amenities.

(4)
To ensure that proposed rezonings and specific proposals presented to staff and the Planning Commission are constructed as presented and not used merely as a tool to facilitate property sale or some other transfer of real estate to make it more marketable.

(5)
To encourage economic development to expand the City's tax base and provide employment opportunities.

(6)
To create a PUD ordinance that streamlines, consolidates and simplifies zoning and subdivision, an ordinance that expedites rather than hinders the development process.

(7)
To allow for the preservation of natural site amenities such as mature trees, water bodies and channels, exceptional views, etc.

(8)
To promote the judicious use of open space and landscaped areas with regard to utility and visual impact.

(9)
To encourage a harmonious and integrated mix of land uses and require compatibility between new and existing development.

(10)
To provide for the efficient and safe movement of vehicular and pedestrian traffic on both public and private roadways.

Section 11-16-3. Application.

For purposes of this Section, new development and redevelopment projects shall be as defined in Section 11-6-15 of this Zoning Ordinance.

Section 11-40-13. Reservation for Future Acquisition for Public Streets.

(a)
Recommendations and Hearing. The Commission is empowered, after it shall have adopted a major street plan of the territory within its subdivision jurisdiction or of any major section or district thereof, from time to time, to make or cause to be made surveys for the exact location of the lines of a street or streets in any portion of such territory and to make a plat of the area or district thus surveyed, showing the land which it recommends to be reserved for future acquisition for public streets. The Commission, before adopting any such plat, shall hold a public hearing thereon, notice of the time and place of which, with a general description of the district or area covered by the plat, shall be given not less than 10 days previous to the time fixed therefore by one publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of Northglenn or of general circulation in the County of Adams if the district or area be outside the City of Northglenn. After such a hearing, the Commission may transmit the plat, as originally made or modified as may be determined by the Commission, to the Council, together with the Commission's estimate of the time in which the land shown on the plat as street locations should be acquired by the City of Northglenn. Thereupon, by resolution, the Council may approve and adopt or may reject such plat or may modify it with the approval of the Commission, or, in the event of the Commission's disapproval, the Council by a favorable vote of not less than two-thirds of its entire membership may modify such plat and adopt the modified plat. In the resolution of adoption of a plat, the Council shall fix the period of time for which the street locations shown upon the plat shall be deemed reserved for future taking or acquisition for public use. Upon such adoption, the City Clerk shall transmit one attested copy of the plat to the County Clerk and Recorder of the County of Adams and retain one copy for the purpose of public examination and hearings of claims for compensation. Such approval and adoption of a plat shall not, however, be deemed the opening or establishment of any street, nor the taking of any land for street purposes, nor for public use, nor as a public improvement, but solely as a reservation of the street location shown therein, for the period specified in the Council resolution, for future taking or acquisition for public use. The Commission, at any time, may negotiate for or secure from the owners of any such lands releases of claims for damages or compensation for such reservations or agreements indemnifying the City of Northglenn from such claims by others, which releases or agreements shall be binding on the owners executing the same and their successors in title. At any time after the filing of the plat with the County Clerk and Recorder of the County of Adams, and during the period specified for the reservation, the Commission and the owner of any land containing the reserved street location may agree upon the modification of the location of the lines of the proposed street, such agreement is to include a release by said owner of any claim for compensation of damages by reason of such modification. Thereupon the Commission may make a plat corresponding to the modification and transmit an attested copy thereof to the County Clerk and Recorder of the County of Adams, and said modified plat shall take the place of the original plat. At any time, the Council, by resolution, may abandon any reservation and shall certify any such abandonment to the County Clerk and Recorder of the County of Adams.

(b)
Compensation for Reservations. In the resolution of adoption of a plat, the Council shall appoint a board of three appraisers and shall fix the time and place of meetings for hearing by said Board upon the amounts of compensation to be paid for such reservations. Thereupon the City Clerk shall publish in at least two newspapers of general circulation in the City of Northglenn once a week for four consecutive weeks a notice which shall contain a general description of the land thus reserved, as shown on the plat, the provisions of the resolution of Council including the period of time for which such reservations are made, the time in which claims for compensation may be filed, which shall not be less than three months nor more than six months from the date of notice, and the time and place of hearings by the Board of Appraisers. The first hearing shall not be set earlier than 30 days after the date of the first of such publications. Such notice shall also be posted in at least three public places in the neighborhood of or along the line of the location of the reservation. The Board of Appraisers shall fix the amounts of compensation to be paid, respectively, to the owners of lands reserved for the period of time as shown on the plat and in the resolution adopted by the Council. Whenever the City Clerk receives, within the period fixed for the same, any claim of such compensation, he shall transmit it to the Board of Appraisers. At the time and place fixed for such hearings the Board of Appraisers shall hear and consider all claims presented to it in writing or in person, including all evidence which may be presented by the claimants or other persons. The Board of Appraisers shall have the right on its own initiative to investigate and ascertain data or evidence relevant to the question of such compensation. In case of the abandonment of a reservation prior to the time fixed for payment of compensation, the City of Northglenn shall be liable to the owner of land included within the abandoned reservations for the expenses, if any, incurred by such owner by reason of such reservation.

(c)
Report of Appraisers -- Action By Council. The Board of Appraisers, within 90 days after the time fixed for filing the claims, shall file its tentative report with the City Clerk, setting forth its findings as to amounts of compensation to be paid to the respective owners of the land included within the lines of such reservations as located on the approved plat. Thereupon the City Clerk shall publish once a week for two consecutive weeks in at least two newspapers of general circulation in the City of Northglenn the fact of the filing of the report of the appraisers and specify a period of 30 days after the date of the first such publication within which objections to the report may be filed with the City Clerk. If objections are filed within said period, then the City Clerk shall cause the Board of Appraisers to hold a meeting, at which said objections shall be transmitted to the Board, and the Board may modify its report. The report in its original form, or if modified, in its modified form, shall be transmitted to the Council by the City Clerk. Before passing on the report, the Council may return it to the Board of Appraisers for reconsideration, and the Board may upon further consideration transmit its formal or modified report to the Council. The Council may approve or disapprove the report. If the report is approved by the Council, the Council shall provide for the payment of the amounts of compensation set forth in the report within 90 days after the filing of the report with the Council. In the case of those property owners who file claims, payment shall be made through the City Clerk, who shall notify the claimants at the addresses given upon the claims filed with him. Payments to all other persons shall be made through the Clerk of the District Court for the County of Adams by the payment to said Clerk of the District Court of the amounts awarded to such person, notice of distribution to such persons shall be given and made as may be provided by a rule or order of said Court. Payment made to the City Clerk or the Clerk of said court within 90 days shall be deemed compliance with the above requirement for payment within 90 days. If the Council disapproves the report or fails to provide for such payment within 90 days, such disapproval for failure shall be deemed a dismissal of the proceedings and a cancellation of the plat and an abandonment of the reservations of the street locations as shown on the plat, with the same liability of the City of Northglenn for expenses as provided in the case of abandonment by resolution; and thereupon the City Clerk shall cause to be transmitted to the County Clerk and Recorder of the County of Adams an attested statement of such abandonment.

(d)
Appeal from Awards. Within 20 days after the approval of any such report by the Council, any property owner dissatisfied with the award of compensation therein contained may file with the City Clerk notice of appeal to the District Court of the County of Adams. Within 10 days after receipt of such notice, the City Clerk shall file with the Clerk of the District Court of the County of Adams the report of the Board of Appraisers approved by the Council, together with certified copies of the resolution of the Council and the notice of appeal. Proceedings thereafter shall be conducted as provided by law.

(e)
No Compensation for Buildings. The reservation of a street location, as provided in Section 11-40-13 of this Ordinance, shall not be deemed to prohibit or impair in any respect the use of reserved land by the owner or occupant thereof for any lawful purpose, including the erection of any buildings thereon. No compensations, other than the compensation awarded in the final report of said Board of Appraisers as approved by the Council as provided in Section 11-40-13(d) of this Ordinance, in Section 11-40-13(d) of this Ordinance, shall at any time be paid by the City of Northglenn to, or recovered from the City of Northglenn by, any person for the taking of or injury to any building or structure built or erected within the period fixed in the resolution of Council upon such any reserved location. No compensation or damages for any such reservation shall be paid or recovered except as provided in Sections 11-40-13(b) to 11-40-13(d) of this Ordinance.

Section 11-42-6. Variances.

(a)
Where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of a specific piece of property at the time of the enactment of the Zoning Ordinance, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary and exceptional situation or condition of such piece of property, the strict application of the Zoning Ordinance would result in peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties to, or exceptional and undue hardships upon, the owner of such property, the Board may authorize, upon an appeal relating to the property, a variance from such strict application so as to relieve such difficulties or hardship as long as such relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without substantially impairing the intent and purpose of the Zoning Ordinance. No such variance shall be authorized by the Board unless it finds that:

(1)
The strict application of the Zoning Ordinance would produce undue hardship;

(2)
Such hardship is not shared generally by other properties in the same zoning district and the same vicinity;

(3)
The authorization of such variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property and the character of the district will not be changed by the granting of the variance; and

(4)
The granting of such variance is based upon reasons of demonstrable and exceptional hardship as distinguished from variations for purposes of convenience, profit, or caprice.

(b)
A variance may also be granted by the Board where strict application of the Zoning Ordinance would prevent achieving a public purpose. A public purpose may include, but shall not be limited to: protection of public safety; provision of public facilities including roadways, walkways, trails, water and sewer utilities, and storm drainage facilities; provision of public or private landscaping and open space; and accommodation of beneficial economic development projects. No such variance shall be authorized by the Board unless it finds that:

(1)
The strict application of the Zoning Ordinance would prevent achieving a clearly defined public purpose; and

(2)
The authorization of such variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property and the character of the district will not be changed by the granting of the variance.

REGULATIONS TO MINIMIZE FLOOD LOSSES
Section 11-52-1. Title. This Ordinance shall be known as the Northglenn Flood Hazard Ordinance.

[Source: Ord. 1477, 2007]

Section 11-52-2. Explanation of Public Concern. Based upon the several flood hazard studies undertaken within the current boundaries of the City of Northglenn, nationwide experience with flood waters, and field observations made in the City, the following conclusions are made.

(a)
Hazards Defined. The flood hazard areas of Northglenn are subject to periodic inundation which could result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.

(b)
Causes. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage property in other areas. Structures that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.

[Source: Ord. 1477, 2007]

Section 11-52-3. Purpose. The purpose of this Ordinance is to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, to minimize public and private flood losses in areas subject to flood hazards, and to promote wise use of flood hazard areas. To accomplish its purposes, this Ordinance includes provisions intended to:

(a)
Protect human life and health;

(b)
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;

(c)
Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and usually undertaken at public expense;

(d)
Minimize business interruptions;

(e)
Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities located in areas of special flood hazard;

(f)
Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the prudent use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas;

(g)
Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and

(h)
Ensure that those who occupy areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions.

(b)
Basis for Establishing Areas of Special Flood Hazard. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has identified the areas of special flood hazard in the Flood Insurance Study for Adams County, Colorado and Incorporated Areas, dated January 20, 2016, with accompanying flood insurance rate maps and/or flood boundary floodway maps (FIRM and/or FBFM), and this study and accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this Ordinance. For the purpose of final determination of the areas of special flood hazard, the flood profile shall control. The Flood Insurance Study and the Flood Insurance Rate Maps are on file in the Department of Public Works.

(c)
Establishment of Floodplain Development Permit. A development permit shall be required to ensure conformance with the provisions of this Article.

(d)
Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered, or have its use changed without full compliance with the terms of this Article and other applicable regulations.

(e)
Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This Article is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this Article and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.

(f)
Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this Ordinance, all provisions shall be:

(1)
Considered as minimum requirements;

(2)
Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and

(3)
Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.

(g)
Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this Article 52 is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based upon engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on occasions or the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This Ordinance does not imply that land outside areas of special flood hazard or land uses permitted within such areas will always be totally free from flooding or flood damages. Nor shall this Section create a liability on the part of, or create a cause of action against the City of Northglenn or any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this Ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

Section 11-52-13. Standards for Critical Facilities. A critical facility is a structure or related infrastructure, but not the land on which it is situated, as specified in Rule 6 of the Rules and Regulations for Regulatory Floodplains in Colorado, that if flooded may result in significant hazards to public health and safety or interrupt essential services and operations for the community at any time before, during and after a flood.

(a)
Classification of Critical Facilities. It is the responsibility of the City Council to identify and confirm that specific structures in their community meet the following criteria:

(b)
Critical facilities are classified under the following categories: (1) essential services; (2) hazardous materials; (3) at-risk populations; and (4) vital to restoring normal services.

(1)
Essential services facilities include public safety, emergency response, emergency medical, designated emergency shelters, communications, public utility plant facilities, and transportation lifelines.

These facilities consist of:

(A)
Public safety (police stations, fire and rescue stations, emergency vehicle and equipment storage, and, emergency operation centers);

(B)
Emergency medical (hospitals, ambulance service centers, urgent care centers having emergency treatment functions, and non-ambulatory surgical structures but excluding clinics, doctors offices, and non-urgent care medical structures that do not provide these functions);

(C)
Designated emergency shelters;

(D)
Communications (main hubs for telephone, broadcasting equipment for cable systems, satellite dish systems, cellular systems, television, radio, and other emergency warning systems, but excluding towers, poles, lines, cables, and conduits);

(E)
Public utility plant facilities for generation and distribution (hubs, treatment plants, substations and pumping stations for water, power and gas, but not including towers, poles, power lines, buried pipelines, transmission lines, distribution lines, and service lines); and

(F)
Air transportation lifelines (airports (municipal and larger), helicopter pads and structures serving emergency functions, and associated infrastructure, aviation control towers, air traffic control centers, and emergency equipment aircraft hangars).

(2)
Specific exemptions to this category include wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), non-potable water treatment and distribution systems, and hydroelectric power generating plants and related appurtenances.

(3)
Public utility plant facilities may be exempted if it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the City Council that the facility is an element of a redundant system for which service will not be interrupted during a flood. At a minimum, it shall be demonstrated that redundant facilities are available (either owned by the same utility or available through an intergovernmental agreement or other contract) and connected, the alternative facilities are either located outside of the 100-year floodplain or are compliant with the provisions of this Article, and an operations plan is in effect that states how redundant systems will provide service to the affected area in the event of a flood. Evidence of ongoing redundancy shall be provided to the City Council on an as-needed basis upon request.

(4)
Hazardous materials facilities include facilities that produce or store highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials. These facilities may include:

(A)
Chemical and pharmaceutical plants (chemical plant, pharmaceutical manufacturing);

(B)
Laboratories containing highly volatile, flammable, explosive, toxic and/or water-reactive materials;

(C)
Refineries;

(D)
Hazardous waste storage and disposal sites; and

(E)
Above ground gasoline or propane storage or sales centers.

(5)
Facilities shall be determined to be critical facilities if they produce or store materials in excess of threshold limits. If the owner of a facility is required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to keep a material safety data sheet (MSDS) on file for any chemicals stored or used in the work place, and the chemical(s) is stored in quantities equal to or greater than the threshold planning quantity (TPQ) for that chemical, then that facility shall be considered to be a critical facility. The TPQ for these chemicals is: either 500 pounds or the TPQ listed (whichever is lower) for the 356 chemicals listed under 40 CFR  302 (2010), also known as extremely hazardous substances (EHS); or 10,000 pounds for any other chemical. This threshold is consistent with the requirements for reportable chemicals established by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. OSHA requirements for MSDS can be found in 29 CFR  1910 (2010). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation "Designation, Reportable Quantities, and Notification," 40 CFR  302 (2010) and OSHA regulation "Occupational Safety and Health Standards," 29 CFR  1910 (2010) are incorporated herein by reference and include the regulations in existence at the time of the promulgation this Ordinance, but exclude later amendments to or editions of the regulations.

(6)
Specific exemptions to this category include:

(A)
Finished consumer products within retail centers and households containing hazardous materials intended for household use, and agricultural products intended for agricultural use.

(B)
Buildings and other structures containing hazardous materials for which it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the local authority having jurisdiction by hazard assessment and certification by a qualified professional (as determined by the local jurisdiction having land use authority) that a release of the subject hazardous material does not pose a major threat to the public.

(C)
Pharmaceutical sales, use, storage, and distribution centers that do not manufacture pharmaceutical products.

These exemptions shall not apply to buildings or other structures that also function as critical facilities under another category outlined in this article.

(7)
At-risk population facilities include medical care, congregate care, and schools. These facilities consist of:

(A)
Elder care (nursing homes); The lowest floor (including basement), electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities (including ductwork), must be elevated to one foot above the base flood elevation that existed prior to the placement of fill, or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that the structure or addition is watertight to at least one foot above the base flood level that existed prior to the placement of fill with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy.

(B)
Congregate care serving 12 or more individuals (day care and assisted living);

(C)
Public and private schools (pre-schools, K-12 schools, before-school and after-school care serving 12 or more children).

(8)
Facilities vital to restoring normal services including government operations. These facilities consist of:

(A)
Essential government operations (public records, courts, jails, building permitting and inspection services, community administration and management, maintenance and equipment centers);

(B)
Essential structures for public colleges and universities (dormitories, offices, and classrooms only).

These facilities may be exempted if it is demonstrated to the City Council that the facility is an element of a redundant system for which service will not be interrupted during a flood. At a minimum, it shall be demonstrated that redundant facilities are available (either owned by the same entity or available through an intergovernmental agreement or other contract), the alternative facilities are either located outside of the 100-year floodplain or are compliant with this Ordinance, and an operations plan is in effect that states how redundant facilities will provide service to the affected area in the event of a flood. Evidence of ongoing redundancy shall be provided to the City Council on an as-needed basis upon request.

(c)
Protection for Critical Facilities. All new and substantially improved critical facilities and new additions to critical facilities located within the special flood hazard area shall be regulated to a higher standard than structures not determined to be critical facilities. For the purposes of this Ordinance, protection shall include one of the following:

(1)
Location outside the special flood hazard area; or

(2)
Elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofing of the structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, to at least two feet above the base flood elevation.

(d)
Ingress and Egress for New Critical Facilities. New critical facilities shall, when practicable as determined by the City Council, have continuous non-inundated access (ingress and egress for evacuation and emergency services) during a 100-year flood event.

ARTICLE 56
OIL AND GAS REGULATION
Section 11-56-1. Purpose.

(a)
These regulations are enacted to provide for the safety, and preserve the health, safety and welfare of the present and future residents of the City. It is the City's intent by enacting these regulations to facilitate the development of oil and gas resources within the City while mitigating potential land use conflicts between such development and existing, as well as planned, land uses. It is recognized that under Colorado law the surface and mineral estates are separate and distinct interests in land and that one may be severed from the other. Owners of subsurface mineral interests, including oil and gas, have certain legal rights and privileges, including the right to use that part of the surface estate reasonably required to extract and develop their subsurface mineral interests subject to compliance with the provisions of these regulations and any applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. The State has a recognized interest in fostering the efficient development, production and utilization of oil and gas resources and in the prevention of waste and protection of the correlative rights of common owners and producers to a fair and equitable share of production profits. Similarly, owners of the surface estate have certain legal rights and privileges, including the right to have the mineral estate developed in a reasonable manner and to have adverse land use impacts upon their property, associated with the development of the mineral estate, mitigated through compliance with these regulations so long as these regulations do not create an operational conflict with the State's authority to regulate oil and gas development. Municipal governments have a recognized, traditional authority and responsibility to regulate land use within their jurisdiction to the extent they do not create an operational conflict. These regulations are intended as an exercise of this land use authority.

(b)
The City recognizes that this Article does not supersede or preempt the regulations of the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission ("COGCC") or any other state regulations, nor is this Article intended to conflict with them. The City acknowledges the authority of the COGCC and the application of its rules to oil and gas drilling and production operations within the City's boundaries. The City further acknowledges that a Permit to Drill issued by the COGCC shall be binding with respect to any operationally conflicting requirement under this Article.

[Source: Ord. 1585, 2011]

Section 11-56-2. General provisions.

(a)
The provisions of this Article shall apply to all oil and gas exploration and production operations proposed or existing on or beneath property within the City limits.

(b)
Legal nonconforming uses. Oil and gas facilities within City limits and operational prior to October 1, 2010, will be considered legal nonconforming uses.

(c)
Where provisions in this Article are in conflict with other provisions of this Code or other applicable regulations, the more restrictive, or that provision which results in the higher standard, shall apply unless the application of the Code results in an operational conflict with the State regulation of oil and gas development.

(d)
Exceptions to provisions of this Article which are of purely local concern may be granted by the City Council as part of the approval process of the permitted use permit only if the applicant demonstrates that the exception or waiver is necessary to prevent waste or protect correlative rights and can provide adequate mitigation measures for the standards waived.

(e)
A permitted use permit for oil and gas facilities shall become null and void three (3) years after approval of the permitted use permit if oil and gas development at the site for which the permit was issued does not commence.

Section 11-56-4. Permitted use permit required.

(a)
New oil and gas facilities.

(1)
It shall be unlawful for any person to drill a new well, construct a new facility or install new accessory equipment or structure within the corporate limits of the City unless a permitted use permit has been obtained pursuant to this Article. A separate permitted use permit shall be required for each well or production facility that has not been previously permitted under this Article except as outlined in Paragraph (a)(4) and Subsection (b) below.

(2)
If more than one (1) well or production facility is proposed at the same time, the applicant may submit one (1) application for multiple wells and facilities; however, a separate fee shall be required for each drill pad site included in the application. The City will issue a multiple oil and gas operations permit that notes the name and location of each well or production facility.

(3)
Any such permit issued pursuant to this Article shall encompass within its authorization the right for the operator, his or her agent, employee, subcontractor or independent contractor or any other persons to perform that work necessary in the drilling, completion or maintenance operations.

(4)
For the purpose of this Article, the installation of tanks, heaters, separators and other accessory equipment shall be construed as extensions to oil and gas wells and shall accordingly be subject to the same applications, review, permit, regulations and standards. The application for these accessories when intended to be installed at the same time as the oil or gas well may be merged with an application for an oil or gas well permitted use permit and shall not require an additional permit fee.

(b)
Modification to existing well sites.

(1)
When a well or well site is existing with an approved permitted use permit use, any twinning, deepening or recompleting of a well and relocation of accessory equipment or gathering lines and transmission lines does not require a new permit so long as all applicable regulations of this jurisdiction and the State are met, and the operator shall submit a revised site and operating plans to the City depicting any changes from the approved permitted use permit. This is an administrative approval and does not require any additional public hearings. Upon receipt of the amended site plan and operating plan, the City shall issue an existing use site plan order as provided in Section 11-56-7 of this Article.

(2)
If any changes are made to a legal nonconforming well or a well to which an existing use site plan order has been issued, i.e.: twinning, deepening or recompleting of a well, or relocation of accessory equipment or gathering lines and transmission lines occurs, the operator shall apply for a permitted use permit. By enactment of this Article, the City hereby approves any well, equipment or facility drilled or constructed prior to the enactment of this Article that occurred prior to annexation of additional acreage within the City.

(3)
When a permitted use permit has been granted for a well, reentry of such well for purposes of sidetracking, deepening, recompleting, reworking, activating or converting the well shall not require a separate permitted use permit.

(4)
The permitted use permit is limited to the facilities as shown in the approved plan. To the extent the applicant desires, after initial completion of a well, to place additional equipment on a tank battery or wellhead location which was not shown in the approved plan, the applicant must, except in a situation where additional temporary equipment is necessary for a period of fourteen (14) days or less, notify the City of installation of such additional equipment by letter and include a site plan showing the location of the new equipment. No new permitted use permit is required.

(c)
Terms and conditions of the permitted use permit.

(1)
The term of the permitted use permit shall be coterminous with the state well permit issued by the COGCC. Any extension of the permit granted by the COGCC shall result in an automatic extension of the term of the City-issued permitted use permit equal to the extension granted by the COGCC. A permit shall not be required for seismic surveys, unless the drilling of a seismic (shot hole), core or other exploratory hole is involved.

(2)
The permitted use permit shall automatically expire with the abandonment and reclamation of the associated well.

(3)
The granting of a permitted use permit shall not relieve the operator or owner of a well, production facility, pipeline or gathering line from otherwise complying with all applicable regulatory requirements of the City, the State or the United States.

(4)
Within thirty (30) days after the well is completed and equipped, the applicant shall provide to the City as-built drawings showing all facilities, pipelines, flow lines and gathering lines which the applicant has placed on the land subject to this permit. These as-built drawings shall be the same as submitted to the COGCC.

(5)
The permitted use permit and/or existing use site plan order required by this Article is in addition to any permit which may be required by any other provision of this Code or by any other governmental agency.

(6)
By acceptance of any permitted use permit and/or an existing use site plan order issued pursuant to this Article, the operator or owner of any well, production facility, pipeline or gathering line expressly stipulates and agrees to be bound by and comply with the provisions of this Article, and any subsequent amendments shall be deemed to be incorporated. The terms of this Article shall be deemed to be incorporated in any permitted use permit or existing use site plan issued pursuant to this Article with the same force and effect as if this Article was set forth verbatim in such permitted use permit or existing use site plan.

Section 12-2-4. Improvements Agreement Guarantee.

(a)
The subdivision being submitted for approval includes improvements necessary to serve the area being developed. It has been customary for the lot price in a subdivision to include payment for the improvements. Buyers have assumed that the governmental unit approving the subdivision has provided for the improvements at the time of plat approval. Such expectation has not coincided with the facts. As a consequence, many have purchased lots in new subdivisions expecting improvements to be constructed and paid for but the subdivider has suffered financial reverses. The burden of constructing the improvements then falls upon the buyers and the general public. The buyers should not have to pay twice for the improvements and since the improvements are almost wholly for the benefit of the area being developed, the general public should not have to absorb any of the costs incident to the construction of the improvements.

(b)
Based upon the above considerations, the City Council, for the protection of buyers in subdivided areas and the general public, is of the opinion that a form of guarantee must be furnished by the subdivider to assure the installation of the required public improvements in an approved manner and in a reasonable period of time. Prior to the presentation and acceptance of the final plat by the City Council, the subdivider shall execute an agreement with the City of Northglenn that guarantees shall be furnished for the construction of all public improvements.

(c)
Building permits will be issued for only that part of the plat for which the required financial guarantee or guarantees has or have been provided.

(d)
The agreement to furnish said guarantees shall be recorded to put purchasers and other interested parties on notice.

(e)
A release may be obtained for a lot or lots from the City through the Director of Community Works when the terms of the agreement have been satisfied for the lot or lots involved. A release executed and acknowledged by the Director of Community Works shall be binding upon the City of Northglenn as to the lot or lots covered by the terms of the release.

(f)
The agreement shall further provide that if at any time there is a breach of such agreement, the City of Northglenn may withhold approval of all building permits within the subdivision until such breach or breaches have been cured.

(g)
The minimum guarantee shall be for an area of one block. In the event there is a dispute as to the area to be covered by the guarantee, the Director of the Department of Community Works shall delineate the "block" of a given subdivision which will serve the needs of the potential residents. The guarantee shall provide that improvements shall be completed within twelve (12) months of the issuance of the first building permit or upon completion of 50 percent of the structures which can be erected in such block, whichever occurs first in time; however, if special circumstances exist the Director of the Department of Community Works may extend the time, or reduce it if, in his opinion, in accordance with the generally accepted engineering principles, any or all of the improvements are needed in less time for the residents of the area to protect the public health, safety and welfare, and such decision shall control.

(h)
The guarantee shall be for 100 percent of the estimated cost of the required public improvements as computed by the City Engineer. The public improvements referred to are water and sewer mains, roadbed and surface, gutter, sidewalks, bridges, culverts, other storm drainage improvements, and street identification and traffic control signs. Further, appropriate arrangements for telephone, gas, electricity and/or street lighting and appurtenances shall be made between the subdivider and the utility company involved. The guarantee shall be appropriately reduced or set over to apply to another block or blocks as the improvements are installed and paid for. When the guarantee is "rolled over" the subdivider shall make arrangements for an extension of time of the original guarantee. In the event the improvements are not installed as specified in the agreement and paid for by the subdivider, or in the event they are partially completed or fully completed and not completely paid for, the City will look to the guarantor to complete and/or pay for the specified improvements.

(i)
The guarantee may be in any of the following forms:

(1)
Escrow of funds with the City.

(2)
Escrow with a bank or savings and loan association with the unconditional right given to the City to draw on the funds deposited in the event the required improvements must be fully or partially constructed by the City or to pay for any bills which are outstanding for work done thereon by any party.

(3)
An irrevocable sight draft or letter of commitment in a form satisfactory to the City Attorney which guarantees the City that the financial backing is available so that the improvements will in fact be completed and paid for. The sight draft or letter of commitment may be from any financially responsible lender which is not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by the subdivider.

(j)
The form of the guarantee shall be such that the City is assured that the subdivider has funds committed to the amount and for the purposes herein stated and that in the event of a default by the subdivider, the City shall have available to it upon demand funds necessary to construct all or complete, the improvements and pay for the same.

Section 12-2-5. Parkland Dedication. In the event a parkland dedication is made and accepted by the City Council and any park so dedicated and accepted fronts upon a street in such subdivision, the City of Northglenn shall contribute from the said parkland dedication one-half of said abutting street and such will be indicated on the final plat. The subdivider shall be responsible for the cost of all of the improvements along the abutting parkland.

DESIGN STANDARDS
Section 12-3-1. Purpose. The character and environment of the City of Northglenn for future years will be greatly affected by the design of subdivisions and the plats that are approved by the City of Northglenn. Planning, layout and design of a subdivision are of the utmost concern. The residents must have available to them within the area safe and convenient movement to points of destination or collection. Modes of travel to achieve this objective should not conflict with each other or abutting land uses. Lots and blocks should provide desirable settings for the buildings that are to be constructed, make use of natural contours and protect the view, afford privacy for the residents and protection from adverse noise and vehicular traffic. Natural features and vegetation of the area must be preserved if at all possible. Schools, parks, churches and other community facilities should be planned for as an integral part of the area.

[Source: Ord. 177, 1972]

Section 12-3-2. Site Considerations.

(a)
Steep land (10 per cent slope or greater of the majority of the lots), unstable land, and areas having inadequate drainage, are problems of such a nature as to be hazardous to health, life or property, and areas with such problems shall not be platted unless acceptable provisions are made to eliminate or control the problems under the supervision of and with the certified written approval of a registered professional engineer qualified in the particular field. Such plans must be approved by the City Engineer, who shall judge the same by generally accepted principles of engineering adapted to the particular circumstances. Such problem areas may be included as part of a lot or lots where there is a buildable portion free of such problems.

(b)
All development in the subdivision shall be carried out in conformity with the plans as finally approved.

(c)
Drainage areas wherever possible should be left in a natural state and no encroachments shall be made on the natural channel area. Any land subject to flooding by a 100 year flood shall not be platted for residential occupancy or other permanent development unless adequate provisions are made to provide for, to eliminate or control flood hazards as they apply to the area being developed and the general vicinity. A registered engineer shall propose the controls, with approval thereof by the Director of Public Works, who shall apply generally accepted engineering standards in the area of drainage and flood control to the solution proposed by the subdivider's engineer.

(d)
A drainage plan for the proposed subdivision and every part thereof, certified by a registered professional engineer, is required in every case, whether or not any problem areas or flood plains exist or appear to exist. The drainage plan shall be approved by the Director of Public Works, who shall apply generally accepted engineering standards in the area of drainage and flood control to the plan proposed by the subdivider's engineer. Approval of the drainage plan for any proposed subdivision may be conditioned upon compliance with the provisions of Section 12-3-2(e).

(e)
No building permit shall issue for the construction of any building to be used for residential occupancy except upon the express requirement that the building pad must be not less than one foot six inches above the elevation of the back of the curb, unless the Director of Community Development and the Director of Public Works concur for good and sufficient reason in approving an exception to the requirement. Such exception shall be granted only upon a determination that the drainage requirements of the lot can be met by other means.

(f)
Where a subdivision borders a railroad right-of-way, a freeway, or an arterial or collector street, the design thereof shall include adequate provisions for reduction of noise. A parallel street, a landscaped buffer area, or lots with increased setbacks, are recommended solutions among others.

A "T", "Y", or other design to provide a turn-around may be used in such cases if the same is approved by the Director of Community Works. Surface drainage of such cul-de-sacs shall be toward the intersecting street, or, if this is not feasible, a drainage easement shall be provided through abutting lots. Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed 400 feet in length and the end shall be visible from the connecting street.

(f)

(h)
Access to a freeway, arterial or collector street shall occur only at intersections approved by the Director of Community Works. The Director of Community Works shall consult with the Traffic Engineer who shall determine the intersection or intersections for access based upon standards for efficient traffic movement and safety for drivers and pedestrians.

(i)
The dedication of a half street shall not be accepted unless:

(1)
The subdivider obtains for the City a dedication from the abutting landowner of the other one-half of the street; and

(2)
The subdivider obtains from the said abutting landowner an agreement in a form satisfactory to the City Attorney which guarantees the cost of the improvements and construction of the same on the half street within a time suitable to the Director of Community Works; and

(3)

(4)
Any other similar arrangement recommended by the Director of Community Works and approved by the Planning Commission and City Council.

(j)
When the plat dedicates a street which ends on the plat or is on the perimeter of the plat, the subdivider shall convey the last foot of the street on the terminal end or outside border of the plat to the City of Northglenn in fee simple and such shall be designated by using Outlot(s); the City shall put the same to public use for public road and access purposes when, within its sole and absolute discretion, it deems advisable.

(k)
Reverse curves on arterials and collectors shall be joined by a tangent at least 100 feet in length.

(l)
Street, and easement right-of-way widths and grades shall meet the following standards:

Section 12-3-6. Public Sites, Reservations and Dedications.

(a)
Dedications of rights-of-way for public streets through the classification of collector, utility easements, drainage and maintenance easements, and other interests required under the provisions of this chapter shall be made by the subdivider on the plat unless otherwise directed by the City Council.

(b)

(1)
Reservation of sites for schools, streets above the classification of collector, greenbelt and other land which is needed for public use upon recommendation from the public agency therein involved shall be delineated on the final plat and reserved for public purchase. The said reservation shall be an irrevocable option for one year, with a right in the public agency to extend it on an annual basis for two additional years. Each extension shall be granted by the subdivider after receiving notice of such election from the public agency involved at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date of expiration. If the option is not so extended, the area so reserved will be free and clear of any and all claim of the said public agency. During the period of the reservation the subdivider shall not erect any structure or improvement thereon but can use the area for purposes other than development; however, such use shall not be inconsistent with the purposes for which the area is being reserved and the use(s) must be approved by the public agency or agencies involved. The public agency benefiting from the reservation shall inform the Adams County Assessor of the property involved, that it has been reserved for the public benefit and shall request that it be assessed on the tax rolls at the minimum value.

(2)
The public agency or agencies benefiting from the reservation, if the subdivider makes no use of the reserved area during the period of the reservation, shall pay the amount of the taxes assessed against the reserved area to the subdivider on an annual basis. Further, it shall pay to the subdivider at the time of renewal of each one year's irrevocable option interest at the rate of five (5) percent per annum on the "agreed price". Interest at the said rate will be due also from the date of last option payment to the date the property is conveyed. The "agreed price" shall be based upon the unimproved, undeveloped, current land value of the reserved area and shall be agreed upon, if possible, by the subdivider and the public agency benefiting from the reservation prior to final plat approval.

(3)
If the parties are unable to agree upon a price, they may negotiate and select one appraiser mutually satisfactory or negotiate on any other basis suitable to both parties to determine "agreed price". If the parties are unable to make satisfactory arrangements, court proceedings shall determine "agreed price" and the date of the reservation will be the date to be used in the determination of "agreed price".

(4)
The court action to determine "agreed price" shall be instituted within ninety days after the plat has been approved even though the actual purchase is not made until later. Taxes as above set forth along with interest at five (5) percent per annum on the "agreed price" during the period of the reservation shall be paid to the subdivider by the public agency. Any encumbrance against the reserved area will be released at the time the "agreed price" is paid.

(5)
If the subdivider refuses to reserve a designated area, such shall be grounds for denying approval of the plat. However, if the subdivider is unable to agree with the public agency upon a price for the reserved area, such shall not be grounds for denying approval of the plat.

(c)

(1)
The area which was eventually incorporated as the City of Northglenn was developed as a planned community. The subdividers of this area dedicated to the public suitable and adequate lands for schools, parks, and other public uses needed to serve the people which their subdividing activity generated. It is the philosophy of the Planning Commission and City Council that the dedication of land by subdividers for schools, parks, and other public uses is a fair and equitable practice for all parties concerned. It is therefore the intent of the City Council to continue this practice by requiring the subdividers of all land divisions affected by this ordinance to dedicate ten (10) percent of the gross acreage of their development or money in lieu thereof for schools, parks, or other public uses. This land dedication is in addition to lands dedicated for public rights-of-way or easement purposes.

(2)
The Planning Commission shall make recommendations to City Council concerning land dedications or money in lieu thereof. The Commission's recommendations shall be based upon the adopted master plan and comments and suggestions received from the various reviewing agencies and City staff. The following factors shall be considered in determining whether land or money in lieu thereof shall be dedicated: the size of the development and its adequacy for accommodating a suitable park and/or school site; the need for park, school, or other public use sites in the immediate area; and the topography, geology and location of land in the subdivision available for dedication and the needs of the people in the area. In lieu of dedicating such area within the proposed subdivisions, the subdivider may dedicate an alternate parcel of the required size within 3/4 of a mile of the proposed subdivision which is acceptable to the City Council after a review and recommendation by the Planning Commission based upon the standards and considerations as above set forth. If a site is accepted, such shall be free of all liens and encumbrances and shall be dedicated to the City of Northglenn for park, school, and other public use purposes.

(d)

(1)
In the event a land dedication as above set forth is not approved, then money in lieu of land dedication shall be required. The cash contribution shall equal ten (10) percent of the fair market value of the land to be divided based upon the zoning required for the contemplated development. The cash contribution shall be made prior to approval of the final plat. The funds shall be separately accounted for and shall be used to acquire or develop if possible under the circumstances, parks, schools, or other public use sites within 3/4 of a mile of the area being developed. Land so acquired shall be in the name of the City of Northglenn and/or the school district.

(2)
The City and the subdivider may agree upon the fair market value of the land or they may negotiate and select one appraiser mutually satisfactory or negotiate on any other basis suitable to both parties to determine the fair market value of the land. If the parties are unable to make satisfactory arrangements, court proceedings shall be instituted to resolve the question of the fair market value of the land, provided, however, that the subdivider shall be required to abide by the court's decision. The plat shall be approved once the court proceedings have been instituted to determine the fair market value of the land.

(e)
If the land being subdivided is in the process of annexation, the subdivider shall meet City of Northglenn standards according to policies and guidelines on annexation as adopted by resolution, motion or ordinance by the City Council.

(f)
In the event the land being subdivided has been annexed and as a part of the annexation proceedings has been subject as a part thereof to a parkland contribution, or a cash payment in lieu thereof, or a dedication for school and/or other public use purposes, then the requirement as herein set forth for land or cash in lieu of land should be waived.

(l)
"Mixed Usage" as used to determine water utility charges, shall mean that water quantity which is used in a manner that includes both "return-flow" and "non-return-flow" usage.

(m)

(p)
"Residential Unit" shall mean any discrete dwelling unit approved by appropriate Municipal Code or State Statutes and used principally for human "living quarters." A "residential unit" is not determined by the number or relationship of its occupants, but rather by the principal activity within, that is, domestic habitation on a permanent (non-transient) basis. For these purposes, "residential unit" includes, but is not limited to, each detached home, each individual apartment unit, each individual residential condominium, each individual townhome, and specifically excludes hotels and motels.

(w)
"Water Utility Charges" shall mean the combined total of the City's various fees for providing water utility services, and includes but is not limited to, the "utility capital charge" (Section 16-10-3) and the "utility usage charges" (Sections 16-10-4 and 16-10-5).

(x)
"Winter Average" as used to determine sewer charges for mixed use taps, shall mean the average monthly quantity of water used, as reflected by billings, for the most recent months of December, January, February and March. Because actual "return-flow-usage" cannot be determined without metering "return-flow-water," based upon the presumption that "irrigation" usage is negligible during winter months, this method shall serve as an alternate determination of a given account's "return-flow-usage" as well as the City's average "return-flow-usage." The City Manager, may modify or waive the application of the method for determining winter average in any year in which the application of such method would result in an increase in sewer charges due, in the opinion of the City Manager, substantially to a combination of below average precipitation and protection of valuable landscaping, when such usage would result in an extraordinary increase as determined by the City.

[Source: Ord. 1101, 1994; 1268, 2000]

Section 16-10-3. Utility Capital Charge. "Annual utility capital cost" shall be apportioned to individual accounts in the form of a monthly "utility capital charge." The amount billed to individual accounts shall be the rate as calculated in Section 16-10-3(a) and, if applicable, discounted by an amount calculated in Section 16-10-3(b) and then multiplied by the "EQR" value assigned per Section 16-10-3(d). A "utility capital charge" will be assessed monthly to each account upon the installation of the water meter for the premises served, whether or not any other "utility usage charges" are applicable to the individual account during the month.

(a)
Calculation of Base "Utility Capital Charge" Rate. In general terms, subject to reasonable contingency and adjustments to avoid large year-to-year fluctuations, the base monthly capital charge per "EQR" shall be calculated according to the following formula:

(A - B) / 12 / C = base monthly "utility capital charge" per "EQR"

in which the following terms apply:

"A" is the "annual utility capital cost."

"B" is the amount of money projected to be received during the year from sources other than "utility capital charges" and planned to be used for payment of "annual utility capital cost" where the discount to capital charge is not earmarked for a specific category of customer. (Examples could include tap fee revenue or revenue from sales of property earmarked for this purpose.)

"C" is the total number of "equivalent residential units."

(b)
Calculation of discount to be applied to the base "Utility Capital Charge" rate for certain categories of customer. Where categories of revenue are allocated by resolution or ordinance to apply to specific categories of customers (i.e. sales tax on food applied to reduce residential capital charge rates or property tax revenue applied to reduce the capital charge rates of those customers paying ad valorem property taxes) the discount to the monthly capital charge per "EQR" for that category of customer shall be calculated according to the following formula:

D / 12 / E = Monthly discount to applicable categories of customers

in which the following terms apply:

"D" is the amount of money projected to be received during the year from sources where such revenue is earmarked by resolution or ordinance for a specific category of customer.

"E" is the total number of "equivalent residential units" in the customer category being discounted.

(c)
"Utility capital charge" rates shall be reviewed by the City Council no less frequently than annually to ensure that they comply with the requirements of this section. In no case will "utility capital charge" rates be set such that the projected ending budgetary balance in funds restricted for Water and Wastewater Fund debt payments exceeds the scheduled amount required for subsequent year May 1st Water and Wastewater General Obligation Bond payments.

(d)
Calculation of "Equivalent Residential Unit" volume of water. The "equivalent residential unit" volume of water used in this section to apportion the "utility capital charges" shall be determined by the following formula:

F / G = usage equivalent to 1 EQR

in which the following terms apply.

"F" is the city-wide five year rolling average volume of water delivered to detached single-family residential unit accounts as determined by the City's billing records.

"G" is the five year rolling average number of detached single-family residential unit accounts as of December 31st of the previous year.

(e)
Determination of "EQR" Assessment. An individual account's "EQR" assessment shall be determined from the following table or formulae:

Account Meter Classification	"EQR" Assessment
1) Each individually-metered detached-single-family residential unit	1
2) Each attached but individually-metered residential unit (having no shared meters)	1
3) Attached residential units that are individually-metered and that also have one or more shared meters as part of the residential complex:	
2, 3, or 4 units within the complex	0.65/unit
5 or more units within the complex	0.50/unit
4) Attached residential units not individually-metered shall have the "EQR" assessment, in total, for all of the shared meters serving the complex combined as follows:	
2, 3, or 4 units within the complex	0.90/unit
5, 6, or 7 units within the complex	0.70/unit
8 or more units within the complex	0.55/unit
5) Residential units contained within a complex also containing separate non-residential meters (a "mixed-use" building in terms of zoning ordinances) shall have the residential units "EQR" assessment determined by the most applicable of the preceding classification numbers 2, 3, or 4 of this table. If the residential units are not separately metered from the non-residential portion of the mixed-use complex, then the "EQR's" divided by "R" equal less than 0.50:

L / H = #EQR's, EXCEPT #EQR's / R = 0.50

in which the following terms apply:

"L" is the five year rolling average volume of water for all the "mixed use" complex's meters combined, including "Non-Return-Flow" usage.

"H" is the "EQR" volume of water as determined in Section 16-10-3(b).

"R" is the number of "residential units" contained within the entire complex.

6) Extended Care Facilities (as defined in Section 16-10-2 (a)) shall have "EQR's" assigned according to the criteria in the preceding Section 4 according to the number of "Residential Units" contained within the facility, determined by the formula:

M / N = #EQR's

in which the following terms apply:

"M" is the maximum number of patients, residents, or occupants permitted by the certificate of occupancy or under applicable building or fire codes.

"N" is the average number of occupants per "Residential Unit" within the City, as determined by the most recent census.

7) "Non-Residential" accounts of all types shall have the account's "EQR" assessment determined individually, on an annual basis, according to the following formula, except that in no event shall the number of "EQR's" equal less than 0.50:

V / H = #EQR's, EXCEPT #EQR's = 0.50

in which the following terms apply:

"V" is the individual account's "five year rolling average" volume of water.

"H" is the "EQR" volume of water determined by the formula in Section 16-10-3 (b).

8) "EQR's" for accounts connected to the system for either water services only or sewer services only shall be assessed at one half the otherwise applicable rate.

9) New accounts and/or accounts with insufficient historical data to establish a "five year rolling average," as may be required for determination of an "EQR" assessment, shall be assessed an estimated volume determined by the Director of Natural Resources. For this purpose, the Director may use comparable data from similar accounts, if such similar accounts exist, or may use data supplied by the customer to estimate the approximate volume of water expected to be used by that account during the next 12 month period. Once a 12 month billing history is available, that account's "EQR" assessment shall be determined by using the first year's actual volume as the basis for calculation. Should the "EQR" established by the 12 month billing history be less than the estimated "EQR" assessment, the City shall refund to the customer the difference between the capital charges actually paid during said 12 month period and the amount that would have been paid based on the final "EQR" assessment. Conversely, should the "EQR" established by the 12 month billing history be more than the estimated "EQR" assessment, the City shall bill to and collect from the customer the difference between the capital charges actually paid during said 12 month period and the amount that would have been paid based on the final "EQR" assessment. Each subsequent year's actual volume will then be included in the average volume used, until such time as a "five year rolling average" is available for that account. A new business which begins using a tap previously used is considered a new account.

Section 16-10-4. Utility Usage Charges--Fresh Water. Monthly charges for use of fresh water supplied by the City to all utility accounts shall be made in a manner that is directly dependent upon the actual or estimated quantity of water used by that account during that billing period, and at incremental rates that are dependent upon the City's cost of obtaining and providing that quantity of water. The determination of applicable rates shall be no less frequently than annually, in accordance with the following subsections:

(a)
The costs of both Water and Wastewater operations are accounted for in a single fund. Based upon the annual budget and a multiple year forecast of required expenses, necessary reserves, and contingency, both water and sewer usage rates shall be set at levels approximating those necessary to recover "operating, maintenance, direct, general, and accounting costs" attributable to the separate systems. To smooth rates and avoid large year-to-year fluctuations, the need to recover projected combined water/wastewater operational expenses may also impact the rate setting equation.

(b)
The City Council shall only increase fresh water usage rates by ordinance. Prior to the public hearing pursuant to Section 4.10(b) of the City of Northglenn Home Rule Charter, details regarding the proposed rate increase(s) shall be posted in full, including the day, hour, and place at which Council shall hold the Public Hearing regarding the proposed rate increase.

(d)
Due to the Requirement that water used under the FRICO exchange be supplemented by 10% upon return to the FRICO system, cost differences exist between water provided for uses having a "return flow" and for uses that preclude "return-flow" (usually "irrigation" water). Fresh water usage rates shall consider this cost differential and be set such that the rate for estimated usage of "irrigation" water is greater than the rate for "non-irrigation" water.

Section 16-10-5. Utility Usage Charges--Wastewater. Monthly charges for wastewater collection, treatment and storage services provided by the City to all utility accounts within the City's boundaries shall be in a manner that is generally dependent upon the quantity of water that is returned directly to the wastewater system (i.e., the accounts "return flow"). New accounts and/or accounts with insufficient historical data to establish a "winter average," as may be required for determination of an "EQR" assessment, shall be assessed an estimated volume determined by the director of water and environmental services. For this purpose, the director may use comparable data from similar accounts, if such similar accounts exist, or may use data supplied by the customer. Once a 12 month billing history is available, that account's "EQR" assessment shall be determined by using the first year's actual volume as the basis for calculation. Should the "EQR" 12 month history be less than the estimated "EQR" assessment, the city shall refund to the customer the difference between the rates actually paid for wastewater service during said 12 month period and the amount that would have been paid based on the final "EQR" assessment. Should the "EQR" 12 month history be more than the estimated "EQR" assessment volume, the customer shall be subsequently assessed for any such additional charges.

(a)
For "mixed usage" accounts, in lieu of separate and specific "return flow" measurement by meters, "return flow" is normally assumed to be the "winter average" fresh-water volume supplied to an account during the winter months when "irrigation usage" is generally not required. If another method (metering or other adequate documentation of water used for "return-flow" vs. "non-return flow" purposes) is available, the most accurate method shall be used for volumetric determination. The City Council may promulgate other methods for determining "return flow" where the property receiving sewer service was unoccupied during all or any portion of the period used to determine "winter average." Such other method shall be just, reasonable, non-discriminatory and cost of service based.

(b)
For accounts utilizing supplied fresh-water for purposes that result primarily in "return-flow" (accounts with only minimal "irrigation" usage) the utility charge for wastewater collection may be based upon the average monthly quantity of water used, as reflected by billings, for the most recent months of April through March.

(c)
For accounts utilizing supplied fresh-water only for purposes that do not utilize "return-flow" (usually "irrigation only" accounts) no "utility usage charges" for wastewater services shall be assessed. Additionally, accounts that utilize their own, approved wastewater disposal system which physically precludes any means of conveyance of wastewater into the City's wastewater collection system (so that there cannot be return flow through any conduit including storm drainage systems) shall not be assessed "utility usage charges" for wastewater services. This provision in no way rescinds nor affects the "utility capital charge" applicable to each account as specified in Section 16-10-3.

(d)
The costs of both Wastewater and Water operations are accounted for in a single fund. Based upon the annual budget and a multiple year forecast of required expenses, necessary reserves and contingency, both sewer and water usage rates shall be set at levels approximating those necessary to recover "operating, maintenance, direct, general, and accounting costs" attributable to the separate systems. To smooth rates and avoid large year-to-year fluctuations, the need to recover projected combined water/wastewater operational expenses may also impact the rate setting equation. Charges to individual accounts will be calculated by multiplying the average winter consumption, or alternative method of determining "return-flow" volume, times the "metered coefficient" times the incremental rate.

(e)
The City Council shall only increase wastewater usage rates by ordinance. Prior to the public hearing pursuant to Section 4.10(b) of the City of Northglenn Home Rule Charter, details regarding the proposed rate increase(s) shall be posted in full, including the day, hour and place at which Council shall hold the Public Hearing regarding the proposed rate increase.

(See Notes #1 and #2)

Note #1. For all "non-residential" wastewater having a 5 day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) greater than 200 parts per million (ppm), the "metered coefficient" may be proportionally raised, with coefficients assigned to recover the incremental cost of treatment of the higher concentration of BOD5.

Note #2. For all "non-residential" wastewater having a total suspended solids concentration (TSS) greater than 190 parts per million (ppm), the "metered coefficient" may be proportionally raised, with coefficients assigned to recover the incremental cost of treatment of the higher concentration of TSS.

(g)
Additional costs in wastewater treatment or conveyance that are imposed upon the wastewater system by a particular user or class of users may be a determinant in the rate(s) charged to that account or class of accounts. For such accounts, the "metered coefficient" will be adjusted to reflect associated increased costs.

Section 16-10-6. Bills for Utility Services, Delinquent Payments, Disconnection.

(a)
Charges for utility services shall be billed to each account monthly.

(b)
Bills for utility services shall itemize, by category, all current charges.

(c)
A bill for utility service shall become delinquent two days before the next month's billing for the affected account.

(d)
Interest charges shall be applied to all delinquent balances (including principal and accrued interest). The interest rate shall be established bi-annually by The Director of Finance and shall not be less than the Wall Street Journal average month-end prime rate for the previous six months.

(e)
If the account is delinquent on two (2) monthly bills and the customer has failed to establish payment terms pursuant to Subsection (g), utility service is subject to disconnection.

(1)
Prior to disconnection of individually metered residential units, the City shall:

Provide written notice at least ten (10) days prior to disconnection of service. Such notice shall be both mailed to the customer and posted on the premises for which the charge reflected on the bill is due. The ten (10) day period shall commence after posting. A Notice of Disconnection charge shall be added to the account in accordance with the fee schedule approved by the Board.

Include a provision in the written notice advising the customer, whose account is delinquent, of his right to an administrative hearing before the Finance Director during the ten (10) day period, the only issue at such hearing being whether a delinquency exists and the accuracy of the delinquent bills.

(2)
Prior to disconnection of non-individually-metered residential units and non-residential units, the City shall:

Provide written notice at least seventeen (17) days prior to disconnection of service. Such notice shall be both mailed to the customer by registered or certified mail and posted on the premises for which the charge reflected on the bill is due. The seventeen (17) day period shall commence after posting. A Notice of Disconnection charge shall be added to the account in accordance with the fee schedule approved by the Board.

Include a provision in the written notice advising the customer, whose account is delinquent, of his right to an administrative hearing before the Finance Director during the seventeen (17) day period, the only issue at such hearing being whether a delinquency exists and the accuracy of the delinquent bills.

(f)
Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection (e) hereof, utility service for any residential or non-residential unit is subject to immediate disconnection whenever the customer files a petition for protection under the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, as amended, and neither the trustee in bankruptcy nor the customer, within twenty (20) days after the date of the order for relief, furnishes adequate assurance of payment, in the form of a deposit or other security, for service after such date, as provided by 11 U.S.C. Section 366, as amended. Upon receipt of the order for relief, the City shall give the trustee in bankruptcy and customer twenty (20) days written notice before actually disconnecting utility service. The written notice shall contain a provision advising the trustee in bankruptcy and the customer of the amount of the deposit or other security that must be provided to the City before the expiration of the twenty (20) day notice period. Provided, however, that utility service to a non-individually-metered residential unit or non-residential unit shall not be disconnected until such action is approved by the City Council.

(g)
The Finance Director, or his designee is authorized to establish payment terms with any customer, whose account is delinquent. If the payment terms are not complied with, the account may be subject to disconnection without further notice. The Finance Director, or his designee, may also write-off amounts up to $100.00 which, in his opinion, are not economically collectable.

(h)
Utility services disconnected pursuant to this section shall not be reconnected until the customer pays the delinquent bill or establishes payment terms accepted by the Finance Director. A service reconnection charge shall be added to the account for costs related to service reconnection.

(i)
The City shall have as security for collection of all utilities charges, a lien upon the real property served. The lien shall become effective upon supplying of water utility services and or billing of capital charge, trash collection/removal, and other associated rates, penalties and charges. The lien shall not be discharged until payment of all utilities charges. In order to preserve any lien created by operation of this ordinance, the City shall file for record a lien statement in the office of the Adams County Clerk and Recorder, at any time before the expiration of five months after the day in which a bill for utilities charges becomes delinquent as defined by this Article. All liens created and perfected by virtue of this ordinance shall relate back to and take effect as of the time that utilities services are first provided to or billed for, respectively, the real property. Such lien shall be enforceable against any person acquiring an interest in such real property. Liens which are created by this ordinance, but not perfected, shall be enforceable against any person, with an interest in the real property subject to the lien, that has notice of such lien. In the event the lien provided by this section is not discharged by payment, the City Manager shall report the delinquency to the City Council and the City Council shall be authorized to collect the delinquent charges, rates and penalties by certification of such delinquency with the Adams County Treasurer and collected as all other taxes as authorized by C.R.S. 31-20-1-1 to 107, as amended.

(j)
Any customer that does not occupy the property to which utility services are provided, which property is occupied by persons other than the customer, may request to have water utility usage services disconnected or terminated from the property by signing and depositing a "Request for Termination of Utility Services and Release" with the Finance Director. In the event that a customer, who has requested disconnection or termination of water utility usage services under this section, later requests that those services be reconnected, or applies for connection of utility services pursuant to Section 16-14-3, such utility services shall not be reconnected until the customer has paid a reconnect charge of three hundred dollars ($300.00). This section shall not apply to a customer that requests the temporary disconnection of utility services from his property for the purpose of repairing the water and sewer system maintained on the property.

(k)
The Director of Finance shall have the authority to establish a service fee schedule, which will be applied to customer accounts for services provided by the City of Northglenn. The fee schedule will be reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect the general practices of surrounding water and wastewater utilities and actual costs associated with the delivery of the services.

Section 16-11-8. Consent to Ground Water Appropriation.

(a)
The Clerk of the Water Court, Water Division No. 1, State of Colorado, caused the publication of Notice to all property owners in the City of Northglenn in the Northglenn/Thornton Sentinel on June 12, 1980, and July 10, 1980, that the Water Court, Water Division No. 1, State of Colorado, Case no. W-8445-76, had been requested by the City of Northglenn, pursuant to Section 37-92-304(3), C.R.S., to grant the City of Northglenn the right to withdraw water from the Arapahoe and Laramie-Fox Hills aquifers underlying the City of Northglenn. Those persons who did not have existing wells or who did not file a notice of lack of consent to the City of Northglenn's withdrawal of water under their land in the Office of the Clerk of the Water Court, Water Division No. 1, State of Colorado, on or before July 30, 1980, are deemed to have waived any right to such water, and impliedly consented to the withdrawal of such water by the City of Northglenn. The Water Court, Water Division No. 1, State of Colorado, in computing the amount of water decreed in Case No. W-8445-76, included all lands located within the City limits of the City of Northglenn, except those areas covered by existing wells and covered by any notices of lack of consent filed with the Clerk of the Water Court on or before July 30th, 1980. Notwithstanding the fact that the above-mentioned consent was the subject of a water court application for determination of non-tributary groundwater rights filed by the City of Northglenn prior to January 1, 1985, the inhabitants of the City of Northglenn consented to the withdrawal of such water by the City by virtue of this Ordinance, which became effective on August 21, 1980. The consent obtained by the City of Northglenn which was the subject of Case No. W-8445-76, in and for Water Division No. 1, State of Colorado, and the consent that exists by virtue of this ordinance, which consent existed prior to January 1, 1985, satisfies the consent requirements of Section 37-90-37(b)(II)(B), C.R.S.

(b)
In satisfaction of Section 37-90-137(b)(II)(C), C.R.S. the owners of all land which overlies such groundwater hereby appropriated which were not deemed to have consented to the withdrawal by the City of Northglenn of all such groundwater by (a) above shall be deemed to have consented to the withdrawal effective date hereof, unless no such consent shall be deemed to have been given as otherwise provided by law as set forth in Section 37-90-137(8), C.R.S.

CITY URBAN RUNOFF DRAINAGE ORDINANCE
Section 16-13-1. Title. This ordinance shall be known and cited as the "City Urban Runoff Drainage Ordinance."

[Source: Ord. 531, 1979]

Section 16-13-2. Purpose. The City Council recognizes that the City is subject to damage from floods. The presently existing storm drainage facilities provide some protection, but are inadequate for containing storms other than those of a minor nature. As development of the land area within the City continues, the runoff of storm water increases, thereby increasing the volume of water which the City's storm drainage facilities must contain.

Each property owner within the City, to the extent that he makes use of the City's storm drainage facilities by means of adding storm water runoff to those facilities beyond the amount of runoff which would occur if the land were undeveloped, should pay for the use, and his share of the cost, of such facilities.

In addition to these general purposes, the City Council declares that this ordinance is adopted for the following specific purposes:

(a)
To promote the public health, safety, and welfare, by permitting the movement of emergency vehicles during flooding periods, and to minimize flood losses and the inconvenience and damage resulting from uncontrolled and unplanned storm runoff in the City;

(b)
To implement a plan that includes a coordinated program of creating upstream ponding for temporary detention of storm runoff waters;

(c)
To establish a storm drainage and flood control manager in the Public Works Department in order to coordinate, design, construct, manage, operate and maintain the storm drainage and flood control system;

(d)
To establish reasonable storm drainage and flood control fees on the basis of the use made of storm drainage facilities; and

(e)
To encourage and facilitate urban water resources management techniques, including detention of storm runoff, minimization of the need to construct storm sewers, reduction of pollution, and the enhancement of the environment.

[Source: Ord. 531, 1979; 1608, 2011]

Section 16-13-3. Definitions. For the purposes of this chapter, the following words and terms shall be defined as follows, unless the context in which they are used clearly indicates otherwise:

(a)
"Facilities" includes all uses of land which are made in conjunction with, and which are related and incident to, the construction, installation and use of the physical structures and equipment necessary to contain and control storm water, such as channels, bridges, pipes, etc.;

(b)
"Historic one hundred year flood plain" means that area along a channel that would be inundated by a one hundred year flood if no development had occurred.

[Source: Ord. 531, 1979]

Section 16-13-4. Implementation of Urban Runoff Management Plan.

(a)
The City Manager shall implement the existing Urban Runoff Management Plan.

(b)
The Urban Runoff Management Plan, based on engineering studies, indicates the location of all drainage facilities in the City, including those facilities which presently exist and those which are determined to be needed, and which are intended to be constructed, in the future. The facilities shown on the plan include all major drainage ways which directly or indirectly affect drainage within the City, all drainage basins within the City, and all conduits, channels, natural drainage course, retention reservoirs, easements, culverts, bridges and other facilities which are required to provide for the drainage and control of surface waters within the basins of the drainage ways and to carry such waters to designated points of outflow or discharge. Maximum citizen participation during all phases of the implementation of the storm drainage and flood control regulations shall be encouraged.

To insure citizen participation on actual construction projects, at any time a project is proposed by the City to implement the Urban Runoff Management Plan, the City administration shall hold a public hearing in the neighborhood where the project is to be constructed. The Planning Board and City Council shall hold public hearings prior to construction of the project.

[Source: Ord. 531, 1979]

Section 16-13-5. Supplementary Studies. Supplementary studies shall be made by the City Manager to determine the estimated cost of constructing the drainage facilities shown on the Urban Runoff Management Plan and which do not presently exist. This estimated cost shall include the expense of any necessary land acquisition, as well as the cost of the supplementary studies themselves.

[Source: Ord. 531, 1979]

Section 16-13-6. Purpose of Urban Runoff Management Plan. The purpose of the Urban Runoff Management Plan is to identify and alleviate present and future drainage and flooding problems in the City by means of presenting in an orderly fashion the general data and information which are essential in understanding the relationship between rainfall and storm runoff. The Urban Runoff Management Plan shall serve as the official designation of drainage facilities and drainage ways shown thereon. The Urban Runoff Management Plan may be altered from time to time to conform with existing conditions.

[Source: Ord. 531, 1979]

Section 16-13-7. Annual Report by City Manager.

Section 16-13-7.5. Approval of Storm Drainage Fees--Appeal.

(a)
City Council shall approve by resolution the amount of the storm Water impact fee imposed, to pay for those improvements identified in the urban runoff management plan, and to defray the cost of particular governmental services, specifically the direct and indirect costs of development and implementation of the city's storm water management program and the design, construction, repair and maintenance of storm water and drainage related capital improvements. The fee shall be assessed on all persons or property which contribute storm water runoff. The City Council may from time to time approve an increase or decrease in the amount of storm water impact fees imposed.

(b)
The owner of any property required to pay a storm water impact fee may appeal the imposition of the fee, one time only to the City Manager or his designee within thirty (30) days following the mailing of any billing or invoice for such fee. Such appeal shall be in writing and shall state with specificity the reason or reasons that the application of the storm water impact fee to the particular property in question is not reasonably calculated to defray an equitable share of the direct and indirect costs associated with the administration of the storm water management program and the detention, retention and treatment of storm water flows attributable to the property. The City Manager or his designee may grant, deny, or grant in part and deny in part any such appeal and shall render a written decision within thirty (30) days following receipt of the appeal.

(c)
The decision of the City Manager or his designee under this section may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment pursuant to section 11-42-2 of the Northglenn Municipal Code.

The City Council shall approve any increase or decrease in the amount of storm drainage fees imposed.

Section 16-13-9. Storm Drainage Plans.

(a)
Prior to the issuance by the City of a building permit for any building or structure, other than a single family dwelling, that may result in a land disturbance of one or more acres, or result in land disturbance of less than one acre but which is part of a larger common plan of development, the property owner or building permit applicant shall submit a detailed storm drainage plan to the City, and the requested building permit shall not be issued until and unless this storm drainage plan has been approved by the City Manager or the City Manager's designee. Such plan will be reviewed from the standpoint of generally accepted engineering principles and standards in the area of storm and drainage control.

(b)
The storm drainage plan shall establish, locate, or otherwise define the alignment and boundary of any natural drainage course, drainage facility, or subdrainage area on the land in question, and it shall include drawings, profiles, and specifications for the construction and installation of channels, conduits, reservoirs, culverts, bridges, easements, and all other drainage facilities reasonably necessary to ensure that flood and storm waters, including drainage from other lands which will contribute runoff to the property in question, will be adequately drained and controlled. Included in the plan shall be a schedule containing the estimated dates of completion of construction for all storm drainage facilities shown on the plan. If and when the plan is approved and the building permit issued the applicant shall comply with the schedule.

(c)
No storm drainage plan shall be approved by the City Manager unless it conforms with the master drainage plan, and particularly that portion of the master plan which relates to the drainage basin in which the land in question is located.

(d)
The approval by the City Council, or the City's Planning Department or Planning Board of every subdivision, planned unit development, special review use, and height exception is conditioned, whether expressly stated or not, on the submission and approval of the storm drainage plan required by this section.

(e)
On-site detention storage or other reasonable runoff reduction techniques shall be required for all developments, including any individual single family lots which may disturb greater than an acre, but are not part of a larger common plan of development. All ponding or runoff reduction techniques must meet the reasonable requirements of urban hydrology, and be in conformance with applicable City and Urban Drainage and Flood Control District standards regarding water quality and quantity.

(f)
The City Manager shall have the authority to waive any or all of the requirements of this section for particular developments, or to impose additional requirements consistent with the purposes of the storm drainage and flood control regulations as set forth in the City Code, if such waiver or imposition of additional regulations is reasonably necessary due to the existence of special geological or topographical conditions.

(g)
The approved plan shall be so developed as to be integrated into the City's open space irrigation and flood storage networks, in order to permit re-use of flood waters and subsequent reapplication to cooperating farming entities in contractual relationships with the City.

Section 16-13-10. Easements for Drainage Ways. In order to achieve the purposes of this ordinance, it is necessary for the City to acquire easements for the construction and maintenance of channels along the natural drainage ways in the City as shown on the Urban Runoff Management Plan. The resulting reestablishment of the historical channels shall lessen the width of the flood plain, thereby benefiting the property through which the drainage ways flow, and permitting the owners of the property to make greater use of their land. Therefore, when the owner of a parcel of land through which a natural drainage way flows as shown on the Urban Runoff Management Plan applies for a building permit in order to develop the subject property, he shall be required to grant to the City, at no expense, a permanent easement for the purpose of constructing, maintaining, and reconstructing a channel along the drainage way.

Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the Director shall be provided, operated and maintained at the industrial user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the Director for review and shall be acceptable to the City before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the industrial user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the City under the provisions of this Article. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the Director prior to the industrial user's initiation of the changes.

(b)
The City may require industrial users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specified sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and demonstrate the industrial user's compliance with the requirements of this Article.

(c)
The City may require any industrial user discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. An Industrial Discharge Permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.

(d)
Industrial users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.

(e)
The City may require an industrial user to install at the industrial user's expense, suitable monitoring facilities or equipment that allows for the representative sampling and accurate observation of wastewater discharges. Such equipment shall be maintained in proper working order and kept safe and accessible at all times to City personnel.

(f)
The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained on the industrial user's premises outside of the building unless otherwise approved by the City. When such a location would be impractical, the City may allow such facility to be constructed in the public street or easement area, with the approval of the agency having jurisdiction over such street or easement, and located so that it will not be obstructed by public utilities, landscaping or parked vehicles.

(g)
When more than one industrial user is able to discharge into a common service line, the City may require installation of separate monitoring equipment for each industrial user.

(h)
Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the City's requirements and all applicable construction standards and specifications.

(i)
Industrial users who discharge process wastewaters determined by the City to contain pollutants necessitating continuous pH measurement to demonstrate compliance shall, subsequent to notification by the City, install a continuous recording pH meter as approved by the City. Such meter shall be installed, operated and maintained at the industrial user's own cost and expense.

(j)
If the City determines that an industrial user needs to measure and report wastewater flow, the industrial user shall install an approved flow meter. Such meter shall be installed, operated and maintained at the industrial user's own cost and expense.

Section 16-15-19. Sample Collection and Analytical Methods.

(a)
Sample Collection. Compliance determinations with respect to prohibitions and limitations in this Article may be made on the basis of either grab or composite samples of wastewater as specified by the City. Such samples shall be taken at a point or points which the City determines to be suitable for obtaining a representative sample of the discharge. Composite samples may be taken over a twenty-four (24) hour period, or over a longer or shorter time span, as determined by the City to meet specific circumstances.

(b)
Sample Type. Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, and based on data that is representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period.

(1)
Except as indicated in subparagraphs (2) and (3) below, the industrial user must collect representative wastewater samples using twenty-four (24) hour flow proportional composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is required by the City. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the City, the samples must be representative of the permitted discharge.

(2)
Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a twenty-four (24) hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composited samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the City, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous local limits, including pH.

(3)
For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in Section 16-15-23, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical representative sampling data do not exist. Where historical data are available, the City may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by Section 16-15-23, the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements.

(c)
Analytical Requirements. All pollutant analysis, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of an Industrial Discharge Permit application, report, permit or other analyses required under this Article shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the City or other parties approved by the EPA.

Section 16-15-23. Reporting Requirements.

(a)
Periodic Compliance Reports -- All Significant Industrial Users.

(1)
Any industrial user subject to a federal, state, or City Pretreatment Standard or Requirement must, at a frequency determined by the City submit no less than once per six (6) months, unless required more frequently in the permit or by the City, reports indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by Pretreatment Standards and the average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the Pretreatment Standard requires compliance with a Best Management Practices (BMPs) or pollution prevention alternatives, the industrial user must submit documentation required by the City or the Pretreatment Standard necessary to determine compliance status of the industrial user. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with Section 16-15-23(h).

(2)
All wastewater samples must be representative of the industrial user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of an industrial user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the industrial user to claim that the sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.

(3)
If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the City, using the methods and procedures prescribed in Section 16-15-19, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.

(4)
The sampling and analyses required for the reporting outlined above may be performed by the City in lieu of the permittee. Where the City itself makes arrangements with the industrial user to collect all the information required for the report, the industrial user will not be required to submit the report.

(b)
Baseline Monitoring Reports (BMR) -- Categorical Industrial Users.

(1)
Within either one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of a Categorical Pretreatment Standard, or the final administrative decision on a category determination under 40 CFR Section 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge to the POTW shall submit to the City a report which contains the information listed in paragraph (2) below. At least ninety (90) days prior to commencement of their discharge, New Sources, and sources that become Categorical Industrial Users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable Categorical Standard, shall submit to the City a report which contains the information listed in paragraph (2) below. A New Source shall report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable Pretreatment Standards. A New Source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged from regulated process streams and other non-process streams.

(2)
Industrial users described above shall submit the information set forth below.

(i)
All information required in Section 16-15-10(e).

(ii)
Measurement of pollutants.

(1)
The industrial user shall take a minimum of one (1) representative sample to compile the data necessary to comply with the requirements of this paragraph.

(2)
Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the industrial user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula in 40 Section CFR 403.6(e) in order to evaluate compliance with the Pretreatment Standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR Section 403.6(e) this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the City.

(3)
Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with Section 16-15-19.

(4)
The City may allow the submission of a BMR which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial pretreatment measures.

(5)
The BMR shall indicate the time, date, and place of sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to the POTW.

(6)
Signature and Report Certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be signed in accordance with Section 16-15-23(h) and signed by an Authorized Representative as defined in Section 16-15-2(a)(3).

(c)
90-Day Compliance Reports -- Categorical Industrial Users.

(1)
New Sources: All New Sources subject to existing Categorical Pretreatment Standards shall submit a report to the City within ninety (90) days from the date of first discharge to the POTW demonstrating actual and continuing compliance with those Standards.

(2)
Existing Sources: All Existing Sources required to comply with newly promulgated Categorical Pretreatment Standards shall submit a report to the City within ninety (90) days of the date on which compliance is required with those Standards demonstrating that actual and continuing compliance with such Standards has been achieved.

(3)
Such 90-day Compliance Report shall contain at a minimum the information required in Section 16-15-10 paragraphs (6), (7), (10), (11), and (12).

(d)
24 Hour Notice and 30 Day Re-sampling. If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation of this Article, the industrial user shall notify the City within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the City within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the violations. The industrial user is not required to resample if the following occurs:

(1)
The City performs sampling at the industrial user's facility at a frequency of at least once per month.

(2)
The City performs sampling at the industrial user's facility between the time when the industrial user performs its initial sampling and the time when the industrial user receives the results of this sampling. It is the sole responsibility of the industrial user to verify if the City has performed this sampling.

(e)
Slug/Spill Plans.

(1)
Each industrial user shall provide protection from accidental discharges and slug loads of pollutants regulated under this Article. Facilities to prevent the discharge of spills or slug loads shall be provided and maintained at the industrial user's expense.

(2)
The City shall evaluate whether each Significant Industrial User needs a Spill Prevention and Control Plan or other action to control spills and slug discharges. The City may require an industrial user to develop, submit for approval, and implement a Spill Prevention and Control Plan or take such other action that may be necessary to control spills and slug discharges.

Section 16-15-25. Sector Control Programs.

(a)
General Requirements.

(1)
Authority. The City may establish specific sector control programs for industrial users to control specific pollutants as necessary to meet the objectives of this Article. Pollutants subject to these sector control programs shall generally be controlled using Best Management Practices (BMPs) or by Permits as determined by the City.

(2)
Facility Identification and Compliance. The City shall establish and/or maintain an Industrial User Identification and Characterization Program through which industrial users shall be identified for inclusion into applicable sector control programs. Once identified and included into one or more sector control program, the facility shall be required to comply with each applicable sector control program requirements.

(3)
Notification to the City by the Industrial User and Management Review. The City shall review new construction and existing facilities undergoing any physical change, change in ownership, change in operations, or other change that could change the nature, properties, or volume of wastewater discharge, to ensure that current sector control program requirements are incorporated and implemented.

(4)
The industrial user shall inform the City prior to:

(i)
Sale or transfer of ownership of the business; or

(ii)
Change in the trade name under which the business is operated; or

(iii)
Change in the nature of the services provided that affect the potential to discharge sector control program pollutants; or

(iv)
Remodeling of the facility that may result in an increase in flow or pollutant loading or that otherwise requires the facility to submit plans or specifications for approval through a building or zoning department, or any other formal approval process of a city, county, or other jurisdiction.

(5)
Inspections.

(i)
The City may conduct inspections of any facility with or without notice for the purpose of determining applicability and/or compliance with sector control program requirements.

(ii)
If any inspection reveals non-compliance with any provision of a sector control program requirement, corrective action shall be required pursuant to the applicable sector control program.

(iii)
Inspection results will be provided in writing to the facility.

(6)
Closure. The City may require closure of plumbing, treatment devices, storage components, containments, or other such physical structures that are no longer required for their intended purpose. Closure may include the removal of equipment, the filling in and/or cementing, capping, plugging, etc.

(7)
Variance. A variance as to the requirements of any sector control program for existing facilities may be granted by the City for good cause. The facility has the burden of proof of demonstrating through data and other information why a variance should be granted. In no case shall a variance result in violation of any requirement or effluent limit specified in this Article applicable to the discharge. The granting of any variance shall be at the sole discretion of the City.

If a variance is granted, the facility shall institute Best Management Practices and other mitigation measures as specified by the City. These BMPs may include, but not be limited to:

(i)
Provide quarterly cleaning of its private service line to prevent the buildup of oil, grease and solids;

(ii)
Submit records of this cleaning to the City within fifteen (15) days of each sewer line cleaning;

(iii)
Pay the costs incurred by the City for accelerated sewer line cleaning on the City's sewer line providing service to the facility, costs to the City for treating the excess strength waste and any costs for sampling and analysis. The City believes that these costs will be comparable to costs incurred by a user that installs and maintains grease interceptors or oil/sand separators.

(8)
Enforcement and Compliance.

(i)
These requirements form a part of this Article. Enforcement of this regulation is governed by the express terms herein and the enforcement provisions of Section 16-15-27.

(ii)
Any extraordinary costs incurred by the City due to Interference, damage, Pass Through, or maintenance necessary in the treatment and/or collection system shall be paid by the industrial user to the City. The direct costs of all labor, equipment and materials incurred in rectifying the Interference or damage, including reasonable attorneys fees, shall be billed directly to the owner or the industrial user by the City, and such costs shall become part of the total charges due and owing to the City and shall constitute a lien on the industrial user until paid in full.

(b)
Program Descriptions. All facilities subject to this section must comply with the requirements in the FOG Sector Control Program which includes both the requirement for installation and operation of a sand/oil interceptor and the Best Management Practices.

(1)
Fats, Oil and Grease (FOG) Program Requirements. The requirements established in this Section shall apply to facilities subject to the FOG Sector Control Program established by the City. Non-domestic dischargers where preparation, manufacturing, or processing of food occurs include, but are not limited to, restaurants, cafes, fast food outlets, pizza outlets, delicatessens, sandwich shops, coffee shops, schools, nursing homes and other facilities that prepare, service, or otherwise make foodstuff available for consumption. These users shall install and maintain a gravity grease interceptor as directed by the City.

(i)
General Control Requirements.

(1)
A gravity grease interceptor shall be required when, in the judgment of the City, it is necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes which may be harmful to, or cause obstruction in the wastewater collection system or cause or contribute to Interference or Pass Through.

(2)
It shall be the responsibility of the industrial user and owner of the property, business or industry or an Authorized Representative of the Industrial User to contact the City for the purpose of obtaining a plan review. The plan review shall determine the need, size, location, and other requirements of the interceptor required to control discharges into the POTW. Written approval from the City must be obtained prior to installation of the interceptor. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the industrial user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the City under the provisions of this Article.

(3)
The design and sizing of gravity grease interceptors shall be in accordance with the FOG Sector Control Program in this Article. The gravity grease interceptor shall be designed, sized, installed, maintained and operated so as to accomplish their intended purpose of intercepting pollutants from the industrial user's wastewater and preventing the discharge of such pollutants to the City's wastewater collection system.

(4)
Upon change of ownership of any existing facility which would be required to have an interceptor under this Section, the applicant for sanitary sewer service shall have the burden to demonstrate that a properly sized and functioning grease interceptor is installed.

(5)
Hydromechanical grease interceptors shall not be permitted in lieu of a gravity grease interceptor to comply with the requirements of this Article.

(6)
Toilets, urinals and similar fixtures shall not waste through a gravity grease interceptor. Such fixtures shall be plumbed directly into the building sewer and waste system.

(7)
All fixtures not equipped with a garbage disposal (garbage grinder) which are connected to a gravity grease interceptor shall be equipped with a fixed or removable mesh or screen which shall catch garbage and food debris and prevent it from entering the gravity grease interceptor.

(8)
The industrial user must ensure interceptors are easily accessible for inspection, cleaning, and removal of FOG.

(9)
The industrial user must maintain interceptors at their expense and keep in efficient operating condition at all times by the regular removal of accumulated FOG.

(ii)
Required Maintenance.

(1)
Gravity grease interceptors shall be maintained by regularly scheduled cleaning so that they will properly operate as intended to efficiently intercept the fats, oil and grease from the facility's wastewater and prevent the discharge of said materials into the City's wastewater collection system. A gravity grease interceptor shall be serviced at a minimum every ninety (90) days, or more often if required by the City.

(2)
The City may require more frequent cleaning than that prescribed in 1) above. A variance from the requirement in 1) above may be obtained if the industrial user can demonstrate less frequent cleaning is sufficient.

(3)
Maintenance of gravity grease interceptors shall be done in a workman-like manner only by a business/professional normally engaged in the servicing of such plumbing fixtures.

(4)
In the event an interceptor is not properly maintained by the industrial user, owner, lessee, or other authorized representative of the facility, the City may authorize such maintenance work be performed on behalf of the industrial user. The costs of such maintenance shall be billed directly to the tenant/owner and shall become part of the charges due and owing to the City and shall constitute a lien against the property until paid in full.

(5)
Biological treatment or enzyme treatment shall not be a substitute for the servicing of gravity grease interceptors at the frequency determined by the City. Use of enzymes to emulsify FOG is prohibited.

(6)
The industrial user must document each pump-out with a waste manifest or trip ticket which must be kept on site for at least three (3) years.

(7)
The industrial user must take reasonable steps to assure that all waste is properly disposed of at a facility in accordance with federal, state and local regulations (i.e. through a certification by the hauler included on the waste manifest or trip ticket for each load).

(2)
Petroleum Oil, Grease and Sand (POGS) Separator Requirements. The requirements established in this Section shall apply to facilities subject to the POGS Program requirements established by the City.

Non-domestic dischargers where work or service is performed includes automotive service, machine shops, automotive care centers, auto body shops, car washes, or any other facility that generates sand, petroleum oil, grease or other petroleum product, grit, gravel or other aggregate that may discharge into a wastewater collection system. Access to the wastewater collection system is often via floor drains located inside shop areas that are not limited to non-polluting wastewater sources; such drains must be connected to a sand/oil interceptor.

All facilities subject to this Section must comply with the requirements in the POGS Sector Control Program which includes both the requirement for installation and operation of a sand/oil separator and the Best Management Practices.

(i)
General Control Requirements.

(1)
A sand/oil separator shall be required when, in the judgment of the City, it is necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes which may be harmful to, or cause obstruction in the wastewater collection system or cause or contribute to Interference or Pass Through.

(2)
It shall be the responsibility of the industrial user and owner of the property, business or industry or an authorized representative of the Industrial User to contact the City for the purpose of obtaining a plan review. The plan review shall determine the need, size, location, and other requirements of the interceptor required to control discharges into the POTW. Written approval from the City must be obtained prior to installation of the separator. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the industrial user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the City under the provisions of this Article.

(3)
The design and sizing of sand/oil separators shall be in accordance with the POGS Sector Control Program. The sand/oil interceptor shall be designed, sized, installed, maintained and operated so as to accomplish their intended purpose of intercepting pollutants from the industrial user's wastewater and preventing the discharge of such pollutants to the City's wastewater collection system.

(4)
Upon change of ownership of any existing facility which would be required to have a separator under this Section, the applicant for sanitary sewer service shall have the burden to demonstrate that a properly sized and functioning sand/oil separator is installed.

(5)
Toilets, urinals and similar fixtures shall not waste through a sand/oil separator. Such fixtures shall be plumbed directly into the building sewer and waste system.

(6)
The industrial user shall ensure interceptors are easily accessible for inspection, cleaning, and removal of POGS.

(7)
The industrial user shall maintain separators at their expense and keep in efficient operating condition at all times by the regular removal of POGS.

(ii)
Required Maintenance.

(1)
Sand/oil separators shall be maintained by regularly scheduled cleaning so that they will properly operate as intended to efficiently intercept the sand and oil from the POGS facility's wastewater and prevent the discharge of said materials into the City's wastewater collection system. A sand/oil separator shall be serviced at a minimum once every year, or more often as required by the City.

(2)
The City may require more frequent cleaning. A variance from this requirement may be obtained when the industrial user can demonstrate less frequent cleaning is sufficient.

(3)
Maintenance of sand/oil separators shall be done in a workman-like manner only by a business/professional normally engaged in the servicing of such plumbing fixtures.

(4)
In the event a separator is not properly maintained by the industrial user, owner, lessee, or other authorized representative of the facility, the City may authorize such maintenance work be performed on behalf of the facility. The costs of such maintenance shall be billed directly to the customer and shall become part of the charges due and owing to the City and shall constitute a lien against the property until paid in full.

(5)
The industrial user must document each pump-out with a waste manifest or trip ticket which must be kept on site for at least three (3) years.

(6)
The industrial user must take reasonable steps to assure that all waste is properly disposed of at a facility in accordance with federal, state and local regulations (i.e. through a certification by the hauler included on the waste manifest or trip ticket for each load).

Section 16-15-27. Compliance and Enforcement.

(a)
Enforcement Response Plan.

The City may adopt policies and procedures as set forth in the City's Enforcement Response Plan for carrying out the provisions of this Article, provided that such policies and procedures are not in conflict with this Article or any applicable state or federal law or regulation.

(b)
Publication of Industrial Users in Significant Noncompliance.

The City shall publish annually, in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdictions served by the POTW, a list of the Significant Industrial Users which, at any time during the previous twelve (12) months, were in Significant Noncompliance as defined in Section 16-15-2(a)(62) with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements. In addition, any industrial user found to be in Significant Noncompliance with Section 16-15-2(a)(62) paragraphs (iii), (iv), or (viii) shall also be published in the newspaper.

(c)
Administrative Enforcement Actions.

(1)
Notice of Violation (NOV). When the City finds that an industrial user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Article, an Industrial Discharge Permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the City may serve upon the industrial user a written Notice of Violation. Within five (5) working days of the receipt of such notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction of prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the industrial user to the City. Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the industrial user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation. Nothing in this Section shall limit the authority of the City to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a Notice of Violation.

(2)
Suspension of Service. The City may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or revoke an Industrial Discharge Permit (Section 16-15-13) when such revocation is necessary, in the opinion of the City, in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes Pass Through or Interference or causes the City to violate any condition of its CDPS Permit.

Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the Industrial Discharge Permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the City shall take such steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to individuals or the environment. The City may reinstate the Industrial Discharge Permit and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the non-complying discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the industrial user describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measure taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be provided to the City within five (5) days of the date of occurrence.

(3)
Administrative Compliance Order. When the City finds that an industrial user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Article, an Industrial Discharge Permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the City may issue an order to the industrial user responsible for the discharge directing that the industrial user come into compliance within a specific time. If the industrial user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the industrial user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the industrial user.

(4)
Consent Orders. The City may enter into Consent Orders, assurances of compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any industrial user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific actions to be taken by the industrial user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document.

An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventative maintenance, or careless or improper operation.

(2)
An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standards if the requirements of paragraph (3) below are met.

(3)
An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:

(i)
An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;

(ii)
The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and

(iii)
The industrial user has submitted the following information to the City within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days):

(1)
A description of the Indirect Discharge and cause of noncompliance;

(2)
The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and

(3)
Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.

(4)
In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have burden of proof.

(5)
Industrial users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standards.

(6)
Industrial users shall control (decrease) production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.

(b)
Prohibited Discharge Standards. An industrial user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in Section 16-15-7 if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause Pass Through or Interference and that either:

(1)
A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the Pass Through or Interference; or

(2)
No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the industrial user's prior discharge when the City was regularly in compliance with its CDPS permit, and in the case of Interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements; or

(3)
The industrial user disclosed the pollutants causing the violation in the Wastewater Permit Application.

All permanent BMPs of any site including, without limitation, detention basins, retention basins, ponds, inlets, outlets, outfall ditches, and structures for which the owner thereof or his or her predecessor-in-interest obtained approval from the City for the construction or establishment, shall be maintained in good repair and in substantially the form, condition and nature which was represented at the time they were constructed. It is the intention of this section that such permanent BMPs, having once been approved for construction or development, shall not be allowed to deteriorate to a condition which is in any respect inferior to the condition or state upon which the original approval for construction or development was based. For purposes of this section, either or both the owner or tenant of the structure or real property shall be considered the responsible party.

(2)
Maintenance of all permanent BMPs shall be ensured through the creation of a stormwater facility maintenance agreement that must be approved by the City and recorded in the office of the Adams or Weld County Clerk and Recorder, as applicable, prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy or Completion. The agreement shall be binding on all subsequent owners of land served by the permanent BMP. As part of the agreement, a schedule shall be developed, detailing when and how often maintenance will occur to ensure proper function of the permanent BMPs. The agreement shall also include plans for periodic inspections to ensure proper performance of the facility between scheduled maintenance. The agreement shall provide for access to the facility at reasonable times for periodic inspection or any remedial maintenance by the City, or its contractor or agent, and for regular or special assessments of property owners to ensure that the facility is maintained in proper working condition to meet design standards and any other provisions established by this article.

All permanent BMPs must undergo, at the minimum, periodic inspections by the City, as deemed appropriate by the Director, to document maintenance and repair needs and ensure compliance with the requirements of this article and accomplishment of its purposes. These needs may include removal of silt, litter and other debris from all catch basins, inlets, ponds and detention/retention basins, outlet structures and drainage pipes, cutting or removal of grass and vegetation, and necessary replacement of landscape vegetation. Any maintenance needs found by City inspection, or otherwise, must be addressed in a timely manner, as determined in writing by the Director. The inspection and maintenance requirement may be increased as deemed necessary to ensure proper functioning of the permanent BMPs.

(2)
nspection programs may be established by the City on any reasonable basis, including, but not limited to: routine inspections; random inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible violations; inspection of drainage basins or areas identified as higher than typical sources of sediment or other contaminants or pollutants; inspections of businesses or industries of a type associated with higher than usual discharges of contaminants or pollutants or with discharges of a type which are more likely than the typical discharge to cause violations of state or federal water quality standards or the CDPS stormwater permit; and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are not limited to, reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and material or water in drainage control facilities; and evaluating the condition of drainage control facilities and other stormwater treatment practices.

(3)
When any permanent BMP is installed on private property, or when any new connection is made between private property and a public drainage control system, the property owner shall grant to the City the right to enter the property at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the purpose of inspection. This includes the right to enter a property when the City has a reasonable basis to believe that a violation of this article is occurring or has occurred, and to enter when necessary for abatement of a public nuisance or correction of a violation of this article.

(4)

(D)
The City may release percent portions of the performance bond in increments of no less than twenty-five (25) at the discretion of the Director upon written request of the applicant. In such case, an amended performance bond shall be required. In no case shall the full amount of the performance bond be released until final acceptance has been granted and all BMP improvements have been constructed and approved.

(E)
After all repairs are made at the end of the warranty period and final acceptance is issued, the performance bond will be released.

(e)
If the permittee does not successfully complete all required work or violates any requirement of the permit or this article, the City may take corrective measures and charge the cost of such to the permittee. Such costs shall include the actual cost of any work deemed necessary by the City plus reasonable administrative and inspection costs and penalties pursuant to this code. If the total of such costs exceeds the performance bond, the permittee shall be responsible for payment of the remaining balance within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of an accounting of such from the City.

Whenever the decision of the Authority suspending a license or permit becomes final, whether by failure of the licensee to appeal the decision or by exhaustion of all appeals and judicial review, the licensee may, before the operative date of the suspension, petition for permission to pay a fine in lieu of the license or permit suspension for all or part of the suspension period. Upon the receipt of the petition, the Authority may, in its sole discretion, stay the proposed suspension and cause any investigation to be made that it deems desirable and may, in its sole discretion, grant the petition if it is satisfied:

That the public welfare and morals would not be impaired by permitting the licensee to operate during the period set for suspension and that the payment of the fine will achieve the desired disciplinary purposes; and

(2)
That the books and records of the licensee are kept in such a manner that the loss of sales of alcohol beverages that the licensee would have suffered had the suspension gone into effect can be determined with reasonable accuracy.

(a)
For purposes of this subsection (14), it shall be presumed that a designated security representative be sufficient, where appropriate, for events with less than one hundred (100) people in attendance. For events of one hundred (100) people or more, the applicant shall provide private security at a ratio of at least one private security officer per one hundred (100) attendees.

A permit may be denied, or conditions imposed, on the grounds that approval would be detrimental to the public safety, health, morals, order or welfare by reason of the nature of the event, the likelihood that the event would create a public nuisance or result in the consumption of alcoholic beverages by minors, its location within the community, or the failure of the applicant to conduct a past event in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

The request may also be denied if another event has previously been scheduled for that location on the same day and time, or if the event would unreasonably interfere with normal activities and customary and general use and enjoyment of the facility.

Section 18-3-3. License Fee. The City finds, determines and declares that considering the nature of the pawnbroker business and the relationship of such business to the municipal welfare, as well as the relationship thereto to the expenditures required of the City and all other matters properly to be considered in relation thereto, the classification of such business as a separate type of business or occupation requiring a separate license fee is reasonable, proper, uniform, nondiscriminatory, and necessary for a just and proper distribution of costs for City services. Accordingly, the City hereby levies and assesses for each year an annual City pawnbroker license fee. The annual license fee for carrying on the business of pawnbroking shall be five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) payable in advance. Any license issued pursuant to this article shall expire on the thirty-first (31st) day of December of every year. Fees required under this article may be prorated as follows, when the license granted is not a renewal: one-quarter (1/4) of the fee for each quarter or fraction thereof remaining in the year.

If the investigation reveals that any applicant, partner, officer, director and/or holder of ten percent (10%) or more of the corporate stock of a corporate applicant or any of the managers, does not meet these criteria, the City Clerk will deny the applicant's request for a pawnbroker license.

(c)

NON-ALCOHOLIC DANCE CLUBS
Section 18-13-1. Title. This ordinance shall be known and cited as the Northglenn Non-Alcoholic Dance Club Ordinance.

[Source: Ord. 1237, 1999]

Section 18-13-2. Legislative Declaration. The City Council hereby finds and declares that the operation of Non-Alcoholic Dance Clubs within the City requires regulation. Such businesses customarily attract large numbers of patrons at late hours, many of whom have been consuming alcoholic beverages and who come to the Non-Alcoholic Dance club only after liquor licensed establishments have closed.

ARTICLE 14
MEDICAL MARIJUANA
Section 18-14-1. Findings and Legislative Intent. The City Council makes the following legislative findings:

(a)
The City Council finds that on November 7, 2000, the voters of the State of Colorado approved Amendment 20. Amendment 20 added Section 14 of Article XVIII to the Colorado Constitution and created a limited exception from criminal liability under Colorado law (as opposed to federal law) for seriously ill persons who are in need of marijuana for specified medical purposes and who obtain and use medical marijuana under the limited, specified circumstances described in Amendment 20.

(b)
The City Council finds and determines that the Colorado Medical Marijuana Code, C.R.S.  12-43.3-101, et seq., clarifies Colorado law regarding the scope and extent of Amendment 20 to the Colorado Constitution.

(c)
The City Council finds and determines that the Colorado Medical Marijuana Code now provides a statutory framework for the regulation of medical marijuana centers, cultivation facilities and marijuana-infused product manufacturing operations.

(d)
The City Council finds and determines that, by requiring that medical marijuana businesses be operated in a manner that minimizes potential health and safety risks, it mitigates the negative impacts that a medical marijuana center might have on surrounding properties and persons.

(e)
The City Council finds and determines that through this Ordinance it intends to establish a nondiscriminatory mechanism by which the City can control, through appropriate regulation, the location and operation of medical marijuana centers, optional premises cultivation operations, or medical marijuana-infused product manufacturing facilities within the City.

(f)
The City Council recognizes and affirms the protections afforded by Article XVIII, Section 14 of the Colorado Constitution and desires to affirm the ability of patients and primary caregivers to otherwise be afforded the protections of Article XVIII, Section 14 of the Colorado Constitution and C.R.S.  25-1.5-106, as the same may be amended from time to time.

(a)
The City Council finds that on November 6, 2012, the voters of the State of Colorado approved Amendment 64.

(b)
The City Council finds and determines that the enactment by the Colorado Legislature of the Colorado Retail Marijuana Code, C.R.S.  12-43.4-101, et seq., clarifies Colorado law regarding the scope and extent of Amendment 64 to the Colorado Constitution.

(c)
The City Council finds and determines that the Colorado Retail Marijuana Code now provides a statutory framework for the regulation of retail marijuana establishments.

(d)
The City Council finds and determines that, by requiring that retail marijuana businesses be operated in a manner that minimizes potential health and safety risks, it mitigates the negative impacts that retail marijuana establishments might have on surrounding properties and persons.

(e)
The City Council finds and determines that through this Ordinance it intends to establish a nondiscriminatory mechanism by which the City can control, through appropriate regulation, the location and operation of retail marijuana establishments within the City.

(f)
The City Council recognizes and affirms the protections afforded by Article XVIII, Section 16 of the Colorado Constitution and desires to affirm the ability of persons twenty-one (21) years of age and older the protections of Article XVIII, Section 16 of the Colorado Constitution, the Retail Marijuana Code, and all associated regulations, as the same may be amended from time to time.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
Section 21-2-1. General. No sign shall be erected, mounted, displayed, maintained or remodeled unless it is in full compliance with this Sign Code, with the regulations for the zone in which it is located, and with all applicable laws of the City of Northglenn and the State of Colorado. The general provisions of this Article shall apply to all signs except signs erected, mounted, displayed, maintained or remodeled on property owned, controlled or maintained by the Federal Government, the State or the City, including public streets, alleyways, sidewalks, rights-of-way, trails, easements, parks and other spaces.

Section 21-2-2. Substitution. Subject to the land owner's consent, a noncommercial message of any type may be substituted for any duly permitted or allowed commercial message or any duly permitted or allowed noncommercial message; provided, that the sign structure or mounting device is lawful without consideration of message content. Such substitution of message may be made without any additional approval or permitting. This provision prevails over any more specific provision to the contrary within this chapter. The purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over noncommercial speech, or favoring of any particular noncommercial message over any other noncommercial message. This provision does not create a right to increase the total amount of signage on a parcel, nor does it affect the requirement that a sign structure or mounting device be properly permitted.

For a wall sign without a distinguishable frame or outline, the area shall be determined by the following:

(A)
The area of the sign shall encompass a regular geometric shape (rectangle, circle, trapezoid, triangle, etc.), or a combination of regular geometric shapes, which form, or approximate, the perimeter of all elements in the display, the frame, and any applied background that is not part of the architecture of the building.

(B)
When multiple elements are organized to form a single sign, but are separated by open space, the sign area and dimensions shall be calculated by determining the geometric form, or combination of forms, which comprises all of the display area, including the space between different elements.

(C)
Minor appendages to a particular regular shape, as determined by the Director, shall not be included in the total area of a sign.

(b)
