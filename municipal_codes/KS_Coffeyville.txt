PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Coffeyville, Kansas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1977 Code, as supplemented through November 14, 1988, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the Board of Commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1977 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 RELATED LAWS RL:1 SPECIAL ACTS SA:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 RELATED LAWS COMPARATIVE TABLE RLCT:1 SPECIAL ACTS COMPARATIVE TABLE SACT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Sandra S. Fox, Senior Code Attorney, and Kellyn Wilcox, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Paul M. Kritz for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that his efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

    It is unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to change or amend by additions or deletions, any part or portion of this Code, or to insert or delete pages, or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner whatsoever which will cause the law of the city to be misrepresented thereby.

Sec. 1-13. - Applicability of Code and ordinances to city-owned property outside city limits. 
    The provisions of this Code shall apply to all real property belonging to the city outside the corporate city limits, and shall be in full effect within the boundaries of all such outlying real property, insofar as they are applicable. All ordinances of the city which shall go into effect in the future shall also apply to, and be in full effect within, the boundaries of all such outlying real property insofar as they may be applicable.

(c)  If any of the provisions hereof conflict, and the conflict cannot be resolved by application of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the more stringent regulation shall apply, and the specific provision shall prevail over the general. 
Sec. 1-15. - Severability of parts of Code. 
    It is hereby declared to be the intention of the board of commissioners that the sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this Code are severable and, if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this Code shall be held invalid or unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and sections of this Code, since the same would have been enacted by the board of commissioners without the incorporation in this Code of any such invalid or unconstitutional phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section.

(c)  Costs . Any reasonable costs incurred in seizing, impounding, euthanizing or confining any dangerous animal shall be the responsibility of the owner of such animal.

Sec. 6-181. - Dangerous dogs. 
(a)  If the animal control officer or a law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe a dog is dangerous, as defined in section 6-1, the city attorney may file a petition with the municipal court, verified by the animal control officer or law enforcement officer, seeking a determination that the dog is dangerous. If the city intends to seek an order from the court that the dog be euthanized, the petition shall specifically identify that as the remedy requested. 
(b)  The city attorney shall provide the owner of the dog with a copy of the petition, and written notice of the date, time, and location of the hearing. 
(c)  When the animal control officer or a law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that the subject dog may pose a threat of serious harm to human beings or other animals, the officer is authorized to seize and impound the dog pending the hearing and/or any appeal. If the subject dog has been impounded, the matter shall be scheduled for a hearing within ten business days from the date of impoundment. If the dog is not impounded, the hearing shall be held within 30 days from the date the petition is filed in the municipal court. These deadlines may be extended by the court for good cause shown. 
(d)  The hearing shall be conducted by the municipal judge, who will sit as an administrative judge for purposes of this section. As administrative judge, he is empowered to hold hearings, subpoena witnesses, take the testimony of persons under oath, and require the production of any evidence relating to any matter being heard. 
(e)  At the hearing, all interested parties shall be given an opportunity to present testimony and relevant materials on the issue of whether the dog in question is dangerous. The testimony and relevant materials may include, but not be limited to, animal control reports, the facts, circumstances, and seriousness of any attack or wound, past history of wounds inflicted by the dog in question, and the potential propensity of the dog to inflict wounds in the future. The hearing shall be civil in nature, informal in the presentation of the testimony, and open to the public. 
(f)  If the court, after hearing the testimony and reviewing the relevant materials, determines that the city has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the dog meets the definition of dangerous dog, the dog shall be deemed dangerous. In addition, the court has the authority to order the dog removed from the city, or destruction of the dog, as it deems appropriate. Future compliance hearings and/or the requirement to post bond to ensure compliance or to perfect an appeal may be ordered at the discretion of the court. If the owner fails to comply with the provisions of this section within the time frame ordered, unless stayed by the filing of an appeal, the dog shall be ordered destroyed. 
(g)  If the dog is ordered to be removed from the city, the owner shall pay all applicable impoundment and boarding fees, before the dog may be released. If the owner appeals the court's decision, the dog shall be impounded pending the determination on appeal, and all associated boarding costs shall be the responsibility of the owner. If the dog is determined not to be dangerous, it may be released to its owner immediately upon payment of all impoundment and boarding fees. 
(h)  Hearing. 
(1)  The failure of an owner to appear at a hearing, or the removal of the dog from the city prior to the scheduled hearing, does not preclude the court from holding a hearing and/or determining that the dog is dangerous. In addition to any other order, the court may order the owner to provide animal control with the exact location, address, and contact information for the new owner of the dog (if moved), and require that the animal not be returned to the city. 
(2)  If an owner desires to contest the court's determination that a dog is dangerous, he may appeal to the district court. The owner shall file a notice of appeal with the municipal court clerk within ten days of the court's determination. If the dog has been impounded, the court may require that the owner post a bond in an amount sufficient to pay for the animal's current impoundment and boarding fees, and a minimum of 30 additional days boarding, which shall also be required within ten days of the court's determination. The dog shall remain impounded until a final determination is made on appeal. The municipal court clerk will prepare the record on appeal, similar to an appeal from a municipal court pursuant to K.S.A. 12-4602 and 22-3609, and amendments thereto, and submit the record to the district court. The district court shall review the matter de novo, and the city's burden of proof shall be the preponderance of the evidence. 
(3)  The owner of a dog subject to a petition seeking a dangerous determination may waive his right to a hearing and enter a stipulation that the dog is dangerous, or a stipulation that the evidence would be sufficient to sustain a finding that the dog is dangerous. Any such stipulation shall be reduced to writing and signed by the owner. A stipulation shall have the same legal effect as a determination by the court that the dog is dangerous. 
(i)  For purposes of this chapter, a dog that is stipulated to be dangerous under this section shall be synonymous with a dog determined to be dangerous by the court. Further, entering into a stipulation is not an appealable order.

(1)  Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, and sexual assault and exploitation. 
(2)  Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area. 
(3)  Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the city's rationale for this chapter, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the city's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the city. The city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this section are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects. 
(4)  The city adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and legislative record related to the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses, including the judicial opinions and reports related to such secondary effects. 
Sec. 10-105. - Entry for purposes of inspection. 
(a)  Any business that engages in the exchange, rental, or sale of adult media if such business is not open to the public in general but only to one or more classes of the public, excluding any minor by reason of age, or if a substantial or significant portion of such items are distinguished or characterized by an emphasis on the depiction or description of specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas shall be deemed to have consented to periodic entry into and inspection of the business premises by appropriate city officials and inspection by those officials of only those business records necessary for the limited purpose of determining whether such business enterprise is in compliance with this article. 
(b)  Entry and inspection shall take place during hours when such business is open to the public, unless otherwise requested by the business, and shall not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of such business.

The arrangement and design standards of streets shall conform to the provisions found herein: 
(1)  The arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing principal streets in surrounding areas, or conform to a plan for the neighborhood, approved or adopted by the planning and zoning commission, to meet a particular situation where topographical or other conditions make continuation or conformance to existing streets impracticable. 
(2)  When a new subdivision adjoins unsubdivided land susceptible of being subdivided, then the new streets shall be carried to the boundaries of the tract proposed to be subdivided. 
(3)  Streets that are obviously in alignment with others already existing and named shall bear the name of the existing streets. No street name shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with the name of any existing street in the city. Street names shall be subject to the approval of the planning and zoning commission. 
(4)  Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. 
(5)  Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way, the planning and zoning commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes in residential districts, or for commercial or industrial purposes in appropriate districts.

(Code 1977, § 26-36; Ord. No. G-92-02, § 1, 1-27-1992) 
Sec. 42-5. - Rules and regulations deemed part of utility service agreement; application of service. 
(a)  The rules and regulations herein contained shall constitute and be a part of the utility service agreement with every person, company or corporation who is supplied with utilities from the city. 
(b)  Every person, company or corporation (sometimes referred to as the "customer" herein), who accepts and uses utilities from the city, shall be held to have consented to be bound by the rates, rules and regulations herein contained, and no utilities shall be furnished by the utility departments except in accordance with this chapter. 
(c)  Applicants must apply in the city's customer service office. Applicants must show proof of identification, a driver's license or other photo identification card. If the applicant is leasing the property, a current lease must be provided. 
(d)  All applications for utility service shall be made in writing upon a utility service agreement blank furnished by the customer service office and shall contain all the information required by both the service department and the billing office, together with an agreement to comply with the provisions of this article, and any amendments thereto, as a part of the term of the utility service agreement between the applicant and the department of the city. 
(e)  All utility service agreements must be made in the name of the head of the household, firm or corporation using the established spelling of that person's or firm's name. Attempts to obtain service by the use of t other names, different spellings or by substituting other persons or firms will be considered an act of deceit and service will be denied. If service had been discontinued because of nonpayment of bills or any unpaid obligation, and service again has been obtained through an act of deceit, misrepresentation or fraud, that service will be promptly disconnected, and the whole or such part of the security deposit as may be necessary to satisfy the unpaid obligation shall be retained by the collector and credited to the proper account. Any person providing false information including a false name, address or credit rating to obtain service from the city shall be guilty of an offense against the city ordinances. 
(f)  It shall be unlawful for any person to draw, use or consume utility services from the city utility systems without proper authority as evidenced by a valid contract as provided for in this article. 
Sec. 42-6. - Rates incorporated.

(a)  At the time application is made for utility service the applicant must deposit with the department, as a security deposit, an amount as stated on the city's fee schedule. 
(b)  Residential customers who present confirmable written evidence of a good payment record, as provided herein, while customers of another electric utility in the United States, or with the city, for the most recent 12 consecutive months during the previous three years, will have the security deposit requirement waived for their residence. This letter of credit must state that the applicant had services for 12 consecutive months with no arrears, delinquencies, NSF checks or late payments for the entire 12 consecutive months. However, any customer with an outstanding collectible bill with the department shall not be granted the courtesy of using a letter of credit from another utility, nor shall their deposit be waived for a good paying record with the department. Before services are connected, the customer will be required to pay the outstanding uncollectible bill as well as the appropriate security deposit. Credit information must be received prior to connection of service. 
(c)  Residential security deposits shall be refunded, with interest, to the applicant after one year in good standing with the city, so long as the refund amount exceeds $5.00. Security deposits in the amount of $5.00 or less shall be transferred to the applicable utility funds. 
(d)  Commercial security deposits for new commercial service, including, but not limited to non-profit organizations and churches, shall be computed based on one-sixth of the estimated annual billing for each utility based on the usage as determined by the department. For established locations, the most recent 12 months' active billing history for the previous customer may be used and the deposit may be based on one-sixth annual billing for that previous customer, or, if the business or its mode of operation is, in the opinion of the department, substantially different from the previous customer, the deposit may be computed by the department for one-sixth of the estimated annual billing for the location. Any expansion or increase in estimated usage for an established location may result in an increase in the deposit equal to one-sixth of the estimated annual increase in billing for the location. The deposit shall be in accordance with the city's fee schedule. 
(e)  For commercial accounts, in lieu of any cash security deposit, the department may, at its discretion, accept a bond executed by the applicant, as principal, and a solvent surety company qualified to do business in the state, as surety, conditioned that the principal therein shall timely and faithfully pay to the department any and all sums due for the utility services. In addition, in lieu of a cash security deposit or a bond, the department may accept an irrevocable letter of credit from a bank or other financial institution qualified to issue such letters of credit. Upon expiration, said bond or letter of credit shall be renewed or a cash deposit made. Failure to do either will constitute grounds for discontinuance of services, or other action deemed necessary by the department. In no event shall a surety bond or letter of credit executed by a personal surety be permitted to substitute for the required security deposit. 
(f)  If the applicant has a delinquent utility debt with the city, payment of the delinquent amount, plus a double security deposit shall be required in order to establish service with the city. Double deposits shall not be refunded to the customer until utility service with the city is terminated. 
(g)  Interest shall be paid on all deposits annually in January as a credit on the January bill. Upon termination of utility service, the security deposit thus provided for, shall be applied to any remaining utility charges outstanding at the time of final customer disconnect. 
Sec. 42-8. - Meter reading, billing and collecting. 
(a)  Meters will normally be read each month. The day of the month for reading any meter will, as closely as practicable, be on the same day each month, but there will be a three-day allowance each way to take care of Saturdays, Sundays and holidays or other unusual conditions. 
(b)  The department will read meters at least once every four months where auto transportation is required for such readings. 
(c)  In the months when meters are not read, meter readings will be estimated by the department and bills will be rendered on the basis of these estimated readings. However, if a customer desires to submit the meter readings by postcard and will do so in time for billing, the department will provide the postcards for this purpose. Meter readings may also be submitted on the city's website. 
(d)  The department may estimate meter readings for fractional month's use and render bills on these estimated meter readings. 
(e)  The department may estimate meter readings where the meter reader is unable to gain access to the premises to read the meter on his regular meter trip. 
(f)  In the event an adjustment is due a customer as the result of a faulty meter, meter reading, or billing error, the department will limit the adjustment to the previous 180 days after the discovery of the error. 
(g)  Monthly bills will be rendered net, payable on or before the due date set forth on the bill. Cash payment may be required. 
(h)  Failure to receive a bill shall not excuse a customer from his obligation to pay within the time specified. Should the department be unable to bill a customer for utilities used during any month, the billing next made shall include the charges for energy used during the unbilled month. A "month" shall be considered as that period of approximately 30 days. 
(i)  All bills must be paid prior to customers transferring service to another location. A transfer fee shall be charged to customers transferring service from one address to another, in accordance with the city's fee schedule. 
(j)  Service shall not be established at a property rented or leased to another if the owner of the property has a past due utility bill with the city, until such time as such past due utility bill is paid in full. For all utility bills for the previous month's service not paid when due, a late charge of five percent will be added to the bill. 
(k)  The right to discontinue service for default may be exercised whenever and as often as default shall occur and neither delay nor omission on the part of the department to enforce this rule at any one or more times shall be deemed a waiver of its rights to enforce the same at any time, so long as the default continues. 
Sec. 42-9. - Same; delinquent notice; hearing and termination. 
(a)  When any utility account shall become delinquent as herein provided, the utility office shall cause a notice of such delinquency to be sent to the customer by regular or electronic mail, or by text message, to the customer's address, email address, or mobile device number on file, stating: 
(1)  The amount due on the unpaid balance. 
(2)  Notice that service will be terminated if the account is not fully paid by the date stated in the notice. 
(3)  If service is terminated, service will not be reinstated without payment of the entire past due amount. Re-connection is also subject to payment of a re-connection fee in accordance with the city's fee schedule, which must be paid prior to the re-connection. 
(4)  Once the serviceman appears at the residence or business to disconnect service, arrangements cannot be made with the serviceman at that time to continue service. The service will be cut and the past due amount must be paid in full along with the re-connect charge. Arrangements can only be made through the customer service office for continuance of service, and this must be done prior to disconnection. 
(5)  A customer may request a payment extension if he is unable to pay a past due bill by the cutoff date. If the customer fails to request an extension and complete the necessary paperwork by the cutoff date, service shall be disconnected without further notice. Any extension made under the low income energy assistance program (LIEAP) should be only for the amount of the LIEAP payment. The amount of LIEAP payment and the date of receipt shall be confirmed. Only one extension shall be allowed per calendar quarter. No extension shall be allowed on an extension, and no customer who is already a party to a utility payment contract with the city shall be permitted to have a payment extension. In no case will extensions be given when the past due bill is already more than 30 days past due. 
(6)  Only one extension shall be allowed per calendar quarter. No extension shall be allowed on an extension. If more than 30 days past due, no extension will be made. 
(b)  In the case of fraudulent use or unauthorized reconnection of services, the department may discontinue service without notice, and the city shall impose a tampering fee in accordance with the city's fee schedule.

(d)  City requirements . 
(1)  The city shall have the authority to determine and implement, by ordinance, local limits for prohibited discharge if its investigations demonstrates that they are needed. If a local limit on a discharge exists and the local limit is more stringent those found in corresponding federal categorical standards, the more stringent local limit shall apply to the industrial user. 
(2)  If the city determines that separate local limits are not necessary, it shall so demonstrate such to KDHE or EPA, upon request of either agency. 
(e)  Dilution prohibited . No person shall ever increase the use or process water or, in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with limitations unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement.

Sec. 42-216. - Purpose and policy. 
    The provisions of this division set forth requirements for industrial users of the wastewater collection and POTW for the city and enables the city to comply with applicable state and federal laws, including the Clean Water Act (33 USC 1251 et seq.) and the general pretreatment regulations (40 CFR part 403). The objectives of this division are: 
(1)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW that will interfere with the operation of the POTW; 
(2)  To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTW which will pass through the POTW, inadequately treated, into receiving waters or otherwise be incompatible with the POTW; 
(3)  To ensure that the quality of the wastewater treatment plant sludge is maintained at a level which allows its use and disposal in compliance with applicable statutes and regulations; 
(4)  To protect POTW personnel who may be affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and to protect the general public; 
(5)  To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and sludge from the POTW; 
(6)  To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of operation, maintenance and improvement of the POTW; and 
(7)  To enable the city to comply with its NPDES permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements and any other federal or state laws to which the POTW is subject. 
(Code 1977, § 26-83; Ord. No. G-92-02, § 1, 1-27-1992) 
Sec. 42-217. - Applicability. 
(a)  This division shall apply to all industrial users of the POTW. This division authorizes the issuance of wastewater discharge permits; authorizes monitoring, compliance and enforcement activities; establishes administrative review procedures; requires industrial user reporting; and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein. 
(b)  This division shall apply to persons who are, by permit with the city, users of the POTW. Except as otherwise provided herein, the director shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this section. All compliance monitoring or self-monitoring data must be provided by a laboratory that has a current KDHE certification. 
(Code 1977, § 26-84; Ord. No. G-92-02, § 1, 1-27-1992) 
Sec. 42-218. - Industrial pretreatment. 
    Upon the promulgation of national pretreatment standards for a particular industrial subcategory, the pretreatment standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed under this division for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this division. The city shall notify all affected industrial users of the applicable reporting requirements contained in nation pretreatment standards, including requirements outlined in 40 CFR 403.12. 
(Code 1977, § 26-85; Ord. No. G-92-02, § 1, 1-27-1992) 
Sec. 42-219. - Pretreatment facilities. 
    Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the industrial user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the industrial user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an acceptable discharge to the city under the provisions of this division. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to, and acceptable to the city prior to initiation of the changes. 
(Code 1977, § 26-86; Ord. No. G-92-02, § 1, 1-27-1992) 
Sec. 42-220. - Accidental discharge/slug control plans. 
    The director may require any industrial user to develop and implement an accidental discharge/slug control plan. At least once every two years, the director shall evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs such a plan. Any industrial user required to develop and implement an accidental discharge/slug control plan shall submit a plan which addresses, at a minimum, the following: 
(1)  Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges. 
(2)  Description of stored chemicals. 
(3)  Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental or slug discharge. Such notification must also be given for any discharge that would violate any of the prohibited discharges in section 42-190(a). 
(4)  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas; handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and measures and equipment for emergency response. 
(5)  Confidentiality of information. Information and data on an industrial user obtained from reports, questionnaires, monitoring programs and inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents), and measures and equipment for emergency response.

At least 90 days prior to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical standard, shall be required to submit to the city a report which contains the information listed in subsection (a)(2) of this section. A new source shall also be required to report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. A new source shall also give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants discharged. 
(2)  The industrial user shall submit the information required by this section including: 
a.  Identifying information . The name and address of the facility including the name of the operator and owners. 
b.  Wastewater discharge permits . A list of any environmental control wastewater discharge permits held by or for the facility. 
c.  Description of operations . A brief description of the nature, average rate of production, and standard industrial classifications of the operations carried out by such industrial user. This description should include a schematic process diagram which indicates points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes. 
d.  Flow measurement . Information showing the measured average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from regulated process streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of the combined wastestream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
e.  Measurement of pollutants . 
1.  Identify the categorical pretreatment standards applicable to each regulated process. 
2.  Submit the results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concentration (or mass, where required by the standard or by the city) of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated process. Instantaneous, daily maximum and long term average concentrations (or mass, where required) shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in subsection (j) of this section. 
3.  Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set out in subsection (k) of this section. 
f.  Certification . A statement reviewed by the industrial user's authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 
g.  Compliance schedule . If additional pretreatment or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the industrial user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. 
h.  All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 42-224(f). 
(b)  Compliance schedule progress report . The following conditions shall apply to the schedule required by subsection (a)(2)g of this section. The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, beginning and conducting routine operation). No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months. The industrial user shall submit a progress report to the director no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the industrial user to return to the established schedule. In no event shall more than nine months' elapse between such progress reports to the director. 
(c)  Report on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline . Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any industrial user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the city a report containing the information described in subsection (a)(2)d-f of this section. For industrial users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedure in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the industrial user's long term production rate. For all other industrial users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the industrial user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 42-224(f). 
(d)  Periodic compliance reports . 
(1)  Any significant industrial user subject to a pretreatment standard shall, at a frequency determined by the director but in no case less than twice per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by such pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 42-224(f). 
(2)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the industrial user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of an industrial user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the industrial user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(3)  If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in and of this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the POTW, using the procedure prescribed in subsection (k) of this section the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
(e)  Report of changed conditions . Each industrial user is required to notify the director of any planned significant changes to the industrial user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality or volume of its wastewater at least 90 days before the change. 
(1)  The director may require the industrial user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under section 42-224. 
(2)  The director may issue a wastewater discharge permit under section 42-224(g) or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under section 42-225(d). 
(3)  No industrial user shall implement the planned changed conditions until and unless the director has responded to the industrial user's notice. 
(4)  For purposes of this requirement flow increases of ten percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants, shall be deemed significant. 
(f)  Reports of potential problems . 
(1)  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge, or a slug load which may cause potential problems for the POTW (including a violation of the prohibited discharge standards in section 42-190(a)), it is the responsibility of the industrial user to immediately telephone and notify the city of the incident. This notification shall include the location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the industrial user. 
(2)  Within five days following such discharge, the industrial user shall, unless waived by the director, submit a detailed written report describing the causes of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to a person or property; nor shall notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this division. 
(3)  Failure to notify the city of potential problem discharges shall be deemed a separate violation of this division. 
(4)  A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (f)(1) of this section. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause or suffer such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
(g)  Reports from nonsignificant industrial users . All industrial users not subject to categorical pretreatment standards and not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the city as the director may require. 
(h)  Notice of violation; repeat sampling and reporting . If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the industrial user must notify the city within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the city within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user is not required to resample if the POTW performs monitoring at the industrial user's site at least once a month, or if the POTW performs sampling between the industrial user's initial sampling and when the industrial user receives the results of this sampling. 
(i)  Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste . 
(1)  Any industrial user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more than ten kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under subsection (e) of this section. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of this section. 
(2)  Discharges are exempt from the requirements of subsection (i)(1) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous wasted do not require additional notification. 
(3)  In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the POTW, the EPA regional waste management waste division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(4)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(j)  Analytical requirements . All pollutants analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed by a laboratory currently certified by KDHE in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA. 
(k)  Sample collection. 
(1)  Except as indicated in subsection (k)(2) of this section, the industrial user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the director may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or through a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
(2)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, toxicity, sulfides, and volatile organic chemicals must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(l)  Determination of noncompliance . The director may use grab samples to determine noncompliance with treatment standards. 
(m)  Timing . Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the U.S. Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(n)  Recordkeeping . Industrial users shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records and information required to be retained under this division. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning compliance with this division, or where the industrial user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the director.

Sec. 42-253. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
(a)  Upset . 
(1)  For the purposes of this section, the term "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(2)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (a)(3) of this section are met. 
(3)  An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause or causes of the upset; 
b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; 
c.  The industrial user has submitted the following information to the POTW and treatment plant operator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days): 
1.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance. 
2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, of not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue. 
3.  Steps being taken or being planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(4)  In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(5)  Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(6)  The industrial user shall control production or all discharge to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure or its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
(b)  General/specific prohibitions . An industrial user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in section 42-190(a) if it can prove that it did not know or have reason to know that its discharge, along or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(c)  Bypass . 
(1)  Definitions. 
a.  The term "bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of an industrial user's treatment facility. 
b.  The term "severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which caused them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. The term "severe property damage" does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(2)  Exceptions. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (c)(3) and (4) of this section. 
(3)  Notice. 
a.  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW, at least ten days before the date of the bypass if possible. 
b.  An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the POTW within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(4)  Requirements for approval. 
a.  Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless: 
1.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
2.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
3.  The industrial user submitted notices as required under subsection (c)(3) of this section. 
b.  The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (c)(4)a of this section.

    All developers and contractors on sites of construction activity, that require a federal or state NPDES stormwater discharge permit, or that are part of a common plan of development or sale requiring said permit, shall comply with the following requirements (in addition to those in section 42-371): 
(1)  Any developer who intends to obtain coverage for stormwater discharges from a construction site under the state general permit for stormwater discharges from sites (the construction general permit) shall submit a signed copy of its notice of intent (NOI) to the authorized enforcement agency when a building permit application is made. When ownership of the site changes, a revised NOI shall be submitted within 15 days of the change in ownership. 
(2)  A stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWP3) shall be prepared and implemented in accordance with the requirements of the construction general permit or any individual or group NPDES permit issued for stormwater discharges from the site, and with any additional requirement imposed by or under this article and any other city ordinance. 
(3)  The SWP3 shall be prepared by a qualified person and shall comply with state NPDES requirements. The signature of the preparer shall constitute his attestation that the SWP3 fully complies with the requirements of the permit issued. 
(4)  The SWP3 shall be completed prior to the submittal of the NOI to the authorized enforcement agency and for new construction, prior to the commencement of construction activities. The SWP3 shall be updated and modified as appropriate and as required by the NPDES permit. 
(5)  The authorized enforcement agency may require any developer who is required by subsection (2) of this section to prepare a SWP3, to submit the SWP3, and any modifications thereto, to the authorized enforcement agency for review at any time. 
(6)  Upon the authorized enforcement agency's review of the SWP3 and any site inspection that the authorized enforcement agency may conduct, if the SWP3 is not being fully implemented, the authorized enforcement agency may upon reasonable notice to the developer, deny approval of any building permit, grading permit, site development plan, final occupancy certificate, or any other city approval necessary to commence or continue construction. A stop work order may also be issued. 
(7)  All contractors working on a site subject to an NPDES permit shall comply with all requirements of the SWP3. All contractors will be responsible for their own activities to ensure that they comply with the developer's SWP3. Failure to comply with the SWP3 or malicious destruction of BMP devices is hereby deemed to be a violation of this article. 
(8)  The SWP3, and modifications attached, shall be retained at the construction site or at a local office of the developer from the date of construction commencement through the date of final stabilization. 
(9)  The authorized enforcement agency may notify the developer at any time that the SWP3 does not meet the requirements of the NPDES permit issued or any additional requirement imposed by or under this article. Such notification shall identify those provisions of the permit or article which are not being met by the SWP3, and identify which provisions of the SWP3 require modification in order to meet such requirements. Within 30 days of such notification from the authorized enforcement agency, the developer shall make the required changes to the SWP3 and shall submit to the authorized enforcement agency a written certification from the developer that the requested changes have been made. 
(10)  The developer shall amend the SWP3 whenever there is a change in design, construction, operation, or maintenance, which has a significant effect on the potential for the discharge of pollutants to the MS4 or to the waters of the United States, and which has not otherwise been addressed in the SWP3, or if the SWP3 proves to be ineffective in eliminating or significantly minimizing pollutants, or in otherwise achieving the general objective of controlling pollutants in stormwater discharges. 
(11)  Qualified personnel (provided by the developer of the construction site) shall inspect disturbed areas that have not been finally stabilized, areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation, structural control measures, and locations where vehicles enter or exit the site, at least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours of the end of the storm that is one-half inch or greater. All inspections shall be documented in writing and documentation shall be maintained by the developer for review by the authorized enforcement agency. Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of, or the potential for, pollutants entering the drainage system. Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3 shall be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. Where discharge locations or points are accessible, they shall be inspected to ascertain whether erosion control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts to receiving waters or the MS4. Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected for evidence of off-site sediment tracking. 
(12)  Based on the results of the inspections required by subsection (11) of this section, the pollution prevention measures identified in the SWP3 shall be revised as appropriate. Such modifications shall provide for timely implementation of any changes to the SWP3 within ten calendar days following the inspection. 
(13)  Upon final stabilization of the construction site, the developer shall submit written certification to the authorized enforcement agency that the site has been finally stabilized. The city may withhold the final occupancy or use permit for any premises constructed on the site until such certification of final stabilization has been filed and the authorized enforcement agency has determined, following any appropriate inspection, that final stabilization has occurred and that any required permanent structural controls have been completed.

(a)  Purpose . The purpose of this section is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to meet the following objectives: 
(1)  Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from development in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and streambank erosion 
(2)  Minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by stormwater runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water quality. 
(3)  Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows from any specific site during and following development to not exceed pre-development flows to the maximum extent practicable. 
(4)  Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, and nonpoint source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no threat to public safety. 
(b)  Applicability . This section shall apply to all subdivision or site plan applications meeting the definition of construction activity as defined in section 42-351. 
(c)  Stormwater design manual . The city may furnish additional policy, criteria, and information including specifications and standards, for the proper implementation of the requirements of this section in the form a stormwater design manual. If developed, the stormwater design manual may include a list of acceptable stormwater BMPs, including design criteria and operation and maintenance requirements for each stormwater BMP. The manual may be updated and expanded from time to time, at the discretion of the authorized enforcement agency, based on improvements in engineering, science, monitoring and local experience, without further action by the board of commissioners. 
(d)  Developer requirements . Unless specifically excluded by this section, the developer of any new development or redevelopment which meets the definition of construction activity as defined in section 42-351 shall: 
(1)  Submit a proposed stormwater management plan specifying the proposed structural and/or nonstructural BMPs to meet the objectives of this section as part of the site plan submittal. The stormwater management plan shall be prepared by a qualified person or by a professional engineer licensed in the state, if required by the authorized enforcement agency. 
(2)  Submit a proposed stormwater maintenance agreement and/or maintenance covenant which meet the requirements of subsection (f) of this section, if required by the authorized enforcement agency. 
(e)  Plan review and approval . The stormwater management plan shall be reviewed as part of the site plan review. No construction activities shall be initiated prior to approval of the stormwater management plan by the authorized enforcement agency. 
(f)  Maintenance agreement and/or maintenance covenant . Prior to the issuance of any permit that has stormwater management BMPs which require ongoing maintenance as a requirement of the permit, the developer may be required by the authorized enforcement agency to execute a maintenance agreement and/or maintenance covenant that shall be binding on all subsequent 
owners of land served by the stormwater management BMPs. The agreement and/or covenant shall provide for access to the facility at reasonable times for periodic inspection by the city or their contractor or agent, and for special assessments of property owners to ensure that the BMPs are periodically inspected and maintained in proper working condition to meet design standards and any other provisions established by this section. The agreement and/or covenant shall be recorded by the city in the land records. 
(g)  Right-of-entry . When any drainage control facility is installed on private property, or when any new connection is made between private property and the MS4 storm drain system, the property owner shall grant to the city the right to enter the property at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the purpose of inspection. This includes the right to enter a property when it has a reasonable basis to believe that a violation of this article is occurring or has occurred, and to enter when necessary for abatement of a public nuisance or correction of a violation of this article. 
(h)  Failure to maintain . If the responsible party fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the maintenance agreement and/or maintenance covenant, the city, after reasonable notice, may correct a violation by performing all necessary maintenance and/or repair work to place the facility in proper working condition. The city may assess the responsible party for the cost of the work performed as specified in section 42-370.

CHAPTER 29.06 ADMINISTRATION
29.06.010. Amendments and cost deposits:
1. The regulations imposed and the districts created under the authority of this
ordinance may be amended from time to time by ordinance, duly enacted by the City
Commission of the City of Coffeyville. No such amendment shall be adopted except
through the following procedures:
a. Amendments may be proposed: (1) by the City Commission of the
City; or (2) by the Planning Commission; or (3) upon application by,
or on behalf of, the owner of the property affected, but only in the
manner and pursuant to the procedure set forth in this section. If
such proposed amendment is not a general revision of the existing
regulations and affects specific property, the amendment may be
initiated by application of the owner of property affected. When the
City Commission proposes an amendment, it shall transmit its
proposal to the Planning Commission for a "public hearing" and
report thereon. Any such amendment, if in accordance with the land
use plan or the land use element of a comprehensive plan, shall be
presumed to be reasonable. Approval of all zoning amendments
must be by a majority of the Planning Commission members present
and voting.
19
b. When the owner of the property affected proposes an amendment to
any of the regulations imposed by this ordinance, or to any zoning
district created thereby, an application for amendment, addressed to
the City Commission, shall be filed in duplicate with the Planning
Commission.
The application shall be in such form and contain such information as
shall be prescribed from time to time by the Planning Commission,
but shall, in all instances, contain the following information:
1. The applicant's name and address;
2. The precise wording of any proposed amendment to the text of
this ordinance;
3. In the event that the proposed amendment would change the
zoning classification of any property, the following shall be
submitted:
a. the legal description and street address of the
property proposed to be reclassified;
b. the name and address of the owner(s) of the said
property;
c. the present zoning classification and existing uses of
the property proposed to be reclassified;
d. the area of the property proposed to be re-classified,
stated in square feet or acres or fractions thereof;
e. a plat, drawn to scale, accompanying the petition,
which plat shall clearly show the property proposed to
be reclassified, and its present zoning classification
and existing uses; and
f. a photograph or drawing of the proposed structure and
use, including all landscaping required under Section
29.07.
2. Cost deposits: Before any action shall be taken, as provided in this section,
the private party(s) proposing or recommending an amendment, conditional use, home
occupation, special exception, appeal for a variance, or change in zoning ordinance shall
deposit with the city clerk the following sums to secure payment of the costs of such
proceedings:
Rezonings $100.00
PUDs 100.00
Conditional Use Permits 50.00
Home Occupation Permits 50.00
Special Use Permits 50.00
Variances 50.00
20
Mobile Home Court 50.00
Temporary uses 10.00
In addition, the applicant shall be required to pay a minimum of $75 or such fee
required to enable the City to order an ownership list, certified by a registered abstractor, of
the owners and the mailing address of all property located within two hundred feet (200') of
the boundaries of the property to be affected by the proposed amendment within the City. If
a zoning classification or district boundary change is proposed to property located adjacent
to the City limits, the area of notification shall be extended to one-thousand feet (1,000') in
the unincorporated area, regardless of the radius of notification within the City. Any such
application will not be considered unless these payments are made at the time of application.
3. Disposition of amendment proposals: Upon receipt of a proposed
amendment from the governing body, or an application for an amendment from the owner of
the property affected, the Planning Commission shall hold a "public hearing" on the
proposed amendment and forward to the City Commission its findings and
recommendations with respect to the proposed amendment.
4. Public hearing: The Planning Commission shall hold a "public hearing" on
each proposed rezoning, conditional use, home occupation, special exception or variance
within sixty (60) days from the filing date. If the public hearing was to consider a change in
zoning classification or district boundaries, the following factors shall be considered by the
Planning Commission in determining its recommendation:
a. the character of the neighborhood;
b. the zoning and uses of properties nearby;
c. the suitability of the subject property for the uses to which it has been
restricted.
d. the extent to which removal of the restrictions will detrimentally
affect nearby property;
e. the length of time the subject property has remained vacant as zoned;
f. the relative gain to the public health, safety and welfare by the
destruction of the value of plaintiff's property as compared to the
hardship imposed upon the individual landowner;
g. the conformance of the requested change to the adopted or recognized
master plan being utilized by the City; and
h. a consideration of the recommendations of professional staff;
Not all factors must be given equal consideration by the Planning
Commission in reaching its decision.
5. Notice of hearing: Public notice of "public hearing" on a proposed
amendment shall be as required by K.S.A. 12-756 and K.S.A. 12-757.
21
a. At least twenty (20) days shall elapse between the date of such
publication and the date for such "public hearing."
Such "notice" shall state the date, time and place of the "public hearing," and
shall contain a statement regarding the proposed changes in regulations or
restrictions, or the zoning classification of any property, or the boundaries of
any zoning district.
Such "notice," available for public inspection, shall contain the following:
1. Zone case number;
2. Legal description;
3. Street address, or general street location of such property;
4. Its present zoning classification; and
5. The proposed zoning classification, or proposed changes in
regulations or restrictions.
b. In addition to such publication notice, written notice of such proposed
amendment shall be mailed at least 20 days before the hearing to all
owners of record of real property within the area to be altered and to
all owners of record of real property located within at least 200 feet
of the area proposed to be altered.
. When the notice has been properly addressed and deposited in the
mail, failure of a party to receive such notice shall not invalidate any
subsequent action taken by the Planning Commission or the City
Commission. Such notice is sufficient to permit the Planning
Commission to recommend amendments to zoning regulations which
affect only a portion of the land described in the notice or which give
all or any part of the land described a zoning classification of lesser
change than that set forth in the notice.
6. Rezoning for lesser change: The planning commission may recommend, and
the governing body may adopt, a change in zoning which is a lesser change than the one
requested, provided that the more restrictive district is in the same residential, commercial,
or industrial grouping as the district for which the change was requested. The adoption of a
lesser district shall only be approved with the consent of the applicant.
Least Restrictive to Most Restrictive
Residential R-4, R-3, R-2, R-1, R
Commercial C-4, C-3, C-2, C-1, C
Industrial I-2, I-1
22
In no case may a change to a residential district be approved if the application is for a
commercial or industrial district, and in no case may a commercial district be approved if
the application is for an industrial district. The governing body may refer any such
application back to the planning commission for further consideration if, in its judgment, it
deems such referral advisable and in the best interest of the public and the applicant.
7. Conduct of hearing: The hearing shall be conducted and a record of the
proceedings shall be preserved in such a manner and according to such procedures as the
Planning Commission may, from time to time, prescribe by rule. Any interested person or
party may appear and be heard at the hearing in person, by agent, or by attorney. The
Planning Commission may request a report on any proposed amendment from any
government official or agency, or any other person, firm or corporation.
8. Report by Planning Commission: Within forty (40) days after the close of a
"public hearing" on a proposed amendment, the Planning Commission shall submit a report
on the proposed amendment to the City Commission. Such report shall contain a
recommendation as to whether the proposed amendment should be adopted.
9. Adoption of amendments: If a proposed amendment is not acted upon finally
by the City Commission within sixty (60) days after the report of the Planning Commission
is submitted to it, such proposed amendment shall be deemed to have been defeated and
denied, unless the application for such amendment shall have consented to an extension of
such period of time.
Whenever a proposed amendment is defeated, either by vote of the City Commission
or by reason of the operation of this section, such amendment shall not thereafter be passed
without a further "public hearing," and notice thereof. A majority of the members of the
Planning Commission present and voting at the hearing shall be required to recommend
approval or denial of the amendment to the City Commission.
If the Planning Commission fails to make a recommendation on a rezoning request,
the Planning Commission shall be deemed to have made a recommendation of disapproval.
When the Planning Commission submits a recommendation of approval or
disapproval of such amendment and the reasons therefore, the City Commission may:
a. Adopt such recommendation by ordinance;
b. Override the Planning Commission's recommendation by a two-thirds
(2/3) majority vote of the membership of the City Commission; or
c. Return such recommendation to the Planning Commission with a
statement specifying the basis for the City Commission's failure to
approve or disapprove. If the City Commission returns the Planning
Commission's recommendation, the Planning Commission after
23
considering the same, may resubmit its original recommendation
giving the reasons therefore or submit a new and amended
recommendation. Upon the receipt of such recommendation, the City
Commission, by a simple majority thereof, may adopt or may revise
or amend and adopt such recommendation by the respective
ordinance, or it need take no further action thereon. If the Planning
Commission fails to deliver its recommendation to the City
Commission following the Planning Commission's next regular
meeting after receipt of the City Commission's report, the City
Commission shall consider such course of inaction on the part of the
Planning Commission as a re-submission of the original
recommendation and proceed accordingly. The proposed rezoning
shall become effective upon publication of the respective adopting
ordinance.
d. If such amendment affects the boundaries of any zone or district, the
respective ordinance shall describe the boundaries as amended, or if
provision is made for the fixing of the same upon an official map
which has been incorporated by reference, the amending ordinance
shall define the change or the boundary as amended, shall order the
official map to be changed to reflect such amendment, shall amend
the section of the ordinance incorporating the same and shall
reincorporate such map as amended.
10. Protest: Regardless of whether or not the Planning Commission approves or
disapproves a zoning amendment, if a protest petition against such amendment is filed in the
office of the city clerk within fourteen (14) days after the date of the conclusion of the public
hearing pursuant to the publication notice, signed by the owners of record of twenty percent
(20%) or more of any real property proposed to be rezoned or by the owners of record of
20% or more of the total area required to be notified by this act of the proposed rezoning of
a specific property, excluding streets and public ways, the ordinance adopting such
amendment shall not be passed except by at least a three-fourths (3/4) vote of all the
members of the City Commission.
11. Appeal: Within thirty (30) days of the final decision of the City, any person
aggrieved thereby may maintain an action in the Montgomery County District Court to
determine the reasonableness of such final decision.
12. Refiling of rezoning request: No application for an amendment to this
chapter including the zoning map, home occupations, conditional uses and Planned Unit
Developments, shall be accepted by the Planning Commission if an application for the same
amendment has been denied by the City Commission within the preceding ninety (90) days.
The withdrawal of an original application after it has been advertised for public hearing shall
constitute a denial of the application just as if the public hearing had commenced and been
concluded.
24
An application for a rehearing may be accepted by the Planning Commission within
ninety (90) days after a denial if it is accompanied by an affidavit setting forth facts which,
in the judgment of the Planning Commission, constitute a substantial change from the
original application.
All requests for rehearing shall be submitted to the Planning Dept. fifteen (15) days
prior to a regularly scheduled meeting of the Planning Commission and shall be included on
the agenda for that meeting as a non-public hearing item. If the Planning Commission
determines that the application constitutes a substantial change from the original application,
the item will be advertised and a public hearing will be held at their next regularly scheduled
meeting. The fee will be waived if rehearing is requested within ninety days.
14. Completion: In the event that reasonable progress toward completion of the
structure, located upon property that has been rezoned, is not made within two (2) years of
the date of approval by the City Commission, the rezoning classification is void and the
classification reverts back to the zone that was held at the time the request for rezoning was
approved.
29.06.050. Certificate of occupancy for nonconforming uses:
A "certificate of occupancy" shall be required for all non-conforming uses.
Application for a "certificate of occupancy" for nonconforming uses shall be filed with the
city engineering dept. accompanied by affidavit of proof that such nonconforming use was
lawfully commenced prior to the effective date of this ordinance.
29.06.100. Interpretation, purpose and conflict:
1. It shall be the duty of the building inspector, or any deputy or inspector
working under his direction, to enforce the provisions of this ordinance, and to refuse to
issue any permit for any building or structure or for the use of any premises which would
violate any of the provisions hereof, and to cause any building, structure, place or premises
to be inspected and examined, and to order in writing the remedying of any condition found
to exist therein or thereat, in violation of any provision of this ordinance, and a copy of such
order will be forwarded at the time of issuance with the secretary of the Planning
Commission.
2. In case any building or structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed,
altered, repaired, converted, or maintained or any building, structure, or land used in
violation of this ordinance, said building inspector is hereby authorized and directed to
institute any appropriate action or proceedings to prevent such unlawful erection,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion, maintenance, or use, restrain,
correct, or abate such violation to prevent the occupancy of said building, structure, or land,
or to prevent any illegal act, conduct or use in or about such premises.
25
3. In interpreting and applying the provisions of this ordinance, they shall be
held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of public safety, health,
convenience, comfort, propriety, general welfare and the preservation of personal and
property rights.
4. It is not intended by this ordinance to interfere with, abrogate or annul any
ordinance, rule, regulations or permit previously adopted or issued and not in conflict with
any of the provisions of this ordinance, or which shall be adopted or issued, pursuant to law,
relating to the use of building or premises.
5. It is also not intended by this ordinance to interfere with, abrogate or annul any
easements, covenants or other agreements between parties; provided, however, that where
this ordinance imposes a greater restriction upon the use of buildings or premises or requires
a larger open space than one imposed or required by such ordinance, rules, regulations or
permits, or by easements, covenants or agreements, the provisions of this ordinance shall
control.
29.06.150. Nonconforming use regulations:
1. The lawful use of buildings and premises existing at the time of the effective
date of this ordinance may be continued, although such use does not conform to the
provisions of this ordinance, and a "certificate of occupancy" has been filed in the City
engineering office.
2. In the event that a nonconforming use of any building or premises is
disconnected, or its normal operations stopped continuously for a period of six (6) months,
the use of such building or premises shall thereafter conform to the use regulations in the
district in which the same is located.
3. The only nonconforming use that can be enlarged, extended, restructured or
structurally altered shall be any accessory building which does not meet the minimum side
yard footage requirement. Before said accessory building shall be enlarged, extended,
restructured or structurally altered, an application to make any of said changes shall be filed
with the board of zoning appeals. The only notice that shall be required shall be written
notice by certified mail to the directly affected adjoining property owner. The distance
between the existing side lot lines shall not be decreased by any of the aforementioned
structural changes.
A fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) shall be paid to the city clerk to pay the costs of
such proceedings and no other fee shall be required. Said regulation shall apply only to
existing structures and shall not be construed to mean new structures.
4. When a legal nonconforming use building is damaged 50% or less of its fair
market value by fire, wind, tornado, earthquake, explosion, act of God, or the public enemy,
except flooding, it may be rebuilt provided such rebuilding does not increase the intensity of
26
use as determined by the number of dwelling units for residences, floor areas, or ground
coverage for nonresidential uses.
Rebuilding may permit expansion when such expansion complies with the
limitations as is hereinafter set forth. However, the structure shall not be rebuilt closer to the
property lines than the original structure or that of the zoning district setback lines,
whichever is closer.
Nonconforming structures damaged 50% or less of their fair market value by
flooding may be rebuilt as set forth in this section, provided such reconstruction shall
conform to all requirements of the building code of Coffeyville, Kansas, related to
construction in flood hazard areas. Any structure damaged by more than 50% of its fair
market value shall not be restored except in conformity with the district regulations of the
district in which the building is situated.
5. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this ordinance, any junkyard in
existence in any district, other than heavy industrial I-2 district, at the date of enactment of
this amendment, shall become a prohibited and unlawful use and shall be discontinued.
29.06.200. Occupancy permits:
1. Subsequent to the original effective date of this ordinance, no change in the
use of land and no change in the use of existing buildings shall be made until a "certificate
of occupancy" shall have been issued by the City Engineering Dept. A "certificate of
occupancy" for a new building or the structural alteration of an existing building shall be
applied for coincident with the application for a building permit, and shall be issued within
ten (10) days after the erection or alteration of such building or part thereof shall have been
accomplished in conformity with the ordinances of Coffeyville.
2. Pending the issuance of a regular "certificate of occupancy," a "temporary
certificate of occupancy" may be issued by the City Engineering Dept., which shall be valid
for a period of not to exceed six (6) months, during the completion of alterations or during
partial occupancy of a building, pending its completion.
Such temporary certificate shall not be construed in any way as altering the
respective rights, duties, or obligations of the owners or of the City relating to the use of
occupancy of the premises or any other matter covered by this ordinance; and such
temporary certificate shall not be issued, except under such restrictions and limitations as
will adequately insure the safety of the occupants.
3. The "certificate of occupancy" shall state that the building or proposed use of
the premises complies with all the building and health ordinances, and with the provisions of
this ordinance.
27
4. A record of all "certificates of occupancy" shall be kept on file in the City
Engineering Dept., and copies thereof shall be furnished on request to any person having a
proprietary or tenant interest in the building or premises affected.
5. A fee of five dollars ($5.00) shall be paid to the City Engineering Dept. for
the issuance of such "certificate of occupancy;" provided, however, that no fee shall be
charged for the issuance of an original "certificate of occupancy" applied for coincident with
the application for a building permit. All fees so collected shall be accounted for to the City.
6. A fee of five dollars ($5.00) shall be paid to the City Engineering Dept. for
the issuance of "certificate of occupancy" for a nonconforming use. All fees so collected
shall be accounted for to the City.
29.06.250. Validity:
Should any section, subsection, sentence, clause, or provision of this ordinance be
declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the same shall not affect the
validity of the ordinance as a whole, or any part thereof, other than the part so declared to be
invalid.
29.06.300. Variances:
The Board of Zoning Appeals shall administer the details of appeals from or other
matters referred to it regarding the application of the zoning ordinance or resolution as
hereinafter provided. The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of an appeal or
any other matter referred to it. Notice of the time, place and subject of such hearing shall be
published once in the official city newspaper at least twenty (20) days prior to the date fixed
for hearing. A copy of the notice shall be mailed to each party to the appeal.
Appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals may be taken by any person aggrieved, or
by any officer of the City, County, or any governmental agency or body affected by any
decision of the officer administering the provisions of the zoning ordinance. Such appeal
shall be taken within a reasonable time as provided by the rules of the Board, by filing a
notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof and the payment of the fee required therefor.
The officer from whom the appeal is taken, when notified by the Board or its agent,
shall transmit to the Board all the papers constituting the record upon which the action
appealed from was taken. The Board shall have power to hear and decide appeals where it
is
alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by an
administrative official in the enforcement of the zoning ordinance.
In exercising the foregoing powers, the Board, in conformity with the provisions of
K.S.A. 12-759, may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order,
requirement, decision, or determination, and to that end shall have all the powers of the
28
officer from whom the appeal is taken, may attach appropriate conditions, and may issue or
direct the issuance of a permit.
When deemed necessary by the Board of Zoning Appeals, the Board may grant
variances and exceptions from the zoning regulations on the basis and in the manner
hereinafter provided:
1. To authorize in specific cases a variance from the specific terms of the
regulations which will not be contrary to the public interest where, due to special conditions,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of the regulations, in an individual case, results in
unnecessary hardship, and provided that the spirit of the regulations shall be observed,
public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Such variance shall not
permit any use not permitted by the ordinance in such district.
A request for a variance may be granted in such case, upon a finding by the Board
that all of the following conditions have been met:
a. That the variance requested arises from such condition which is
unique to the property in question and which is not ordinarily found in
the same zone or district; and is not created by an action or actions of
the property owner or the applicant;
b. That the granting of the permit for the variance will not adversely
affect the rights of adjacent property owners or residents;
c. That the strict application of the provisions of this ordinance of which
variance is requested will constitute unnecessary hardship upon the
property owner represented in the application;
d. That the variance desired will not adversely affect the public health,
safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity or general welfare;
e. That granting the variance will not be opposed to the general spirit
and intent of the zoning regulations; and
2. To grant exceptions to the provisions of the zoning regulation in those
instances where the Board is specifically authorized to grant such exceptions and only under
the terms of the zoning regulation.
In no event shall exceptions to the provisions of the zoning ordinance be granted
where the use or exception contemplated is not specifically listed as an exception in the
zoning ordinance. Further, under no conditions shall the Board of Zoning Appeals have the
power to grant an exception when conditions of this exception, as established in the zoning
ordinance by the City Commission, are not found to be present.
29
29.06.350. Violations; penalties, actions.
1. Any violation of any regulation adopted under the authority of this act shall
be a misdemeanor and shall be punishable by a fine of not to exceed $500 or by
imprisonment for not more than six months for each offense or by both such fine and
imprisonment.
Each day's violation shall constitute a separate offense.
2. Any city or county, and any person the value or use of whose property is or
may be affected by such violation, shall have the authority to maintain suits or actions in any
court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the adopted zoning regulations and to abate
nuisances maintained in violation thereof.
3. Whenever any building or structure is proposed to be erected, constructed,
altered, converted or maintained or any building, structure or land is proposed to be used in
violation of any zoning regulation, the city or county, or in the event the violation relates to
a provision concerning flood plain zoning, the attorney general and the chief engineer of the
Division of Water Resources of the Kansas State Board of Agriculture, in addition to other
remedies, may institute injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate action or proceeding to
prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion,
maintenance or use to correct or abate such violation or to prevent the occupancy of such
building, structure or land.
4. Any person, company, corporation, institution, municipality or agency of the
state who violates any provision of any regulation relating to flood plain zoning shall be
subject to the penalties and remedies provided for herein.
29.06.500. Development rights, vesting of:
For the purpose of single-family residential developments, development rights in
such land use shall vest upon recording of a plat of such land.
If construction is not commenced on such land within five (5) years of recording a
plat, the development rights in such shall expire.
1. For all purposes other than single-family developments, the right to use land
for a particular purpose shall vest upon the issuance of all permits required for such
use by a city and construction has begun and substantial amounts of work have been
completed under a validly issued permit.
2. The Planning Commission may provide in zoning regulations for earlier
vesting of development rights. However, vesting shall occur in the same manner for
all uses of land within a land-use classification under the adopted zoning regulations.
30

enlarge joint garages, and it is not necessary to conform to the provisions governing internal
lot lines.
29.06.650. Area:
No lot shall be so reduced in area that any required open space will be smaller than
prescribed in the regulations for the district in which said lot is located.
29.06.700. Number of employees:
Whenever the number of employees is restricted in connection with any use, such
maximum number applies only to employees engaged in processing or treating materials or
products on the premises and not be employees engaged in selling, clerical, delivery, or
similar activities.
29.06.750. Protection of sewers and utility lines:
No building or addition thereto shall be erected over or across any public sewer or
utility line, nor upon any platted or recorded easement, unless permission is granted in
writing by the City, and the public utility whose lines are involved.
29.06.800. Vacated streets and alleys:
Whenever any street, alley or other public way is vacated by official action, the
zoning districts adjoining each side of such street, alley or public way shall be automatically
extended to the center of such vacated street or alley, and all areas included in such adjacent
district shall then and thenceforth be subject to all regulations of the extended districts.
29.06.850. Visibility at intersections: On a corner lot in any residential district, and on
all collector or arterial streets, except in an area bounded by 12th Street on the south, 6th
Street on the north, Willow Street on the west, and Spring Street on the east, no fence, wall,
hedge, or other structure or planting, more than three feet (3') in height measured from the
center of the street, shall be erected, placed or maintained within the triangular area formed

CHAPTER 29.07 LANDSCAPING
29.07.010. Statement of intent:
1. To provide greenery to visually soften paved areas and buildings.
2. To establish environmental conditions by providing shade, air purification,
oxygen regeneration, ground water recharge, storm water runoff retardation, and noise,
glare, and heat abatement.
3. To ensure that the local stock of native trees is replenished. Plant material
shall generally be native or hardy to this region.
4. To buffer uncomplimentary land uses and generally enhance the quality and
appearance over the entire site of the project.
29.07.030. General requirements:
All pervious land areas shall be brought to finished grade and planted in sod, native
grasses, or other appropriate ground covers. Specifically, these regulations are intended for
Highway 166/169 running east, west and south (locally known as 11th and South Walnut
Streets). In addition to the trees already located on the rights-of-way on these highways, it is
suggested that additional trees be planted depending on the design criteria for the project and
the amount of land available.
29.07.050. Minimum tree requirements for commercial districts.
1. Within the front and corner side yards where a street right-of-way occurs, a
continuous landscaped area shall be provided at a rate of one (1) medium or large tree for
every fifty (50) feet, or portion thereof, of linear street frontage, and shall be required within
the landscape setback abutting said street frontage. Said trees may be clustered or arranged
within the setback and need not be placed evenly at 50-foot intervals.
2. In addition to the required trees based upon street frontage, one medium or
large tree, shrubs, or ground cover shall also be required for every 3,000 square feet of
landscaped open space.
3. On a corner lot, no tree, shrub, hedge, or other structure, more than three feet
(3') in height measured from the center of the street, shall be erected, placed or maintained
within the triangular area formed by the intersecting street lines and a straight line joining
said street curb lines at points which are thirty feet (30') distant from the point of

the project in the same manner as parking, building materials and other details are elements
of the plan. As such, all landscaping materials shall be the maintenance responsibility of the
property owner, the developer, its successor and/or subsequent owners and their agents.
Trees placed in the right-of-way shall be the maintenance responsibility of the adjoining
property owner.
29.07.090. Tree preservation.
1. All existing trees, which are larger than four and one-half feet (4 1/2') above
ground level shall be preserved on an approved development project unless one of the
following conditions exists:
a. Any tree that poses imminent danger to the public health, welfare or
safety of the residents of the City of Coffeyville.
b. Any tree(s) located in a buildable area where a commercial structure
would be placed, and cannot be reasonably relocated on the property.
c. Any tree that cannot be relocated on or off site because of the age,
type or size.
d. Any tree that is diseased, injured, in danger of falling, too close to
existing or proposed structures, interferes with existing utility service,
or creates unsafe vision clearance.
2. When determining the location of improvements or structures within a
commercial lot(s), the developer shall make every reasonable effort to save existing
vegetation including healthy hardwood trees measured four and one-half feet (4 1/2') above
ground level and all shrubbery.

CHAPTER 29.09 SPECIAL USES
29.09.010. Conditional uses:
Any person applying for a conditional use permit shall make an application for such
permit in the Engineering Dept.; notice of conditional use permit request shall be published
twenty (20) days prior to the next regular Planning Commission meeting; a written notice
containing the same information as the published notice shall be mailed to all owners of
property within two hundred (200) feet thereof. (See permit regulations in Section 29.06.)
Upon receiving the application for conditional use permit, the Planning Commission shall
hold a "public hearing" within sixty (60) days from the filing date.
The following factors shall be considered by the Planning Commission in
determining its decision:
1. The proposed conditional use is permitted in the zoning district in which it is
proposed.
2. The proposed conditional use complies with all applicable provisions of these
regulations, including intensity of use regulations, yard regulations, and use
limitations.
3. The proposed conditional use will not cause substantial injury to the value of
other property in the neighborhood in which it is to be located.
4. The location and size of the conditional use, the nature and intensity of the
operation involved in or conducted in connection with it, and the location of the site with
respect to streets giving access to it are such that the conditional use will not dominate the
immediate use of the neighboring property in accordance with the applicable zoning district
regulations.
In determining whether the conditional use will so dominate the immediate
neighborhood, consideration shall be given to:
a. The location, nature and height of buildings, structures, walls and
fences on the site.
b. The nature and extent of landscaping and screening on the site.
5. Off-street parking and loading areas will be provided in accordance with the
standards set forth in these regulations. (Section 29.08.)
6. Adequate utility, drainage, and other such necessary facilities have been or
will be provided.
40
7. Adequate access roads or entrance and exit drives will be provided and shall
be so designed to prevent traffic hazards and to minimize traffic congestion in public streets
and alleys.
8. In consideration of requests for any conditional use permits, the Planning
Commission shall recommend such conditions of use as it deems necessary to protect the
best interests of the City, and the surrounding property and to achieve the objectives of this
Ordinance.
A violation of a requirement, condition, or safeguard shall be considered a violation
of this Ordinance and grounds for the Zoning Administrator to terminate and cancel such
conditional use permit.
9. The Planning Commission may place a time limitation on the conditional use
requested. Said conditional use permit shall be renewable at the discretion of the Planning
Commission.
Approval of conditional use permits be made by a majority of the Planning
Commission. Decisions upon the conditional use request shall appear in the Planning
Commission minutes. No further approval shall be required.
Within 30 days of the final decision of the Planning Commission, any person
aggrieved thereby may maintain an action in the district court of the county to determine the
reasonableness of such decision.
29.09.020 Primary Structure Communication Tower
a. PURPOSE: The purpose of these regulations is to establish reasonable
restrictions for the siting and screening of communication towers and their
related equipment in order to accommodate the growth of wireless
communication systems while protecting the public against any adverse
impacts on the communitys aesthetic resources and the public welfare. Also,
to balance the growth of wireless communications systems while protecting
the public health, safety and welfare, these regulations establish minimum
standards for construction and facility siting to minimize visual effects of
towers through careful design, siting, lighting and screening, avoid potential
damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through engineering and
appropriate siting of tower structures, encourage the joint use of any new
communication tower to reduce the number of such towers needed in the
future, and require the removal of abandoned towers.
b. REGULATIONS: Each application for a Conditional Use Permit for a
communication antenna or communication tower and where the location of
the proposed communication antenna or communication tower is within the
incorporated boundaries of the City, shall be accompanied by a development
41
plan in sufficient detail to evaluate its conformance with applicable standards
and guidelines.
1. Site Development Plan requirements:
A. A site plan or plans drawn to a scale of 1 = 30.00 or larger
and identifying the site boundary, tower location, guy wire
anchors, existing and proposed structures, existing
vegetation and proposed landscaping, and use, structures,
and land use designations on the site and abutting parcels.
B. Location of access roads, fencing and type, parking area.
C. Proposed lighting and exterior lighting specifications.
D. Land elevation contours.
E. Details of any proposed building, its elevations and
proposed use of the building.
2. The applicant shall provide written authorization from the property
owner of the proposed tower site, unless the site is owned by the
applicant.
3. A report, bearing the engineers seal, shall accompany the sealed
plans from a registered engineer, which describes the towers design
standards and structural capacity, including the number and type of
antennas it can accommodate.
4. A report shall accompany the plan, which compares all potential host
sites within an approximate ½ mile radius of the subject site. The
report shall include a description of the surrounding sites, a discussion
of the ability or inability of the site to host a communication facility
and the reasons why the site was excluded from consideration. The
applicant shall demonstrate to the Planning and Zoning Commissions
satisfaction that the alternative site or tower is not available or
suitable due to one or more of the following reasons:
A. Unwillingness of the owner to entertain a communications
facility proposal.
B. Topographic limitations of the site.
C. Adjacent impediments that would obstruct adequate
communication tower transmission.
42
D. Physical site constraints that would preclude the
construction of a communication tower.
E. Technical limitation of the system.
F. The planned equipment would exceed the structural capacity
of existing and approved towers and facilities, considering
existing and planned use for those facilities.
G. The planned equipment would cause frequency interference
with other existing or planned equipment, which cannot be
reasonably prevented.
H. Existing or approved towers or facilities do not have space
on which proposed equipment can be placed so it can
function effectively and reasonably.
I. The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting
factors that render the use of existing towers and structures
unsuitable.
5. A map identifying the service area of the proposed tower shall be
made available to the Planning and Zoning Commission.
6. A signed statement from the applicant indicating their intention to
share space on the tower with other providers subject to reasonable
acceptable terms and the number of providers that the communication
tower can support.
c. STANDARDS: The following standards of development shall be maintained for
the approval of the application for a Special Use Permit.
1. Tower Design: All communication towers shall be designed and
engineered by a registered professional engineer and conform to the
design standards of the Electronic Industry Associations EIA/TIA-
222-E, as amended, or other standard approved by the Commission.
2. Setbacks: Towers and accessory buildings shall meet the yard
requirements of the zoning district in which they are located. S
3. Separation Requirements: All communication towers, except those
designed as an architecturally compatible elements in terms of the
material, design and height to the existing or proposed use of the
property, shall comply with the following separation requirements:
43
All towers shall have a 1,500 separation
In support of a deviation request from the separation requirements, the
applicant shall submit a technical study acceptable to the City, which
confirms that there are not other suitable sites available within the
separation requirements. The Planning and Zoning Commission may
also recommend to the City Commission that a deviation be granted
to allow two or more communication towers within a 200 radius be
clustered for the purpose of lessening the overall visual impacts of
such towers on the community.
4. Accessory uses: Accessory uses shall include only those buildings
and facilities necessary for transmission functions and satellite ground
stations associated with them, but shall not include broadcast studios,
offices, vehicle storage area, nor similar uses not necessary for the
transmission functions.
5. Fencing and Screening: Security fences must be constructed around
or upon parcels containing towers and similar structures. The base of
the tower shall be screened from view with a solid screening fence a
minimum of 6 in height above the ground if requested by adjacent
property owners, not withstanding right-of-ways. The materials
proposed for the screen shall be specified in the development plan,
and subject to the review of the Planning and Zoning Commission and
the City Commission. The Planning and Zoning Commission and/or
City Commission may waive the required screening where the design
of the accessory facilities provides the necessary screening from view.
6. Security: All towers must be secured to protect against trespass or
unauthorized use of the tower or accessory structures. The security
may be the same as the visual screening and fence if it meets the
criteria set forth in paragraph c 5. above.
7. Lighting : Communication towers shall not be lighted except to
insure public safety as required by the Federal Aviation
Administration. Towers shall be designed and sited so as to avoid,
wherever possible, application of FAA lighting, signage and painting
requirements. Advertising signage will be prohibited on structure.
Security lighting around the base of a tower may be provided such
that the lighting is shielded so that no light is directed towards
adjacent properties or rights-of-way.
d. MAINTENANCE: All towers, telecommunications facilities and similar
structures shall at all times be kept and maintained in good condition, order
44
and repair so as not to menace or endanger the public health or safety.
Permittees shall install and maintain towers, telecommunications facilities,
wire, cables, fixtures and other equipment in compliance with the
requirements of the adopted electrical code of the City of Coffeyville, as
appropriate. The property will be maintained within the requirements of
other sections of the code.
The permittee shall certify in writing that its tower is structurally sound and
conforms to the requirements of the applicable state law and all other
construction standards set forth by the local, state and federal law every three
years after the initial permit period by filing, by January 1, of each three year
period a sworn statement to that effect.
e. DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS: All proposed communications towers of
150 or less in height, not including a lightning rod, shall be designed to
accommodate at least one additional wireless telecommunications or similar
platform. All proposed communication towers in excess of 150 shall be
designed to accommodate at least two additional antennas for each additional
150 of height. The above requirements may be modified by the Planning
and Zoning Commission in order to provide the maximum number of
compatible users within the radio frequency emission levels.
f. ABANDONMENT OF TOWER: Any antenna or tower that has not operated
for a period of 12 continuous months or which was operated under a Special
Use Permit which has been revoked as provided in this ordinance, shall be
considered abandoned, and the owner of such antenna or tower shall remove
same within 90 calendar days of a receipt of notice from the Planning and
Zoning Commission notifying the owner of such required abandonment. If
such antenna or tower is not removed within said 90 calendar days, the City
Commission may cause the removal of such antenna or tower at the owners
expense. If multiple users of a single tower, then this provision shall not
become effective until all users have ceased using the tower for a period of
12 continuous months.
g. REVOCATION OF PERMIT: The City Commission may at any time revoke
a permit for failure to comply with the provisions of these regulations.
1. The City Commission shall provide permittee with written notice of a
cause for revocation and the intent to revoke and shall allow permittee
60 calendar days subsequent to receipt of the notice in which to
correct the violation or to provide adequate assurance of performance
in compliance. The City Commission shall provide permittee with
written findings of fact, which are the basis of the revocation, with the
notice required herein.
45
2. The City Commission shall provide the permittee with the right to a
public hearing before the City Commission at the written request of
the permittee. The request must be made within 60 calendar days
following permittees receipt of the notice specified above, which
public hearing shall follow the 60-calendar days notice. All interested
parties shall be allowed an opportunity to be heard at the public
hearing and present evidence.
3. Within 30 calendar days after the public hearing date, the City
Commission shall issue a written order setting forth its findings of
fact and conclusions of law forming the basis for its decision.
4. Upon written determination by the City Commission to revoke a
permit, the permittee may appeal the decision to a court of competent
jurisdiction.
5. Upon permittees failure to correct a violation, the City Commission
may issue an order to disconnect utilities to said tower to any utility
company providing same. Said order shall not be issued prior to 30
calendar days from the date of the City Commissions written
determination. Said order shall be served upon the chief executive
officer thereof, together with the permittee at the last known address,
and have attached to it the findings of the City Commission.
h. PERMIT HOLDER CHANGES: A tower permit may not be sold,
transferred, leased nor assigned by any other person without the prior
notification of the City Commission.
i. CONSIDERATION OF CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT: In lieu of the
factors for consideration of a Conditional Use Permit application under
Section 29.09.010 of these regulations, the Planning and Zoning Commission

substantiated by substantial competent evidence or rather generalized
concerns or unsubstantiated claims are made to the Planning and
Zoning Commission and/or City Commission.
5. Whether an F.C.C. license has been granted to the applicant
authorizing provision of wireless services to the community and
whether radio frequency emissions will comply with F.C.C.
regulations.
6. Whether there is an existing tower upon which the applicant can colocate
and if so, what substantiated efforts have been made by
applicant for co-location and upon what basis were any such towers
deemed unacceptable by the applicant.
7. Will the tower adversely impact adjoining property values, present a
hazard to air space, negatively impact the environment, traffic or in
any other manner create negative impacts upon the neighborhood or
community.
8. The recommendation of professional planning staff.
9. The expert testimony presented on behalf of and in opposition to the
application.

29.09.150. Planned unit development:
1. Purpose: It is the intent of this ordinance to provide for a greater flexibility in
the design of buildings, yards, courts and circulation that would not otherwise be possible
through the strict application of district regulations, and to produce:
a. A maximum choice in the types of environment and living units
available to the public.
b. Open space and recreation areas.
c. A pattern of development which preserves trees, outstanding natural
topography, and geologic features, and prevents soil erosion.
d. A creative approach to the use of land and related physical
development.
e. An efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and
streets.
f. An environment of stable character in harmony with surrounding
development.
g. A more desirable environment than would be possible through strict
application of other sections of this ordinance.
50
2. A residential PUD shall function as an overlay district which acts in
conjunction with the underlying zoning district. As such, the residential PUD may be
established in any residential district and will not require a zoning change.
3. In general, the height and bulk of buildings, the amount of open space, light
and air, the concentration of population and parking requirements will be equivalent to those
in the corresponding districts R to R-4 inclusive. The uses permitted shall also be the same
as in the equivalent districts R to R-4 inclusive.
4. Variations and departures from normal practice may, however, be permitted
provided that the governing body finds that in respect to the intended use of the PUD, such
modifications shall create an environment for living that is equal or superior to the
development obtainable under existing zoning regulations. For example:
a. Each residential structure need not face on a public street. Residential
structures may be located closer to lot lines than otherwise permitted
provided such buildings are architecturally suitable for such
relationship to adjoining buildings or property, due consideration
being given to future development of adjoining property under
separate ownership.
5. Any building or portion thereof may be owned in condominium under K.S.A.
58-3101, et. seq.
6. Design standards and conditions for residential PUDs:
a. Location: A residential PUD shall be permitted as an overlay district
to any residential district and shall not require a zoning change.
7. The PUD shall be designated as follows:
PUD Corresponding District
R/PUD R Single Family
R-1/PUD R-1 Single Family
R-2/PUD R-2 Two Family
R-4/PUD R-4 Multi Family
a. Design characteristics: The design of the residential PUD may
provide for modifications of interior yard setbacks provided that the
plan provides adequate space between buildings for access by
emergency vehicles. Yard setbacks on the outside perimeter of the
PUD may be reduced. However, said perimeter setback requirements
shall not be detrimental to adjacent property.
51
b. Minimum size: The minimum size of site upon which a PUD may be
situated is intended to be two (2) acres. However, the City
Commission may vary said minimum area where such an alteration
would not have a negative impact on adjacent property.
c. Type of permitted dwelling units: The type of dwelling units
permitted within the residential PUD shall remain the same as would
be permitted if the area were to be developed conventionally.
However, the dwelling units so permitted may be clustered and
located irrespective of yard setback requirements or lot lines in order
to create a smaller network of streets and utility lines and to create
additional open space for the enjoyment of the residents provided
necessary setbacks be maintained to allow emergency access in case
of fire or natural disaster.
d. Number of permitted dwelling units: The maximum number of
permitted dwelling units within a residential PUD shall be computed
as follows:
Residential area of the
Permitted dwelling units = PUD divided by
Minimum lot area per dwelling
unit permitted in the
applicable use district
The residential area for the purposes of the above described
computation shall be the gross area of he PUD less the lot area or
areas designated for any use other than dwellings, quasi-dwellings,
residential open space and recreation areas.
e. Minimum lot area: The average lot area per dwelling unit shall not
be less than the least restrictive minimum lot area per dwelling unit
permitted in the applicable zoning district.
52
PUD DISTRICT
Dwelling unit type R/PUD R-1/PUD R-2/PUD R-4/PUD
Single Family *10,000 s.f. *7,000 s.f.
Two Family *5,500 s.f.
Multi Family *5,500 s.f.
*denotes the average lot area required per dwelling unit
f. Off-street parking: The off-street parking requirements, as required
by the applicable zoning ordinances, may be complied with by
providing one or more permanent, common, off-street parking
facilities for all uses within the development, provided that the
parking facility contains the requisite number of spaces for each use
as required by applicable zoning ordinances.
The total spaces provided shall not be less than the sum of the
individual requirements and the spaces required for each use, and
shall be under the ownership of permanent control of the owners for
the use for which the spaces are required.
g. Permitted uses: The uses permitted by right in a residential PUD shall
be only those designated in the corresponding districts listed above as
set out in Section 29.010.
h. Height limitations: The height limitations for structures in residential
PUDs are intended to be the same as those for corresponding
residential districts.
However, the governing body may vary said maximum building
height where such an alteration would permit a more harmonious
relationship to adjacent property and where the public health, safety
and welfare will be preserved.
i. Common open space: Open space resulting from the application of
the residential PUD standards for density or intensity of land use shall
be set aside for the use and benefit of the residents in such
development. The appropriateness of the layout and configuration of
open space shall be determined by the Planning Commission in
respect to the intended use of the PUD.
Such open space shall be owned and maintained in common by the
residents through a homeowner's association. The residential PUD
shall include such provisions for the ownership and maintenance of
53
the common open space as are reasonably necessary to insure its
continuity, care, conservation and maintenance, and to insure that
remedial measures will be available to the City if the common open
space is permitted to deteriorate, or is not maintained in a condition
consistent with the best interests of the PUD or of the entire
community. Such remedial measures shall include provisions for
right of access over private streets, if necessary.
j. Staged development: The residential PUD may be developed in
stages. In such case, the owner of the PUD shall designate divisible
geographic sections of the entire parcel to be developed as a unit, and
shall specify the intended sequence and time schedule of development
for each unit.
Each stage of development shall be a balanced unit of development
and shall not provide a higher density or less open space as permitted
in the PUD standards. However, it is recognized that in some
instances it may be desirable to begin development with those
portions of the overall PUD area which is devoted to more intensive
use, leaving the undeveloped stages of the PUD in depleted density
and open space.
In such cases the governing body may permit the development of an
initial stage containing a density in excess of that allowable within the
whole PUD unit provided that such departure is in the best interest of
the residents of the PUD and the City. In such case, the developer
shall be required to execute a deed running in favor of the City
granting it the following rights:
1. The right, in the event that development of the PUD is
abandoned prior to completion, to locate the required amount
of open space upon the balance of the PUD site for the
exclusive benefit of the residents of the developed portion of
the sites - such location to be established only after a public
hearing given to all interested parties;
2. The right, after such hearing and decision upon the proper
location, to require that the developer deed the open space
over to the established PUD homes association.
k. Landscaping and screening requirements: The governing body may
require additional landscaping and/or screening where it is necessary
to protect the property values of the immediate neighborhood or its
environs. Such additional requirements may be contained in the
54
conditions in each ordinance authorizing the establishment of the
particular residential PUD.
l. Financial guarantees: The developer may be required to furnish such
performance bonds, escrow deposit, or other financial guarantees as
may be reasonably required to assure performance in accordance with
the development plan and to protect the public interest in the event of
abandonment of said plan before completion.
8. PUD pre-application procedure: Before any application for a PUD is made
under this ordinance, the owner or his agent and the owner's engineer or architect, shall
confer with City staff to determine the applicable ordinances and regulations and to
familiarize themselves with procedures required by the City of Coffeyville.
9. PUD Application: An application for a PUD overlay may be submitted for
any residential zoning district and shall not require a zoning change.
A preliminary plan shall include the entire PUD project. Application of the
preliminary plan/plat approval shall be made on forms obtained from the office of the city
engineer. Said application shall be completed in its entirety and filed together with a

interest in said petition. However, further appeal to such
decisions by the body may be presented to the District Court
of Montgomery County, as provided in paragraph 22 below.
22. Any person or persons jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision of the
governing body may present to the District Court of Montgomery County, Kansas, a petition
duly verified.
Said petition shall set forth that such decision is illegal, in whole or in part, and
specify the ground of its illegality. Such petition shall be presented to the Court within
thirty (30) days after the filing of the decision by the governing body.
29.09.200. Residential design manufactured home:
1. On and after January 1, 1992, residential-design manufactured homes, as
defined in these regulations, shall be permitted wherever one-family dwellings are

next regular Planning Commission meeting; a written notice containing the same
information as the published notice shall be mailed to all owners of property within two
hundred (200) feet thereof. (See permit regulations in Section 29.06.)
The following factors shall be considered by the Planning Commission in
determining its decision:
1. Whether the proposed use will destroy the aesthetics of the surrounding
development (to protect the character of the surrounding development.)
2. Whether the proposed use will result in increasing the amount of vehicular
traffic to the point where it exceeds the capacity of the street network to accommodate it.

29.011 FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
29.011.010. Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact and Purposes
1. Statutory authorization: The legislature of the State of Kansas has in K.S.A.
12-707 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt zoning regulations
designed to protect the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore, the City Commission
of Coffeyville, Kansas, ordains as follows:
2. Flood losses resulting from periodic inundation: The flood hazard areas of
Coffeyville, Kansas, are subject to inundation which results in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of
which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
3. General causes of these flood losses: These flood losses are caused by (a) the
cumulative effect of obstructions in floodways causing increases in flood heights and
velocities; and (b) the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to others, which are inadequately elevated or otherwise unprotected from flood
damages.
4. Methods used to analyze flood hazards: This ordinance uses a reasonable
method of analyzing flood hazards which consists of a series of interrelated steps.
a. Selection of regulatory flood which is based upon engineering
calculations which permit a consideration of such flood factors as its
expected frequency of occurrence, the area inundated, and the depth
of inundation. The regulatory flood selected for this ordinance is
representative of large floods which are reasonably characteristic of
what can be expected to occur on the particular streams subject to this
ordinance. It is in the general order of a flood which could be
expected to have a one percent (1%) chance of occurrence in any one
year, as delineated on the Federal Insurance Administration's Flood
Insurance Study, and illustrative materials dated January 1975 as
amended, and any future revisions thereto.
b. Calculation of water surface profiles based on a hydraulic engineering
analysis of the capacity of the stream channel and over bank areas to
convey the regulatory flood.
c. Computation of the floodway required to convey this flood without
increasing flood heights more than one foot (1') at any point.
113
d. Delineation of floodway encroachment lines within which no
obstruction is permitted which would cause any increase in flood
height.
e. Delineation of floodway fringe, i.e. that area outside the floodway
encroachment lines but which is still subject to inundation by the
regulatory flood.
5. Statement of purpose: It is the purpose of Chapter 29.011, Floodplain
Management, to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize those
losses described in Section 29.011.010(2) by applying the provisions of this ordinance to:
a. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flooding or cause undue increases in flood
heights or velocities.
b. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities
which serve such uses, be provided with flood protection at the time
of initial construction.
c. Protect individuals from buying lands which are unsuited for intended
purposes because of flood hazard.
d. Assure that eligibility is maintained for property owners in the
community to purchase flood insurance in the National Flood
Insurance Program.
29.011.030. Definitions
Unless specifically defined below, the following words or phrases used in Chapter
29.011 shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and
to give this ordinance its most reasonable application.
1. Actuarial or risk premium rates. Those rates established by the administrator
pursuant to individual community studies and investigations which are undertaken to
provide flood insurance in accordance with Section 1307 of the Act and the accepted
actuarial principles. "Risk premium rates" include provisions for operating costs and
allowances.
2. Appeal. A request for a review of the City Engineer's interpretation of any
provision of this ordinance or a request for a variance.
3. Area of shallow flooding. A designated AO or AH Zone on a community's
FIRM with a one (1) percent or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one
114
to three (1-3) feet where a clearly defined channel is unpredictable and where velocity flow
may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
4. Area of special flood hazard. The land in the flood plain within a community
subject to one (1) percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
5. Base flood. The flood having one (1) percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
6. Development. Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading,
paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of equipment or materials.
7. Existing construction. For the purposes of determining rates, structures for
which the start of construction commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before
January 1, 1975, for FIRM's effective before that date. Existing construction may also be
referred to as existing structures.
8. Flood or flooding. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from (a) the overflow of inland or tidal waters and (b)
the unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source.
9. Flood insurance rate map (FIRM). An official map of a community on which
the Flood Insurance Study has delineated the flood hazard boundaries and the zones
establishing insurance rates applicable to the community.
10. Flood insurance study. The official report by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles as well as the Flood Boundary
Floodway Map and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
11. Floodway or Regulatory flooding. The channel of a river or other
watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base
flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one (1) foot.
12. Floodway fringe. That area of the flood plain, outside of the floodway, that
on the average is likely to be flooded once every one hundred (100) years (i.e. that has a one
(1) percent chance of flood occurrence in any one year.)
13. Freeboard. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level
for purposes of flood plain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for the many
unknown
factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected
size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, clogged bridge openings, and the
hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed.
115
14. Highest adjacent grade. The highest natural elevation of the ground surface
prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
15. Historic structure. Any structure that is:
a. Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the Dept. of the Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the
requirements for individual listing on the National Register.
b. Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior
as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic
district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district.

Secretary of the Interior or (2) directly by the Secretary of the Interior
in states without approved programs.
16. Manufactured home: A factory built structure manufactured or constructed
under the authority generally known as the HUD Code established pursuant to 42 United
States Code, Sect. 5401, which is not constructed or equipped with a permanent hitch or
other device allowing it to be moved other than for the purpose of moving to a permanent
site, and which does not have permanently attached to its body or frame any wheels or axles.
Such units shall provide all of the accommodations necessary to be a dwelling unit and shall
be connected to all utilities in conformance with applicable regulations.
For purposes of these regulations, the term "manufactured home," when used by
itself, shall not include a "residential-design manufactured home" as defined in these
regulations. For flood plain management purposes, the term also includes park trailers,
travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than one hundred eighty
(180) consecutive days.
For insurance purposes, the term does not include park trailers, travel trailers, and
other similar vehicles.
17. Manufactured home park or subdivision. A parcel or contiguous parcels of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
116
18. New construction. For the purposes of determining insurance rates,
structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of an
initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures. For flood plain management purposes, the term means
structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a
flood plain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structure.
19. Start of construction. For other than new construction of substantial
improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L97-348) includes substantial
improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement
was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means the
first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab
or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the
stage of excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading
and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or footings, piers or foundations
or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of
the main structure.
For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that
alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed
fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
23. Substantial improvement. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of
the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This
term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual
repair work performed.
117
The term does not, however, include either:
(a) any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of
state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have been
identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum
necessary to assure safe living conditions or;
(b) any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not
preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure.
24. Variance. A grant of relief by the Board of Zoning Appeals to a person from
the requirements of this ordinance which permits construction in a manner otherwise
prohibited by this ordinance where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary
hardship. (See 29.06.300 above and 29.011.170 Variance Procedures below.)
29.011.050. General provisions
1. Lands to which ordinance applies: This ordinance shall apply to all lands
within the jurisdiction of the Planning Commission of Coffeyville, Kansas, identified on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) as numbered and unnumbered A Zones (including AE,
AO and AH zones) and within the Zoning Districts FW and FF established in Section
29.011.090 of this ordinance.
In all areas covered by this ordinance, no development shall be permitted except
upon a permit to develop granted by the City Commission or its duly designated
representative under such safeguard and restriction as the City Commission or the
designated representative may reasonably impose for the promotion and maintenance of the
general welfare, health of the inhabitants of the community and where specifically noted in
Sections 29.011.070, 29.011.090, 29.011.100 and 29.011.130.
2. The enforcement officer: The City Engineer of the community is hereby
designated as the community's duly designated enforcement officer under this ordinance.
3. Rules for interpretation of district boundaries: The boundaries of the
floodway and floodway fringe overlay districts shall be determined by scaling distances on
the official zoning map or on the Flood Insurance Rate Map or Floodway map.
Where interpretation is needed to the exact location of the boundaries of the districts
as shown on the official zoning map, as for example where there appears to be a conflict
between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, the enforcement officer shall make
the necessary interpretation. In such cases where the interpretation is contested, the Board
of Zoning Appeals will resolve the dispute. The regulatory flood elevation for the point in
question shall be the governing factor in locating the district boundary on the land.
118
The person contesting the location of the district boundary shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to present his case to the Board of Zoning Appeals and to submit his
own technical evidence, if he so desires.
4. Compliance: No development located within known flood hazard areas of
this community shall be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full
compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations.
5. Abrogation and greater restrictions: It is not intended by this ordinance to
repeal, abrogate or impair any existent easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However,
where this ordinance imposes greater restrictions, the provision of this ordinance shall
prevail. All other ordinances inconsistent with this ordinance are hereby repealed to the
extent of the inconsistency only.
6. Interpretation: In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
ordinance shall be held to be minimum requirements and shall be liberally construed in
favor of the governing body and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other
powers granted by state statutes.
7. Warning and disclaimer of liability: The degree of flood protection required
by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare occasions or
the flood height may be increased by manmade or natural causes, such as ice jams and
bridge openings restricted by debris.
This ordinance does not imply that areas outside floodway and floodway fringe
district boundaries or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or
flood damage.
This ordinance shall not create liability on the part of the City of Coffeyville or any
officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this
ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
8. Severability: If any section, clause, provision or portion of this ordinance is
adjudged unconstitutional or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of
this ordinance shall not be affected thereby.
9. Appeal: Where a request for a permit to develop is denied or a variance is
denied by the City Engineer, the applicant may apply for such permit or variance directly to
the Board of Zoning Appeals.
29.011.070. Development permit

portion of said watercourse so that flood carrying capacity is not
diminished.
e. Verify, record and maintain record of the actual elevation (in relation
to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new
or substantially improved structure.
f. Verify, record and maintain record of the actual elevation (in relation
to mean sea level) to which the new or substantially improved
structures have been floodproofed.
g. When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, the City
Engineer shall be presented certification from a registered
professional engineer or architect.
4. Application for permit: To obtain a permit, the applicant shall first file an
application in writing on a form furnished for that purpose. Every such application shall:
a. Identify and describe the work to be covered by the permit.
120
b. Describe the land on which the proposed work is to be done by lot,
block, tract and house, street address or similar description that will

29.011.130. Floodway Fringe Overlay District (including AO and AH Zones)
1. Permitted uses: Any use permitted in Section 29.011.150 shall be permitted
in the Floodway Fringe Overlay District.
No use shall be permitted in the district unless the standards of Section 29.011.100
are met.
2. Standards:
a. Require new construction or substantial improvements of residential
structures to have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one
(1) foot above the base flood elevation.
b. Require new construction or substantial improvements of nonresidential
structures to have the lowest floor, including basement,
elevated one (1) foot above the base flood elevation or, together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities, to be floodproofed so that
below such a level, the structure is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components
having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads
and effects of buoyancy.
122
A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the
standards of the subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be
provided to the official as set forth in Section 29.011.070(3)(g).
c. Require for all new construction and substantial improvements that
fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding
shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.
Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:
1. A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not
less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed
area subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all
openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade.
Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the
automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
d. Within AH Zones, adequate drainage paths around structures on
slopes shall be required in order to guide floodwaters around and
away from proposed structures.
e. Manufactured homes: All manufactured homes shall be anchored to
resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Manufactures homes
must be anchored in accordance with local building codes or FEMA
guidelines. In the event that over-the-top frame ties to ground
anchors are used, the following specific requirements (or their
equivalent) shall be met:
1. Over-the-top ties be provided at each of the four corners of the
manufactured home, with two (2) additional ties per side at
intermediate locations and manufactured homes less than fifty
(50) feet long requiring one (1) additional tie per side;
2. Frame ties be provided at each corner of the home with five
(5) additional ties per side at intermediate points and
manufactured homes less than fifty (50) feet long requiring
four (4) additional ties per side;
3. All components of the anchoring system be capable of
carrying a force of 4,800 pounds; and
123
4. Any additions to the manufactured home be similarly
anchored.
f. Require that all manufactured homes be placed within Zones A1-30,
AH and AE on the community's FIRM, be elevated on a permanent
foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at
or above the base flood elevation; and be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system in accordance with the
provisions of Section 29.011.130(2)(e).
3. Located within the areas of special flood hazards established in Section
29.011.130 area, there are areas designed as AO Zones. These areas have special flood
hazards associated with base flood depths of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined
channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate;
therefore, the following provisions apply within AO Zones.
a. All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above
the highest adjacent grade as least as high as one (1) foot above the
depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two
(2) feet if no depth number is specified.
b. All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential
structures shall:
1. Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the
highest adjacent grade at least as high as one (one) foot above
the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM
(at least two (2) feet if no depth number is specified), or
2. Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be
completely floodproofed to or above that level so that any
space below that level is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy.
Such certification shall be provided to the official as set forth
in Section 29.011.070(3)(g).
c. Adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes shall be required
in order to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.

124
1. Permitted uses: Only uses having a low flood-damage potential and not
obstructing flood flows shall be permitted within the Floodway District to the extent that
they are not prohibited by any other ordinance. All encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements and other developments must be prohibited unless
certification by a professional registered engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that
encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base
flood discharge. No use shall increase the flood levels of the regulatory flood elevation.
These uses are subject to the standards of Section 29.011.100. The following are
recommended uses for the Floodway District:
a. Agricultural uses such as general farming, pasture, nurseries and
forestry.
b. Residential uses such as lawns, gardens, parking and play areas.

c. The susceptibility of proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
d. The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
e. The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
f. The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or
erosion damage, for the proposed use.
g. the compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
h. The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and
flood plain management program for that area.
i. The safety of access to the property in times of flooding for ordinance
and emergency vehicles.
j. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
k. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets and
bridges.
5. Conditions for variances:
a. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre
or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items (b)
and (f) above have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond the one-half (1/2) acre, the technical jurisdiction required for
issuing the variance increases.
