PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Bryant, Arkansas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the original Code, as supplemented through November, 2012, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative table appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Title, Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 6.04.050 is Section .050, located in Chapter 6.04 of Title 6. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a title of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the title. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested.

A.  In the interest of the public health, safety and welfare and consistent with the city's ordinances and master plans, the city may make or cause to be made improvements, repairs, or replacements of the public facilities located on public rights-of-way. Such construction activity commonly requires adjustment or relocation of installations of public utilities. The city deems the right of public utilities to use public rights-of-way to be permissive and subordinate to the reasonable exercise of the city's police power. Thus, the cost of relocating a public utility installation should not be borne by the city. For purposes of this policy, the term "public utility" shall mean any organization performing a public service by authority of the city whether under a franchise or by a commission. 
B.  The policy of the city is to require a public utility to promptly adjust its facilities in, upon, under or above any right-of-way administered by the city and by officials, boards, commissions, and departments of the city to accommodate construction, improvements, alterations or maintenance of public facilities when directed to do so by the director of public works or other officials authorized by the city. Utilities shall make adjustments at their own expense, except as otherwise provided hereinafter, in connection with any public works project approved and/or performed by the city regardless of the source of funds for the project. 
C.  As a matter of policy the city will seek to minimize current and future installation adjustment costs for utilities by such measures as regular and systematic consultation in public works planning, advance engineering to the extent feasible, and careful consideration of public utility needs and installations in both planning and design. 
D.  The city will reimburse a public utility for the direct cost of required adjustments in an amount directly proportionate to any federal funds which the city may receive on such projects that specifically provide for a line item reimbursable allowance for utility relocation or adjustment. 
E.  The city will also reimburse a public utility for the direct costs of required adjustments when the utility can demonstrate that the utility acquired the right-of-way or otherwise occupied it prior to the dedication of the right-of-way either to the city or to any other unit of local government. Adjustment costs shall be reimbursed, when appropriate, under an agreement between the city and the utility for the particular project. Such agreement shall describe the scope of the utility's adjustment work and allocate costs. The cost allocation shall not required the city to reimburse for betterments which are only occasioned by the adjustments required. 
( Ord. No. 85-12, § 2 )

4.12.03 - Tax shall be in lieu of other charges.

( Ord. No. 51, § 5 ) 
4.12.06 - Chapter does not require or permit electric light or power wire attachments. 
    Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to require or permit any electric light or power wire attachments by the city or for the city.

( Ord. No. 51, § 6 )

( Ord. No. 51, § 7 ) 
4.12.08 - Utility relocation policy. 
A.  In the interest of the public health, safety and welfare and consistent with the city's ordinances and master plans, the city may make or cause to be made improvements, repairs, or replacements of the public facilities located on public rights-of-way. Such construction activity commonly requires adjustment or relocation of installations of public utilities. The city deems the right of public utilities to use public rights-of-way to be permissive and subordinate to the reasonable exercise of the city's police power. Thus, the cost of relocating a public utility installation should not be borne by the city. For purposes of this policy, the term "public utility" shall mean any organization performing a public service by authority of the city whether under a franchise or by a commission. 
B.  The policy of the city is to require a public utility to promptly adjust its facilities in, upon, under or above any right-of-way administered by the city and by officials, boards, commissions, and departments of the city, to accommodate construction, improvements, alterations or maintenance of public facilities when directed to do so by the director of public works or other officials authorized by the city. Utilities shall make adjustments at their own expense, except as otherwise provided hereinafter, in connection with any public works project approved and/or performed by the city regardless of the source of funds for the project. 
C.  As a matter of policy the city will seek to minimize current and future installation adjustment costs for utilities by such measures as regular and systematic consultation in public works planning, advance engineering to the extent feasible, and careful consideration of public utility needs and installations in both planning and design. 
D.  The city will reimburse a public utility for the direct cost of required adjustments when the utility can demonstrate that the utility acquired the right-of-way or otherwise occupied it prior to the dedication of the right-of-way either to the city or to any other unit of local government. 
Adjustment costs shall be reimbursed, when appropriate, under an agreement between the city and the utility for the particular project. Such agreement shall describe the scope of the utility's adjustment work and allocate costs. The cost allocation shall not required the city to reimburse for betterments which are only occasioned by the adjustments required.

The performance test shall be directed at determining the extent to which the system complies with all the technical standards set forth in section 76.605(a) of the commission's rules. 
( Ord. No. 99-13, § 9 ) 
4.16.10 - Extension of cable service. 
    A grantee which is not already serving the entire franchise area shall provide service to all portions of the franchise area reaching a minimum density of thirty (30) dwelling units per linear strand mile, as measured from the nearest coaxial cable line, within twelve (12) months after the grant of a franchise. 
    Grantee shall provide aerial or buried drop lines to new subdivisions within the franchise area at the request of the developer provided that the developer contracts and agrees with the grantee to pay the cost of the extension of the service. 
    Grantee shall extend and make cable television service available to any resident within the franchise area who requests connection at the standard connection charge if the connection to the resident would require no more than a standard one hundred and fifty (150) foot aerial drop or a seventy-five (75) foot buried drop line or extension from the nearest coaxial feeder cable. With respect to requests for connection requiring an aerial or buried drop line in excess of the maximum standard distance, grantee shall extend and make available cable television service to such residents at a connection charge not to exceed its actual costs for the distance exceeding the standard one hundred and fifty (150) feet of aerial or seventy-five (75) feet of underground cable respectively. 
    In areas with fewer than thirty (30) residential units per proposed cable bearing strand mile, grantee shall offer a cost-sharing arrangement with residents. A dwelling, unit will be counted for this purpose if its lot fronts a street. The cost-sharing arrangement shall consist of the following: 
A.  At the request of a resident desiring service, grantee shall determine the cost of the plant extension required to provide service to the potential subscriber from the closest point on the cable system where it is technically feasible. The cost of construction shall be allocated based on the following formula: 
1.  If a request for extension of service into a residential area requires the construction of cable plant which does not pass at least thirty (30) potential subscribers per proposed cable bearing strand mile, grantee and residents who agree to subscribe to cable service will each bear their proportionate share of construction costs. For example, if there are five dwelling units per proposed cable bearing strand mile, grantee's share will equal 5/30 ths or one-sixth of the construction cost. The remaining cost will be shared equally by each subscriber. 
2.  Should additional residents actually subscribe to cable television service in areas where subscribers have already paid a proportionate share under the extension cost sharing formula, subscribers who have previously paid a proportionate share under the extension formula shall be reimbursed pro rata for their contribution or a proportional share thereof. In such case, the pro rata shares shall be recalculated and each new subscriber shall pay the new pro rata share, and all subscribers who previously paid a proportionate share shall receive pro rata refunds. In the event such subscribers (or prior subscribers) have been disconnected or have moved and owe the grantee money which has not been recovered, grantee shall have the fight to first apply the refund to amounts owed the grantee and give the balance, if any to the subscriber. At such time as there are thirty (30) potential subscribers per cable bearing strand mile, the subscribers shall receive their pro rata share of construction costs. In any event, one-year after the completion of a project, subscribers who have paid a share of line extension costs are no longer eligible for refunds, and the amounts paid in construction costs will be credited to the plant account of grantee. 
3.  Where the density of residential dwelling and occupied commercial or industrial structures, adverse terrain, or other factors render extension of the system and offering of cable service impractical, technically infeasible or would create an economic hardship, the city may, upon petition of the grantee, either waive the extension of the system into such areas, or allow the extension and offer of service on special terms or, conditions which are reasonable and fair to the city, the grantee and potential subscribers in such areas. 
( Ord. No. 99-13, § 10 ) 
4.16.11 - Free basic cable service to public buildings. 
    Grantee shall provide, without charge, one service outlet activated for basic subscriber service to each police station, fire station, public school, public library and the city office. If it is necessary to extend grantee's trunk or feeder lines more than two hundred (200) feet solely to provide service to any such school or public building, the city or the building owner or occupants shall have the option of either paying grantee's direct costs for line extensions in excess of two hundred (200) feet or releasing the grantee from the obligation to provide service to such building. Furthermore, grantee shall be permitted to recover the direct cost of installing cable service, when requested to do so, in order to provide: 
A.  More than one outlet, 
B.  Inside wiring, or 
C.  A service outlet requiring more than two hundred (200) feet of drop cable to any public building. 
( Ord. No. 99-13, § 11 ) 
4.16.12 - System improvements. 
    Grantee agrees to upgrade the existing city cable television system within thirty-six (36) months from the effective date of this franchise agreement. The upgraded system will be completed so as to provide the capability of offering a minimum of eighty-three (83) channels on an analog and/or digital basis. 
( Ord. No. 99-13, § 12 ) 
4.16.13 - Insurance. 
    Within ninety (90) days following the grant of a franchise the grantee shall obtain the following insurance policies: 
    A general comprehensive liability policy indemnifying, defending and saving harmless the city, its officers, boards, commissions, agents or employees from any and all claims by any person whatsoever on account of injury to or death of a person or persons occasioned by the operations of the grantee under the franchise herein granted, or alleged to have been so caused or occurred, with a minimum liability of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00) per personal injury, death of any one person or damage to property and one million dollars ($1,000,000.00) for personal injury, death of any two or more persons in any one occurrence or damage to property. 
    All insurance policies called for herein shall be in a form satisfactory to the city and shall require thirty (30) days written notice of any cancellation to both the city and the grantee. The grantee shall, in the event of any such cancellation notice, obtain, pay all premiums for, and file with the city, written evidence of the issuance of replacement policies within thirty (30) days following receipt by the city or the grantee of any notice of cancellation. In recognition of the foregoing each party agrees to cause their respective insurance carriers to waive any rights of subrogation.

4.16.14 - Indemnification.

    Before exercising any right of redress available to it under the terms of this chapter, including determination of any penalty assessable under applicable law, the city shall follow the procedures set forth in this section. 
    The city shall notify grantee in writing, by certified mail, of any alleged violation, ("violation notice") which notice shall include a detailed description of any alleged violation and a request for cure of such violation. 
    Grantee shall have thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of such notice to respond in writing, indicating: 
A.  That grantee has cured the alleged violation, providing reasonable documentation demonstrating that the alleged violation has been cured; 
B.  That grantee has commenced or will commence actions to cure the alleged violation, but that the alleged violation cannot reasonably be cured immediately, describing the steps taken to be taken to cure the alleged violation; or 
C.  That grantee disagrees with the allegation that a violation has occurred and contests the violation notice, stating the reasons therefore. If a violation is cured by grantee within sixty (60) days of receipt of notice, then no penalty shall be imposed. 
    Upon receipt of grantee's response to the violation notice, the city may either accept grantee's proposed cure and/or explanation, or if it believes that the violation will not be cured within a reasonable period of time, the city may schedule an administrative hearing, providing grantee no less than fifteen (15) days written notice of the hearing which shall afford grantee due process including an opportunity to present evidence. 
    Within fifteen (15) days following an administrative hearing on an alleged violation, the city shall issue a written report stating its findings and the reasons therefore. The city may determine: 
A.  That the alleged violation has been corrected, or is in the process of being corrected by grantee, and that no further action is required; 
B.  That an extension of the time or other appropriate relief should be granted until the cure for the problem can be completed by grantee; 
C.  That the problem is beyond grantee's direct control and that grantee is not at fault; or, 
D.  That other appropriate action should be taken. 
    In cases involving construction codes or technical standards, if the alleged violation does not pose a substantial and immediate safety hazard, grantee shall be allowed a reasonable and sufficient time to complete any required corrections or repairs to the system to remedy any alleged noncompliance. So long as grantee is making a good faith effort to correct the alleged noncompliance, no penalties shall be assessed. A "substantial and immediate safety hazard" shall be defined as one posing an imminent likelihood of injury to persons if not repaired immediately. Grantee shall not be penalized for other minor violations of the franchise or applicable codes, so long as it demonstrates it is making good faith efforts to correct any problem or violation within a reasonable period of time of the discovery of alleged violation. 
( Ord. No. 99-13, § 15 ) 
4.16.16 - Franchise termination and continuity of service. 
    In the event of a formal denial of renewal or revocation of a franchise, which denial or revocation is upheld by final judicial adjudication of any appeal(s) which may be filed, the grantee shall be have a period of one-year from such final adjudication within which to transfer or convey the assets of the cable system to another owner. Approval of such proposed transfer or assignment shall not be unreasonably withheld by the city. 
    In the event the franchise term expires prior to formal action being taken by the city either to renew the franchise or deny renewal, the term of this franchise shall automatically be extended until such time as formal action to renew or deny renewal is taken by the city. The renewal procedures and criteria contained in section 626(c) of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, as amended, shall be followed by the city and the grantee. 
( Ord. 99-13, § 15 ) 
4.16.17 - Force majeur.

( Ord. No. 99-13, § 17 ) 
4.16.18 - Grant of additions franchise and competing service providers. 
A.  Application procedures. 
1.  An application for a new cable television franchise shall be submitted to the city in a form specified by or acceptable to the city, and in accordance with procedures and schedules established by the city. The city may request such facts and information as it deems appropriate. 
2.  Upon request, any applicant shall furnish to the city a map of suitable scale, showing all roads and public buildings, which indicates the areas to be served and the proposed dates of commencement of service for each area. The proposed service area shall be subject to approval by the city. If approved, the service area shall be incorporated into any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter. If no service area is specifically delineated in a franchise, it shall be considered to be coterminous with the boundaries of the city. 
3.  After receiving an application for a franchise, the city shall examine the legal, financial, technical and character qualifications of the applicant. The city may grant one or more non-exclusive franchises creating a fight to construct and operate a cable television system within the public ways of the city, subject to the provisions of this section. 
4.  In the event an application is filed proposing to serve a franchise area which overlaps, in whole or in part, an existing grantee's franchise area, a copy of such application shall be served upon any existing grantee by the city by registered or certified mail. Such notice shall be considered a condition precedent to consideration of the application for a franchise by the city. 
B.  Competing service providers. 
1.  Any franchise granted by the city shall be non-exclusive. However, nothing in this ordinance shall be construed to require it to grant more than one franchise if the city determines, pursuant to the procedures established in this chapter, that granting additional franchises would be detrimental to the public interest. 
2.  In the event a competing service provider commences operation of a communications facility which offers services similar to those offered by grantee, the city shall not require grantee to operate under terms or conditions otherwise required by this chapter which are either less favorable or more burdensome than those under which the competing service provider must operate. Any franchise which may be granted by the city to a competing service provider shall require the new grantee to provide cable service to the entire franchise area then served by the existing grantee. An existing grantee may, at its discretion, comply with the most favorable terms contained in any subsequent franchise granted by the city. 
3.  Since competing or overlapping franchises may have an adverse impact on the public rights-of-way, on the quality and availability of communications services to the public and may adversely affect the existing operator's ability to continue to provide the services and facilities it is presently providing under this chapter, the city may issue a franchise in an area where another grantee is operating only following a public hearing to consider the potential impact which the grant of an additional franchise may have on the community. In considering whether to grant one or more additional franchises, the city shall specifically consider, and address in a written report, the following issues: 
a.  The positive and/or negative impact of an additional franchise on the community. 
b.  The ability and willingness of the specific applicant in question to provide cable television service to the entire franchise area r which is served by the existing cable operator. The purpose of this subsection is to ensure that any competition which may occur among grantees will be on equal terms and conditions so as not to give a competitive advantage to one grantee over another. 
c.  The amount of time it will take the applicant to complete construction of the proposed system and activate service in the entire franchise area; and, whether the applicant can complete construction and activation of its system in a timely manner. 
d.  The financial capabilities of the applicant and its guaranteed commitment to make the necessary investment to erect, maintain and operate the proposed cable television system for the duration of the franchise term. In order to ensure that any prospective grantee does have the requisite current financial capabilities, the city may request equity and debt financing commitment letters, current financial statements, bonds, letters of credit or other documentation to demonstrate to the city's satisfaction that the requisite funds to construct and operate the proposed system are available. 
e.  The quality and technical reliability of the proposed system, based upon the applicant's plan of construction and the method of distribution of signals, and the applicant's technical qualifications to construct and operate such system. 
f.  The experience of the applicant in the erection, maintenance and operation of a cable television system. 
g.  The capacity of the public rights-of-way to accommodate one or more additional cable systems and the potential disruption of those public rights-of-ways and private property that may occur if one or more additional franchises are granted. 
h.  The disruption of existing cable television service and the potential that the proposed franchise would adversely affect the residents of the city. 
i.  The likelihood and ability of the applicant to continue to provide competing cable television service to subscribers within the entire franchise area for the duration of the franchise. 
j.  Such other information as the city may deem appropriate to be considered prior to granting any competing or overlapping franchise. 
C.  Permits for non-franchised entities. The city may issue a license, easement or other permit to a person other than the grantee to permit that person to traverse any portion of the grantee's franchise area within the city in order to provide service outside, but not within the city. Such license or easement, absent a grant of a franchise in accordance with this chapter, shall not authorize nor permit said person to provide cable television service of any type to any home or place of business within the city nor render any other service within the city. 
( Ord. No. 99-13, § 18 ) 
4.16.19 - Transfer of assignment of franchise. 
    A grantee may transfer or assign its franchise to another entity (the "assignee") upon thirty (30) days notice to the city. The grantee shall provide to the city a reasonable showing that the proposed assignee or transferee possesses the technical and financial qualifications to operate the cable television system properly. The proposed transferee or assignee shall provide the city with a written statement that it agrees to comply with all material terms of the franchise to be transferred. The city shall not unreasonably delay or deny the assignment or transfer of a franchise. The reasonableness of the city's actions shall be subject to judicial review by a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The proposed transfer or assignment shall be deemed approved if no action is taken by the city within sixty (60) days of the written request for transfer by the grantee. 
    The grantee may secure financing or an indebtedness by trust, mortgage, or other instrument of hypothecation of the franchise, in whole or in part, without requiring the consent of the city. Consent shall not be required to assign a franchise from one business entity to another which is operated or managed by the grantee or any affiliated entity. In addition, so long as the manager and/or general partner of the grantee remains the same, consent shall not be required to transfer the interests of any limited partner of the grantee, who has no day to day operational control of the grantee or the system. 
    Grantee may transfer or assign its franchise to an affiliated entity upon thirty (30) days notice to the city. Consent of the city shall not be required for such an assignment, provided that: 
A.  The city is provided with a reasonable showing that the proposed assignee possesses the technical and financial qualifications to operate the cable television system and, 
B.  That the assignee agrees to comply with the terms of this chapter.

4.16.20 - Compliance with state and federal law. 
    The grantee and the city shall at all times comply with all applicable state and federal laws and the applicable rules and regulations of administrative agencies. If the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or any other federal or state governmental body or agency enacts any law or regulation or exercises any paramount jurisdiction over the subject matter of this chapter or any franchise granted hereunder, the jurisdiction of the city shall cease and no longer exist to the extent such superseding jurisdiction shall preempt or preclude the exercise of like jurisdiction by the city. The city and the grantee reserve all fights they each may possess under law, unless expressly waived herein. 
( Ord. No. 99-13, § 20 ) 
4.16.21 - Notice to grantee.

The notice provided for in this section shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other notice to the grantee provided for in this chapter.

CHAPTER 7.08 - CURFEW 

7.08.01 - Finding and purpose. 
    It is the desire of the city council to take all legislative actions possible to help protect the health and welfare of the minor citizens of the city, and other minors that visit the city. It has come to the attention of the city council that criminal offenses occur during nocturnal hours that often involve minors either as perpetrators or a victims. The city council further finds and has determined that a curfew meets a very real local need and that curfew ordinances in other communities have been a factor in minimizing juvenile delinquency. A curfew in the city is particularly appropriate in view of the basic residential nature of the community and the sense of the community that there is a proper time for the cessation of outdoor activities of juveniles. That this attitude of the community is reflected in the curfew hours declared by this chapter which takes into consideration the danger hours for nocturnal crime. The city is basically a family community. Parental responsibility for the whereabouts of children is the accepted norm by a substantial majority of the community. Legal sanctions to enforce such responsibility have had demonstrated effectiveness in many communities over the years. The city council has determined that as parental control increases there is a likelihood that juvenile delinquency decreases and that there is a need for nocturnal curfew for juveniles in the city and that the establishment of a curfew applicable to juveniles will reinforce the primary authority and responsibility of parents and guardians over juveniles in their care and custody. 
( Ord. No. 96-27, § 1 ) 
7.08.02 - Definitions. 
    For the purpose of this chapter the following terms, phrases, word and their derivation shall have the meaning given herein. When not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense including the future, words, in the plural number include the singular and words in the singular number include the plural. The word "shall" is always mandatory and not merely directory. 
    Juvenile or minor is any person under the age of eighteen (18) or, in equivalence phrasing often herein employed, any person seventeen (17) years of age or less. 
    Parent is any person having custody of a juvenile: 
A.  As a natural or adoptive parent, 
B.  As a legal guardian, 
C.  As a person who stands in loco parentis, 
D.  As a person to whom legal custody has been given by order of a court of competent jurisdiction. 
    Remain means to stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily upon the streets, including the congregating of groups (or of interacting minors) totally three or more persons in which any juvenile involved would not be using the streets for ordinary or serious purposes such as mere passage or going home. To implement that thought with additional precision and precaution, numerous exceptions are expressly defined in this section so that this is not a mere prohibition of presence of juveniles. More and more exceptions become available with increasing years and advancing maturity as appropriate in the interest of reasonable regulations. 
    Street is a way or place, of whatever nature, open to the use of the public as a matter of right for purposes of vehicular travel or in the case of a sidewalk thereof for pedestrian travel. The term street includes that legal right-of-way, including but not limited to traffic lanes, the curb, the sidewalks whether paved or unpaved, and any grass plots or other grounds found within the legal right-of-way of a street. The term street applies irrespective of what is called or formally named, whether alley, avenue, court, road or otherwise. The term street shall also include shopping centers, parking lots, parks, playgrounds, public buildings, and similar areas that are open to the use of the public. 
    Time of night referred to herein is based upon the prevailing standard of time, whether Central Standard Time or Central Daylight Saving Time, generally observed at that hour by the public in the city, prima facie the time then observed in the city police departments. 
    Years of age continues from one birthday, such as the seventeenth to (but not including the day of) the next, such as the eighteenth birthday, making it clear that seventeen (17) or less years of age be treated as equivalent to the phrase "under eighteen (18) years of age".

7.08.03 - Curfew for juveniles. 
    It shall be unlawful for any person seventeen (17) or less years of age [under eighteen (18)] to be or remain in or upon the streets within the city at night during the period ending at 5:00 a.m. and beginning:

A.  When accompanied by a parent of such minor. 
B.  When accompanied by an adult, at least twenty-one (21) years of age, who is not the parent and who is authorized by a parent of such minor to take said parent's place in accompanying said minor for a designated period of time and purpose within a specified area.

It shall be no defense that a parent was indifferent to the activities of conduct or whereabouts of such juvenile. 
A.  Police procedures shall be refined in light of experience and may provide that the police officer may deliver to a parent or guardian thereof a juvenile under appropriate circumstances. 
B.  When a parent or guardian has come to take charge of the juvenile and the appropriate information has been recorded, the juvenile shall be released to the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be located or fails to take charge of the juvenile, then the juvenile shall be released in accordance with state and federal law. 
C.  In the case of a first violation by a juvenile, the police department shall by certified mail or direct service, send and/or deliver to a parent written notice of a violation will result in full enforcement of this chapter, including enforcement of parental responsibility and of applicable penalties. 
( Ord. No. 96-27, § 5 ) 
7.08.06 - Enforcement procedure. 
    If a police officer reasonably believes that a juvenile is on the streets in violation of this chapter, the officer shall notify the juvenile that he or she is in violation of this chapter and shall require the juvenile to provide his or her name, address and telephone number and how to contact his or her parent of guardian. 
    In determining the age of the juvenile and in the absence of convincing evidence, a police officer shall use his or her best judgment in determining age.

A.

Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the superintendent ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination or in the performance of any of their duties. The superintendent shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with any security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, the superintendent will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 
( Ord. No. 94-27, § 4.04 ) 
10.04.10 - Pretreatment. 
    Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all national categorical pretreatment standards within the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the superintendent for review, and shall be acceptable to the superintendent before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the superintendent under the provisions of this chapter. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the superintendent prior to the user's initiation of the changes. 
    All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be made available by the superintendent upon request. 
    Any users subject to a national categorical pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in the case of the commencement of a new discharge to the wastewater disposal system, shall submit to the superintendent a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such pretreatment standards. 
    In addition, this report shall include a record of all daily flows which during the reporting period exceeded the average daily flow reported in section 10.04.06 or 10.04.07.B. 
    In the event the city should elect to accept an industrial waste, without pretreatment, which exceeds the limits set forth in section 10.04.02.M. with regard to BOD and suspended solids; a substantial prepayment, subject to negotiation, of the city's capital investment in sewage treatment facilities shall be required. In addition, a surcharge shall be added to the normal rates for sewer service as established by ordinance in accordance with the following formula: 
IUS - V[A (BOD-250) + B (SS-250)] 
where the following definitions apply: 
IUS = industrial user surcharge 
V = volume of discharge in million gallons 
A = BOD surcharge factor in dollars per million gallons per mg/l 
B = suspended solids surcharge factor, in dollars per million gallons per mg/l 
The value of each of the factors "A" and "B" shall be determined annually as the capitalized annual cost of removal of BOD and SS at the sewage treatment plant after considering the cost of operation and maintenance, sinking fund, chemicals, power depreciation, repairs, overhead, and all other costs attributable thereto. The method of calculation shall be in accordance with federal guidelines pertaining to this subject. 
    The prepayment of capital and industrial user surcharge shall not apply to flows of twenty-five thousand (25,000) gallons per day or less with BOD and SS concentrations of two hundred fifty (250) mg/l or less. For discharges having BOD and SS concentrations greater than two hundred fifty (250) mg/l, the flow rate shall be prorated accordingly to calculate a flow equivalent to twenty-five thousand (25,000) gallons per day which shall be exempt from the capital prepayments and surcharge requirements. 
( Ord. No. 94-27, § 4.05 ) 
10.04.11 - Final compliance date reporting requirements, 
    Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or, in the case of the commencement of a new discharge to the wastewater disposal system, any user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the superintendent a report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process which are limited by pretreatment standards and requirements and the average and maximum daily flow for these process units in the user's facility which are limited by such pretreatment standards or requirements. The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not, what additional operation and maintenance and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the facility into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or requirements. This statement shall be signed by the user, and certified by a qualified professional. 
( Ord. No. 94-27, § 4.06 )

10.12.01 - Intent. 
    In compliance with state rules and regulations pertaining to public water systems, section VII.E., the city council finds it necessary for the health, safety and welfare of the people sewed by the water division of the city utilities department to adopt cross-connection control standards which establish the requirements for the design, construction and maintenance of connections to the public water supply. These standards are supplemental, but do not supersede or modify the state plumbing code and its latest revision under which the city operates. 
Cross reference- State plumbing code adopted 7-25-59 and revisions. 
( Ord. No. 97-20, § 1.1 ) 
10.12.02 - Purpose. 
    The purposes of this article are: 
A.  To provide for the protection of the public potable water supply; 
B.  To isolate at the service connection any actual or potential pollution or contamination within the consumers' premises; and 
C.  To provide a continuous, systematic and effective program of cross-connection control. 
( Ord. No. 97-20, § 1.2 ) 
10.12.03 - Definitions. 
    Backflow shall mean the flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances into the distribution pipes of a potable supply of water from any source other than its intended source. 
    Backflow preventer shall mean a device or means to prevent backflow. 
    Double check-valve-assembly means an assembly composed of two single, independently acting, approved check valves, including tightly closing shutoff valves located at each end of the assembly and suitable connection for testing the watertightness of each check valve. 
    Reduced-pressure-principle backflow prevention device means a complete assembly meeting applicable AWWA standards and the requirements of the state plumbing code consisting of a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent differential relief valve located between a minimum of two independently acting, approved check valves. These are located between two tightly closing resilient seated shutoff valves with four properly placed resilient-seated test cocks.

When a hazard or potential hazard to the public water system is found on the consumer's premises, the consumer shall be required to install an approved backflow prevention device at each public water service connection to the premises in accordance with this article's requirements. The type of device shall depend on the degree of hazard involved. 
( Ord. No. 97-20, § 1.4 ) 
10.12.05 - Protective devices.

A.  In the case of any premises where there is an auxiliary water supply, there shall be no physical connection between said auxiliary water supply and the consumer's water system, which is served by the public water supply system. Where such connections are found, disconnections shall be accomplished and the public water system shall be protected against the possibility of future connection by an approved reduced-pressure-principle backflow prevention device at the service connection. 
B.  In the case of any premises where there is water or a substance that would be objectionable but not hazardous to health, if introduced into the public water system, the public water system shall be protect by an approved double-check valve assembly. 
C.  In the case of any premises where there is any material dangerous to health which is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device. 
D.  In the case of any premises where, because of security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions, it is impossible or impractical to make a complete in-plant cross-connection survey, the public water system shall be protected by the installation of an approved reduced-pressure-principle backflow prevention device at the service connection.

( Ord. No. 2011-28 ) 
10.16.02 - General provisions. 
A.  Introduction and findings. The city council finds that uncontrolled stormwater runoff from developed land adversely affects the public health, safety and welfare because: 
1.  Impervious surfaces increase the quantity and velocity of surface runoff, which reduces percolation of water through soil and increases erosion and flooding; 
2.  Improper stormwater collection and conveyance adversely affects property and increases the incidence and severity of flooding, which can endanger property and human life; 
3.  Increased erosion leads to sedimentation in stormwater management systems, which decreases the system's capacity; and 
4.  Many future problems can be avoided if land is developed in accordance with sound stormwater runoff management practices. 
B.  Purpose. 
1.  The purpose of this chapter is to set forth the minimum requirements for construction site erosion control and stormwater management associated with both future land development and existing developed land within the city. These requirements will diminish threats to public health, safety, public and private property and natural resources of the city by establishing performance standards that will help to: 
a.  Protect life and property from dangers associated with flooding; 
b.  Protect property from damage resulting from runoff or erosion; 
c.  Ensure the annual runoff rates and volumes from post development site conditions mimic the annual runoff rates and volumes from pre-development site conditions; 
d.  Promote regional stormwater management by watershed; 
e.  Provide a single, consistent set of performance standards that apply to all developments; 
f.  Protect water quality from nutrients, pathogens, toxic matters, debris and other contaminants; 
g.  Protect water quality from nutrients, pathogens, toxic matters, debris and other contaminants; 
h.  Promote infiltration and groundwater recharge; 
i.  Provide a vegetated corridor (buffer) to protect water resources from development; 
j.  Protect functional values of natural water courses and wetlands; 
k.  Provide plant and animal habitat and support riparian ecosystems; 
l.  Minimize sedimentation to the water resources of the city; 
m.  Protect functional values of natural water courses and wetlands; 
n.  Protect property from damage resulting from runoff or erosion; 
o.  Control soil erosion and sedimentation to minimize soil deposition in streams and other receiving water bodies and storm drainage systems; 
p.  Require implementation of best management practices to minimize the discharge of chemicals and other illicit discharges and pollutants, either directly or indirectly into the streams, rivers, lakes and other bodies of water, and into the city's drainage infrastructure; and 
q.  Assure the city is and will remain in compliance with federal and state law. 
2.  The application of this chapter and the provisions expressed herein shall be the minimum stormwater management requirements and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statutes. In addition, if site characteristics indicate that complying with these minimum requirements will not provide adequate designs or protection for local property or residents, it is the designer's responsibility to exceed the minimum requirements as necessary. 
3.  Enforcement and administration of this chapter shall be the responsibility of such office(s) or officer(s) as designated by the mayor, hereinafter termed administrative authority. The administrative authority may appoint such inspectors and assistants as necessary to assist in the performance of these duties. The administrative authority shall also be responsible to address other stormwater issues as they relate to the city's compliance with its small MS4 storm water permit as issued by ADEQ to the city. 
( Ord. No. 2011-28, § 1 )

This authorization does not pertain to enforcement of the criminal statutes of the state, enforcement of which are vested in certified law enforcement officers. Further, the authority to issue citations in this ordinance does not include arrest or apprehension authority. 
E.  Penalty. The penalty for violation of this chapter shall, upon conviction in the city district court, or any other court of competent jurisdiction, be such fines and penalties as established by this chapter. 
F.  Conflict resolution and interpretation. 
1.  Interpretation. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of these regulations shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety and general welfare. 
2.  Conflict with other laws. Whenever the provision of this chapter impose more restrictive standards than are required in or under any other ordinance, the regulations herein contained shall prevail. Whenever the provisions of any other ordinance require more restrictive standards that are required herein, the requirements of such shall prevail. 
G.  Disclaimer of liability. 
1.  The performance standards and design criteria set forth herein and in the stormwater management manual establish minimum requirements which must be implemented with good engineering practice and workmanship. 
Use of the requirements contained herein shall not constitute a representation, guarantee or warranty of any kind by the city or its officers and employees of the adequacy or safety of any stormwater management structure or use of the land. Nor shall the approval of the stormwater management plan imply that the land uses that are permitted will be free from damages caused by stormwater runoff. The degree of protection required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on historical records, engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger storms may occur or stormwater runoff heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations, therefore, shall not create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee with respect to any legislative or administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
2.  Neither approval of a plan under the provisions of this chapter nor the compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law. 
H.  Amendments. For the purpose of providing for the public health, safety and general welfare, the city council may from time to time, amend the provisions of these regulations. This ordinance from which this chapter is derived may be amended in the manner as prescribed by law for its original adoption. Before the city council considers an amendment to this chapter, it must seek the advice of the administrative authority who will make a recommendation for each amendment within thirty (30) days of this request. 
I.  Pre-existing projects. Any applicant or owner of a parcel of land within the jurisdiction of the city who has constructed a required stormwater management facility or who is in the application process shall be held to the requirements in effect at the time the permit was approved.

A.  The implementation of a fair share program is a public necessity which will enhance and protect the quality of life in the city and the state; 
B.  The requirements and standards of this chapter are necessary for the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city in that the implementation of a fire share program will maximize the use of public funds for the creation of adequate water or wastewater facilities to serve the future growth of the city; 
C.  The creation of a fair share program which will authorize development by allowing an applicant to contribute a proportionate share of the cost of a water or wastewater facility will promote a strong commitment to comprehensive facilities planning, contribute to the provision of adequate public facilities for future growth and promote certainty in the development approval process and reduce the economic costs of development by providing greater regulatory certainty; 
D.  Construction of planned water or wastewater improvements may, in certain circumstances, be expedited due to the presence of the fair share program funds which will allow the city to supplement the funds currently allocated for water or wastewater improvements; 
E.  A fair share program improves public facilities and encourages private participation in the construction of necessary water or wastewater facilities thus strengthening the public planning process and encouraging sound capital improvement planning and financing; and 
F.  This chapter implements and is consistent with the city comprehensive plan and the provisions are intended to be the minimum requirements necessary to accomplish the purposes and objectives hereof; and 
G.  The city is responsible for the funding of water and wastewater capital improvement projects and for which fair share payments ultimately will be collected. In the event insufficient fair share payments are collected to fund the improvements, the city will be responsible for the shortfall.

    If the proposed development would cause the LOS standard on a water or wastewater facility to fall below the minimum accepted level as determined under the city's management system, mitigation of impact is required to improve the deficiency prior to the impacts of the proposed development. The impact may be mitigated through payment of fair share payments, in-kind payments consisting of providing an authorized improvement, or a combination of the two. 
    Any improvement in the comprehensive plan schedule of capital improvements to which fair share payments are to be allocated, and any authorized improvement, either of which, once constructed, will result in a positive impact to the water or wastewater facility impacted by the proposed development, will be deemed to provide water or wastewater facilities adequate to serve the proposed development. 
    The monetary contribution will be equal to or greater than the sum of the proposed development's fair share obligation for improving the water or wastewater facility: 
A.  At the applicant's option, he or she may opt to construct an authorized improvement if, after the application of the model to it, the authorized improvement would positively impact the water or wastewater facility. Any construction of an authorized improvement under this chapter must be first approved by the city and conform to any applicable city, county or state department of environmental quality standards and regulations. 
B.  In the even the application opts to construct an authorized improvement, and the cost of the authorized improvement, arrived at using the methodology described is less than the applicable fair share obligation, then the applicant must pay the difference to the city to satisfy its fair share obligation. 
C.  In the even the applicant opts to construct an authorized improvement, then, prior to commencing construction, the applicant, or the applicant's contractor must demonstrate financial responsibility for the completion of the improvement by submitting a payment bond and performance bond in favor of the city. 
D.  In the event the applicant constructs an authorized improvement, then at the time of dedication to city, the applicant shall be required to post a warranty bond against faulty workmanship, as is more particularly described in the city's subdivision ordinances. 
( Ord. No. 2006-40, § 9 ) 
10.32.10 - Fair share obligation. 
    The fair share obligation will be derived by applying an approved formula to all water or wastewater facilities identified within any part of the impact area for a proposed development. 
    The construction cost will be in addition to all associated improvement costs. Associated improvement costs will include rights-of-way acquisition, planning, design, engineering, permitting, environmental mitigation, utility costs and other associated physical development costs directly required and associated with the construction of the improvement as determined by the city. 
    The city shall have the sole discretion in selecting the authorized improvement, if the applicant opts to contribute a fair share payment through the in-kind construction of an authorized improvement. If there is more than one eligible authorized improvement which will positively impact the applicable water or wastewater facility as required under this chapter, then the applicant shall have the choice of which authorized improvement will be the subject of the fair share agreement.

10.32.12 - Administration. 
    Fair share payments are due at one of the following times: fair share payments for residential development are due upon the recording of the final plat. Fair share payments for commercial development are due at the time the building permit is issued by the city. 
    Authorized improvements as part of residential development involving dedications to the city must be completed upon final acceptance of the improvements and receipt of warranty bond by the commission. Authorized improvements as part of residential development not involving dedications to the city must be completed upon the recording of the final plat. Authorized improvements as part of commercial development must be completed at the time the certificate of occupancy for said development is issued by the city. 
    Payments or improvements made pursuant to the fair share methods are non-refundable. 
    If at the time of assessing a development's fair share obligation the city has annexed the area, then the development's fair share obligation will be credited against the total water or wastewater impact fee due. At the time the fair share obligation is being determined, the city shall also compute the anticipated impact fee obligation for the proposed development. If the development's fair share obligation is less than the development's anticipated total impact fee, then the applicant must pay the difference to the city to fulfill its fair share obligation. The fair share obligation is intended to mitigate the water or wastewater impacts of a proposed development at a specific location. As a result, any impact fee credit, if provided for in an impact fee ordinance, and given based upon fair share payments for a proposed development, cannot be transferred to any other location. 
    The department will update its water/wastewater modeling analyses for use in the administration of the fair share program, at a minimum, on an annual basis. 
    An applicant may submit a letter to withdraw an application for a fair share agreement at any time prior to the execution of the agreement. The application fee paid to the city will be non-refundable. 
    The following events shall constitute a material default under the terms of a fair share agreement and subject the fair share agreement to termination by the city at a duly noticed public hearing: 
A.  Failure to make a fair share payment in accord with the requirements of the fair share agreement and this chapter, which failure is not cured within ten (10) days of receipt of notice of same from the city. In the event of termination, the applicant will not be entitled to a return or refund of any payments previously made. 
B.  Failure to commence or complete an authorized improvement in accord with the requirements of the fair share agreement and this chapter. The city will terminate the fair share agreement if the default is not cured within twenty (20) days of receipt of notice from the city of the default. In the event of termination, the applicant will not be entitled to a return or refund of any fair share payments previously made which may have been part of the applicant's total fair share obligation. Delay caused by entities outside of the control of the applicant such as governmental regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over the proposed development shall not constitute a default under this subsection as long as the applicant demonstrates a good faith effort to resolve delays as expeditiously as possible. In the event of a delay caused as a result of these circumstances, an extension of time to complete the authorized improvement will be authorized by the coordinator but only so much time as is necessary to complete the authorized improvement. Delays caused by weather which is not typical or expected for the applicable time of year shall not constitute a default under this subsection and shall be administered in the same manner as delays caused by regulatory agencies, as further described above. 
C.  Failure of the applicant or its approved contractor to maintain the insurance and bond requirements required by the fair share agreement and this chapter. The city will terminate the fair share agreement if the default is not cured within fifteen (15) days of receipt of notice from the city of the default. During any time of default prior to cure, all work being performed on the authorized improvement must stop. In the event of termination, the applicant will not be entitled to a return or refund of any fair share payments previously made which may have been part of the applicant's total fair share obligation. 
D.  In the event of a termination of a fair share agreement for any reason, all development approvals in the fair share agreement for which the fair share obligation has not been satisfied and all water or wastewater capacity reservations for unbuilt units or development for all utility network links within the impact area of the proposed development, which were reserved pursuant to the management system, if any exist or are applicable, shall immediately expire and the capacity reserved thereby released. 
( Ord. No. 2006-40, § 12 ) 
10.32.13 - Special revenue fund. 
    There is hereby created a special revenue fund called the fair share fund. Fair share payments made pursuant to this chapter shall be appropriated into the fund. The fair share payments may be utilized, along with other legally available funds, for the funding of the scheduled improvements which when completed will provide water or wastewater improvements which will be adequate to serve the proposed development. The monies in the fund may be pooled and expended on other scheduled water or wastewater improvements which are located within the same sector and which, when completed, will positively impact the applicable water or wastewater facility in accord with the requirements of this chapter in order to maximize funds and expedite construction, but only upon separate approval of each project by the city council. 
    In the event a scheduled improvement is deleted, then the fair share funds collected towards its construction may be applied towards the construction of other water or wastewater improvements in the comprehensive plan located within the same sector and which when completed will provide water or wastewater improvements which will be adequate to serve the proposed development. 
( Ord. No. 2006-40, § 13 ) 
10.32.14 - Certificate of compliance. 
    The applicant must apply for a certificate of compliance for each phase of the proposed development. The application must be submitted with the required fair share payment and/or evidence of completion and the city's acceptance of the authorized improvement as provided in the fair share agreement. Within five business days of application submittal, the coordinator shall determine if the project has complied with the terms of the fair share agreement. If the project is deemed to be in compliance, a certificate of compliance shall be issued. If the project is determined to not be in compliance, the applicant shall be notified, in writing, of the deficiencies. A certificate of compliance will include, as a minimum, the following:

E.  Date of completion, date of city's acceptance, and description of the authorized improvement(s), if applicable. 
( Ord. No. 2006-40, § 14 ) 
10.32.15 - Amendments and termination. 
    A fair share agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the parties. The city council will consider an amendment or a termination of a fair share agreement at a duly noticed hearing held in accord with the same notice procedures as the consideration of an initial fair share agreement. The city shall terminate a fair share agreement when there has been a default of a material term of the agreement, which has not been cured as provided for in that section. The council, however, in its sole discretion, may grant one extension of time to cure only if it determines, by clear and convincing evidence presented at the hearing, that the applicant has shown good cause for the extension. Good cause shall mean the applicant has taken reasonable steps to commence to effect a cure and has the present ability to perform the cure within the time allotted. The extension of time shall be for the minimum necessary to cure the default, not to exceed sixty (60) days.

( Ord. No. 2012-11, § 1, 4-26-2012 ) 
11.44.05 - Dedications/land development. 
    Land development in the city frequently requires right-of-way dedications and boundary street improvements for public streets. Development within public right-of-way may include: street construction or reconstruction; street widening; street alignment and re-alignment; curb and gutter; alignment and re-alignment; standard drainage structures and piping; driveways; extension excavation for cuts or fill sections; extensive drainage structures (such as bridges or large culverts); and similar development that results in permanent construction. 
    Significant engineering design, utility and construction problems have resulted when development has occurred without associated right-of-way dedication and roadway and drainage improvements. Lack of right-of-way dedication and associated roadway and drainage improvements can result in costly relocation of utilities and costly redesign and reconstruction of roadway and drainage improvements. Lack of roadway and drainage improvements may result in inadequate access to abutting property, traffic congestion, unsafe traffic operations, and otherwise adversely affect the safety and general welfare of the city. 
    Therefore, this chapter is intended to establish requirements for boundary street improvements within rights-of way; to establish requirements for dedication of rights-of-way for boundary street improvements; and to assure proper engineering design and construction boundary street improvements in the public right-of-way.

CHAPTER 13.12 - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION 

13.12.01 - Statutory authority. 
    The legislature of the state has in Ark. Code Ann. § 14-268-101 et seq., delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the city council, does hereby ordain as follows: 
( Ord. No. 2012-15, § 1, 5-31-2012 ; Ord. No. 2013-03, § 1, 3-28-2013 ) 
Editor's note- For the purpose of clarity, and at the editor's discretion, Ord. No. 2012-15, § 1, adopted May 31, 2012 , was treated as replacing § 13.12.01 in its entirety. Former § 13.12.01 pertained to flood damage prevention program adopted by reference and was derived from Ord. No. 95-31, § 1, adopted October 23, 1995 . 
13.12.02 - Findings of fact. 
A.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has identified special flood hazard areas of the city in the current scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Saline County Arkansas and incorporated areas," dated June 19, 2012, with an effective flood insurance rate map (FIRM) dated June 19, 2012. And Letter of map revision "Case No. 12-06-0842P" effective April 22, 2013. 
B.  These special flood hazard areas are subject to periodic flooding events that result in loss of life and property, pose health and safety hazards, disrupt commerce and governmental services, and cause extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
C.  These periodic flooding events are exacerbated by the cumulative effect of floodplain developments which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the placement of inadequately elevated, inadequately floodproofed or otherwise unprotected structures or uses vulnerable to floods into special flood hazard areas. Such structures or uses are inherently hazardous to other lands because of their adverse impact on flooding events. 
( Ord. No. 2012-15, § 2, 5-31-2012 ; Ord. No. 2013-03, § 2, 3-28-2013 ) 
13.12.03 - Statement of purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, to prevent adverse impacts from any floodplain development activities, and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding events in identified special flood hazard areas. This chapter advances the stated purpose through provisions designed to: 
A.  Protect human life and health; 
B.  Protect natural floodplains against unwise development; 
C.  Eliminate adverse impacts of necessary floodplain development; 
D.  Minimize expenditure of public monies on flood control projects; 
E.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
F.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions due to flooding events; 
G.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in special flood hazard areas; 
H.  Minimize future flood blight areas to help maintain a stable tax base; and 
I.  Provide for notice to potential buyers when property is in a special flood hazard area. 
( Ord. No. 2012-15, § 3, 5-31-2012 ; Ord. No. 2013-03, § 3, 3-28-2013 )

The purposes of these regulations are described as follows: 1) to establish a system of administering requests for the siting wireless communication facilities in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996; 2) to minimize the number of new towers needed by encouraging the use of existing towers and existing public and private structures; 3) to preserve the stability of land values or properties near and adjacent to proposed wireless communication facilities; 4) to protect the public health, safety, and welfare through the use of good engineering and urban design principles. 
The provisions of these regulations do not retain to amateur radio operators licensed by the Federal Communication Commission (FCC). 
B.  Application Review Process. Permits for the use or construction of a wireless communication facility are required. Review shall be processed as follows: 
1.  A permit for the following may be processed and approved with necessary information and agreements, through administrative staff review: 
A.  An attached wireless communications facility (attached WCF) to be attached to an existing monopole, tower, or structure. 
B.  Antenna arrays to be co-located on an existing wireless communication tower. 
C.  Facilities to be located in parks or other public areas upon approval by the city council. 
D.  Property located in the airport industrial district upon approval by the district's governing body. 
2.  All other wireless communication facilities shall be reviewed through the conditional use permit process in section 19.2. All the restrictions, provisions, and application requirements of this section shall apply. 
C.  Restrictions for New Tower Construction. Any permit application for new tower construction will be considered only after the applicant has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the administrative official that: 
1.  No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area that would meet the applicant's engineering requirements through co-location. 
2.  Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
3.  Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment. 
4.  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
5.  The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower or structure, or to adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing, are unreasonable. Any such costs that exceed the cost of new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable. 
6.  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
D.  Application Requirements. All applications shall include, in addition to the other requirements for conditional use permits, when applicable, a scaled site plan, a scaled elevation view, and other supporting drawings as may be required. The applicant shall also submit calculations and other documentation showing the location and dimensions of the WCF and all associated improvements, including information concerning specifications, site conditions, antenna locations, equipment storage facilities, landscaping, parking, access, and fencing. 
E.  Development Standards. 
1.  Height. 
A.  An attached WCF shall not add more than twenty (20) feet in height to the existing building or structure to which it is attached. 
B.  WCF with support structures shall have a maximum height of two hundred (200) feet in industrial and agricultural zones, one hundred fifty (150) feet in commercial zones, and one hundred (100) feet in residential zones.

A.  Attached WCF: Antenna arrays for attached WCF are exempt from the setback provisions of the zone in which they are located. An attached WCF antenna array may extend up to thirty (30) inches horizontally beyond the edge of the attached structure so long as the antenna array does not encroach upon an adjoining parcel. 
B.  WCF with support structures shall meet the setback requirements for principal structures of the underlying zone in which they are located, except for residential zoning districts. 
C.  WCF with support structures abutting residential property on any side shall be set back from any adjoining property line a distance at least fifty (50) percent of the height of the tower measured from the base of the tower to the property line of the residential lot. 
3.  Landscaping. 
A.  Existing mature tree growth and natural landform on the site shall be preserved to the extent feasible; provided, however, that vegetation that causes interference with the antenna or inhibits access to the equipment storage may be trimmed. Any trees in excess of six inches in diameter, which are to be cut, must be indicated on the development plan. 
B.  WCF shall be designed so as to be compatible with the existing structures and surroundings to the extent feasible. Such requirements shall not interfere with normal functioning of the WCF and may include the use of compatible or neutral colors, or stealth technology.

3.  Public Hearing: The board of adjustment shall hold a public hearing on the proposed variance to allow members to comment on the application. 
4.  Finding of Fact: For the board of adjustment to approve an application for any proposed variance, a majority of the entire board must find that each of the following facts exist with respect to the application: 
A.  Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical conditions of the specific property involved, the strict letter of this Zoning Code would result in an undue hardship to the owner, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience. 
B.  The conditions causing the need for a variance are unique to the property and are not applicable, generally, to other property within the same zoning classification. 
C.  The literal interpretation of the provisions of this code would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under the terms of this Zoning Code. 
D.  The alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by this code and has not been created by the applicant or a previous owner of the property. 
E.  The granting of the variance will not harm the public welfare, other property, or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located. 
F.  The proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the congestion of the public streets, or increase the danger of fire, or endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair the property values within the neighborhood; 
G.  The proposed variance complies with the spirit and intent of restrictions imposed by this code. 
No variance may be approved that would allow a use that is not permitted or that is implicitly or expressly prohibited. The existence of a nonconforming use or structure shall not be used as grounds to justify approval of a variance. The board of adjustment may provide conditions on the approval of a variance. Violation of these conditions shall be considered a violation of this Zoning Code. 
5.  Conditions of Variances: The board of adjustment may require such conditions or restrictions upon the construction, location, and operation of a variance, as deemed necessary to secure the general objectives of this code. 
6.  Effect of Denial: No application for a variance that has been wholly or partly denied by the board of adjustment shall be resubmitted within a period of one year from date of said denial. 
7.  Lapse of Variance: 
A.  Where no building or construction is involved, approvals for the use of the property for which the variance is issued shall expire within six months if not begun.

The public notice shall give the address and location of the property, as well as a brief description of the appeal. The public hearing shall be open to comment by anyone. 
3.  At the hearing for the appeal, the applicant shall demonstrate to the board of adjustment why he/she believes the administrative official was incorrect in making his/her decision based upon the facts of the case and the provisions of the Zoning Code. Input from the public shall be allowed. The board of adjustment may uphold, partially uphold, or reverse the decision of the administrative official. The board of adjustment shall consider all the facts presented in determining whether the administrative official was correct in carrying out the provisions of the Zoning Code. 
J.  Ord. No. 2017-25 . 
1.  Section 3-Zoning Map.

A.  The regulations pertaining to each zoning district establish the character of the zoning district, and the regulations shall be applied uniformly within the zoning district. 
B.  When a use is proposed for a zoning district that is not explicitly permitted or prohibited within the zoning district, the planning commission shall determine whether said use is compatible (i.e., in character) and if it is so finds that it is, authorize said use to be established. Mixed uses or uses not covered under the established zoning districts must be submitted as a planned unit development (PUD). The planning commission shall decide each application on its merits. 
C.  No building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered unless in conformity with all of the regulations herein specified for the zoning district in which it is located. 
D.  No building or other structure shall hereafter be erected or altered that does not comply with all conditions of the zoning district. 
E.  Interpretation of District Boundaries. When uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of districts as shown on the official zoning map, the following rules shall apply: 
1.  District boundary lines in general are intended to be along or parallel to the centerline of streets, alleys, easements, other rights-of-way, and creeks, streams, or other water channels. 
2.  District boundary lines are intended to be along or parallel to property lines or the lot lines of platted additions. 
3.  In the absence of specific distances such dimensions shall be determined by the scale of the official zoning map. 
F.  Lots of Record: Any nonconforming lot that was platted before (insert adoption date) may be used for a permitted use provided that the setbacks are not reduced less than seventy-five (75) percent of the zoning requirement. No setback may be reduced to less than five feet. 
This provision shall only apply to the following nonconforming lots: 
1.  Lots that do not meet the minimum lot width or lot size requirements in its zoning district; 
2.  Lots that have been built upon such that the building setback, yards, open space, building height, or location of parking or loading spaces, do not now comply with the requirements in its zoning district. 
3.  Section 5-Residential Districts. 
Section 5.1: District Descriptions 
5.1.1: Duplex Residential District R-1

Section 15-Planned Unit Developments (PUD) 
ADD DEFINITIONS FOR: 
    Common usable open space: Open space areas within a development such as a Planned Unit Development which are designed and intended for landscaping, natural preservation, or recreational use by the residents or users of the development. Drainage structures and areas used for the aerial transmission of utilities are not considered common usable open space unless made suitable for recreational use. 
    Floor area ratio: A mathematical ratio representing the gross floor area for all structures on a lot divided by the total lot area. The gross floor area shall include the calculated floor area for each story within a structure. For example, the gross floor area of a two-story structure with a 800 square foot footprint shall be expressed as 1600 square feet. 
Section 15.1: General 
15.1.1 Existing Developments 
All properties previously developed under all previous Planned Unit Development (PUD) provisions shall be considered legal and valid, and be designated as Planned Unit Developments (PUDs) on the Official Zoning Map. Upon modifications requested by the owner/applicant, such developments shall be brought into conformance with the standards contained within this Section to the extent possible. 
15.1.2 Purpose 
The purposes of this zone are to promote flexibility and innovation in design and to encourage innovation in the design of large-scale developments and the use of vacant, in-fill parcels in the built up portion of the city. The zone also promotes the inclusion of open space in developments. 
In concept, the Planned Unit Development (PUD) is a combination of zoning designation and development plan. The approval process is designed to encourage innovation by the developer by allowing submittal of engineered plans, known as a Final Development Plan, after approval of a Zoning Plan to rezone the property. Development must follow the approved Final Development Plan exactly. Failure in this respect can result in revocation of the PUD. Although design innovation is encouraged, and flexibility is allowed, the PUD may not be used simply as a method of avoiding zoning regulations. 
Section 15.2: Minimum Size and Use Criteria 
PUD applications shall meet the following criteria before they will be considered for review and approval. 
A.  PUDs may be residential, commercial, industrial or mixed-use in nature. 
B.  The minimum size for PUDs which incorporate residential or mixed-uses shall be three (3) acres. The minimum size for PUDs which incorporate commercial or industrial uses shall be one (1) acre. 
Section 15.3: Development Standards 
15.3.1 Permitted Uses 
Permitted uses within a PUD shall conform to the permitted uses within the existing zoning district in which the PUD is being proposed, or/and shall be consistent with the general character of the land use classification of the subject property in the city's Comprehensive Plan, or/and be substantially similar to and compatible with adjacent property. 
15.3.2 Development Density 
All plans shall clearly depict the proposed density by land use category. Residential density shall be depicted in the manner described in Section 15.3.4 below. Non-residential density shall be expressed as Floor Area Ratio. 
15.3.3 Setbacks 
Building setbacks will be designed in such a manner that they create a harmonious grouping of buildings, allow maintenance of streets and utilities, do not violate any safety codes including the Arkansas Fire Prevention Code, and do not restrict the provision of emergency or public services. 
15.3.4 Lot Size and Area Requirements 
No minimum lot sizes are established. Housing and development can be clustered or otherwise concentrated or arranged in planned locations on the site to take advantage of natural features and topography. 
The following restrictions apply to developments which incorporate residential uses: 
Residential density for any development shall not exceed the following standards as measured by dwelling units per developable acre (dua). Calculation shall not include areas devoted to surface streets and surface drainage improvements. This shall be computed by the equation below: 
Housing Units / (Developable Land + Common Usable Open Space) = Residential Density 
Single-Family: 7 dua Single-Family Zero Lot Line: 7 dua Duplex: 9 dua Townhouses/Condominium: * Multi-Family (1-2 stories): * Multi-Family (3 stories or more): * * See Section 15.6.1, paragraph C  
15.3.5 Open Space Reservation 
Land not used by buildings, accessory structures, yards, streets, or drainage, shall be maintained as common usable open space for the purpose of providing parks, recreational facilities, ways for pedestrian movement and circulation, and conserving visually pleasing elements of the environment. 
A.  PUDs with exclusively residential land use shall designate at least fifteen (15) percent of the total development area to common usable open space. All other PUDs shall designate at least ten (10) percent of the total development area to common usable open space. 
B.  No more than one-half (1/2) of the common usable open space in a development may be covered by water. 
C.  No more than one-half (1/2) of the common usable space may have a slope greater than fifteen (15) percent. 
15.3.6 Common Usable Open Spaces - Future Phase Construction 
If common usable open space and common space improvements required for a development are planned for construction in future phases, a performance bond shall be required. Prior to the sale of any lot, site, home or other structure, a bond of sufficient surety determined by the Administrative Official shall be posted with the City for completion of said common usable open space improvements. The amount of the bond shall reflect 150 percent of the Administrative Official's estimate for completing the required improvements. The Zoning Plan shall clearly depict the amount of land to be used and maintained as permanent common usable open space. 
15.3.7 Sidewalk System 
The development shall be subject to the sidewalk requirements contained in this code and the Bryant Subdivision and Development Code. The Developer may optionally propose an alternative pedestrian circulation system, provided pedestrian access is given to each lot within the development. 
15.3.8 Landscaping 
All developments shall provide landscaping that at a minimum meets the spirit and intent of the landscaping regulations contained within this Code. Landscaping shall be designed to complement the site's topography and create a discernible amenity for the development. 
15.3.9 Bills of Assurance, Covenants, Home Owners Associations, Special Improvement Districts 
The developer shall create such legal entities as appropriate to undertake and be responsible for the ownership, operation, construction, and maintenance of private roads, parking areas, common usable open space, community facilities, recreation areas, buildings, lighting, security measures, and similar common elements.

E.  Homeowners must pay their pro-rata share of the initial cost, the maintenance assessment levied by the entity must be stipulated as a potential lien on the property. 
F.  The entity must able to adjust the assessment to meet changed needs. 
15.3.10 Responsibility for Open Space 
Nothing in this Code shall be construed as assigning or assuming any responsibility or liability on the part of the City of Bryant, for maintenance of any private open areas, parks, or recreational facilities. A hold harmless clause shall be incorporated in the covenants conveying with the land to this effect. It shall be provided further, however, that when an owner of a Planned Unit Development desires to dedicate certain land areas to the City for public parks and recreational facilities, and the City approves the nature and location of such lands, and accepts the dedicated areas, the City shall be responsible for the operation and maintenance of these lands and properties. 
15.3.11 Private Street Conversion

B.  Final Development Plan and Approval 
1.  Short Form: Developments contained on one-lot that are not intended for re-subdivision into additional lots. 
2.  Long Form: Developments intended to plat property into two or more lots. 
15.4.1 Zoning Plan Review and Approval 
A.  Pre-application Conference: Before submitting an application for PUD approval, the owner, authorized agent, or developer shall confer with the Design Review Committee. The intent of this conference is to provide guidance to the applicant prior to incurring substantial legal and engineering expense in the preparation of plans. An additional purpose is to ensure proper information is provided with a formal PUD application. The Design Review Committee will discuss the applicant's potential application and inform the applicant of any perceived potential problems that might arise in the development process. 
B.  The Zoning Plan shall consist of a Zoning Plan for the development without the submittal of an engineered site plan and construction plans. Approval of the Zoning Plan shall have the effect of rezoning the property. 
1.  Before an application can be considered, a complete application with the PUD application fee must be filed and paid with the Administrative Official. 
2.  The Design Review Committee shall review the application and provide comments to the applicant for revision of the plans. A public hearing for the Zoning Plan shall be set no later than sixty (60) days after filing the application. The procedures for rezonings or zoning amendments shall govern the process for arranging the public hearing. 
3.  A public hearing shall be conducted. If the applicant requests deferral of a decision on the application to allow modification, the application which is deferred shall be subject to an additional public hearing to allow public comment. If the request for deferral is made at the same meeting at which the public hearing was conducted, the Planning Commission shall allow the public hearing to be continued at the following regular meeting of the Planning Commission without being re-advertised. 
4.  Unless a deferral is requested by the applicant, the Planning Commission shall render a decision to approve, conditionally approve, or deny the application within sixty (60) days of the public hearing. 
5.  To approve a PUD Zoning Plan, the Planning Commission shall find the following: 
a.  The PUD provides public benefits that would not be achievable through the normal zoning regulations. 
b.  Adequate public utilities are already in place to service the property, or the developer has sufficient plans and private financial commitment in place to ensure adequate public utilities will be available to service the property. 
c.  The development has land use compatibility with surrounding developments. 
d.  The development is compatible with the City's Comprehensive Plan. 
e.  The development does not endanger the public health, welfare or safety. 
6.  For any application that is conditionally approved by the Planning Commission, the applicant shall have ninety (90) days to submit modified plans. These plans shall be reviewed by the Design Review Committee to determine if the modified plans comply with the Planning Commission's conditional approval. The Administrative Official shall provide a written report of his/her findings to the planning commission and city council. The city council will not consider any modified plans that are not reviewed by the Design Review Committee. 
7.  An application which is approved or conditionally approved shall be forwarded to the City Council for approval. The City Council shall render a decision to approve or deny the application by an ordinance to rezone the property. The city council may also refer the application back to the Planning Commission for reconsideration and modification without an additional public hearing. Such decision shall occur within thirty (30) days of a decision of the Planning Commission or submission of modified plans, whichever is later. 
15.4.2 Final Development Plan Review and Approval Procedure 
A.  The Final Development Plan shall be either a Short Form or Long Form. 
1.  Short Form PUD: Developments contained on one lot that are not intended for re-subdivision into additional lots. The Final Development Plan shall consist of the Zoning Plan and submittal of engineered site plan and construction plans and meeting the submission requirements of Section 15.4.3. 
2.  Long Form PUD: Developments intended to plat property into two or more lots. The first step in the process of preparing the Long Form Final Development Plan is preparation and submission of a Preliminary Plat, which conforms to the procedures and requirements of the Bryant Land Subdivision and Development Code. An application for a Final Development Plan shall not be accepted by the Administrative Official until and unless a Preliminary Plat for the property has been approved by the Planning Commission. The submission shall meet the requirements of Section 15.4.3. 
The Final Development Plan shall consist of the approved Zoning Plan and submittal of a Final Plat application. The Final Plat application shall be subject to the regulations and requirements of the Bryant Subdivision and Development Code; however, approval shall be subject to acceptance of the public dedication of streets, utilities, and other public facilities. 
Approval of the Long Form Final Development Plan shall have the effect of permitting the applicant to sell lots in the development, obtain building permits, or file an application for site plan or large scale development review. 
B.  The Design Review Committee shall review the application and provide comments to the applicant for revision of the drawings and/or plat requirements. 
C.  The Design Review Committee shall approve or deny the Final Development Plan and provide report of approval to the Planning Commission within twenty (20) business days following approval. The Design Review Committee shall not approve a Final Development Plan that contains a Zoning Plan that does not match the Zoning Plan previously approved by the City Council, excluding minor modifications, or that contains construction plans that do not address comments for revision made by the Design Review Committee. 
The applicant shall provide a written explanation for any modifications to the Zoning Plan. 
D.  The Design Review Committee shall have the authority to defer approval of a Final Development Plan to the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall have the authority to require any Final Development Plan be reviewed for approval by the Planning Commission instead of the Design Review Committee. 
E.  The applicant, any Planning Commissioner, any City Council member, or any aggrieved party may appeal the decision of the Design Review Committee rendered on a Final Development Plan by written request made to the Administrative Official within thirty (30) days of the Design Review Committee's decision.
