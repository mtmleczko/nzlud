PREFACE 
    This Code is a codification of the ordinances of the Town of Pembroke Park, Florida of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by the Town Commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 6 is numbered 6-1 and the fourth section of Chapter 7 is 7-4. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 3-1.1, 3-1.2 and 3-1.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 8 and 9, it will be designated as Chapter 8.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
    The indices of the Code have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under direct supervision of A. Lawton Langford, President, and Alyce A. Whitson, Supervising Editor and Laura Johnson, Editorial Assistant of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

    The publishers are most grateful to A. J. Ryan Jr., Town Attorney and Barbara R. Powell, Deputy Town Clerk for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the Town readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the Town's affairs.

(b)  A bidder with a "substantial interest" who has been adversely affected by the Town's selection of a bidder may protest the selection by complying with the requirements set forth herein. A bidder shall be deemed to have a "substantial interest" if the bidder would have been selected as the lowest responsive and responsible bidder but for the alleged mistake or irregularly described in the protest. If the Using Department or Finance and Budget Director determine that a bidder does not have a "substantial interest," that bidder is precluded from bringing a bid protest pursuant to this section. 
(c)  A bidder wishing to object to terms, conditions, specifications, procedures, selection criteria, weight of evaluation criteria or other matter set forth in the bid or proposed documents must make such objections in writing during the period of time set forth for questions and answers in the invitation to bid, request for proposal, request for qualifications or request for letters of interest. A bidder who has not raised such objections in writing during the question and answer time may not use the bid protect process to object to these matters once a notice of bid/proposal action has been posted. 
(d)  A bidder may file a "Notice of Intent to Protest" by emailing said notice to the Using Department or Finance and Budget Director within two business days of the issuance of the notice of bid/proposal action pursuant to subsection (a) hereof or the publication of a Town Commission agenda recommending the award of the bid, whichever is sooner.

To be considered, the written protest of bid must include: 
(1)  The bid or proposal number and title;

If the protest is upheld by the Town, the bond will be refunded to the protester. If the protest is denied, the entire bid protest bond amount shall be forfeited to the Town. 
(f)  Upon receipt of a timely filled and complete formal written bid protest, the Using Department and Finance and Budget Director shall stay the award of the purchase order or contract until the bid protest is resolved, unless the Using Department and Finance and Budget Director determine in writing that compelling circumstances exist which require that the award be processed without further delay in order to protect the Town's interest or for the purpose of avoiding an immediate and serious danger to the public health, safety or welfare of the citizens or substantial disruption of Town operations. 
(g)  After receipt of the timely filed and complete written bid protest, and upon the protester's request, the Using Department and Finance and Budget Director shall meet with the protester to discuss the allegations and to attempt to resolve the matter. The Using Department and Finance and Budget Director shall issue their decision on the bid protest within fourteen (14) calendar days of the meeting, or if no meeting is requested, within fourteen (14) days of receipt of the timely filed and complete written bid protest. Such decision shall be e-mailed to the protester on the date of issuance unless otherwise directed by the protester.

The appeal must be in writing and must include a full explanation of the basis of disagreement with the decision rendered by the Using Department and Finance and Budget Director, as well as the relief sought. The Town Commission will review the bid protest appeal and shall overturn the bid award if the protester proves that the bid award did not comply in material respects with the requirements contained in the invitation to bid, request for proposal, request for qualifications or request for letters of interest, this procurement code, or Florida law. The Town Commission's decision shall be e-mailed to the protester on the date of issuance unless another method of delivery is otherwise directed by the protester. 
(i)  Failure by a bidder to comply with the timelines and requirements set forth herein shall result in an immediate invalidation and termination of the bid protest and a waiver of the right to seek further redress or to appeal the alleged adverse action in a court of law. 
(j)  Any and all costs incurred by a protesting party in connection with a bid protest pursuant to this section shall be the sole responsibility of the protesting party.

(5)  Complete construction of forty (40) percent of its proposed system (measured in terms of total linear strand miles) within two (2) years after receiving certification from the FCC, and complete an additional twenty (20) percent each year thereafter so that after five (5) years the entire system shall be substantially constructed and the grantee capable of providing service no more than sixty (60) days after receiving an application for service to every dwelling unit within the franchise area except to the extent that density of homes, adverse terrain or other factors render making service available impracticable. For the purposes of determining compliance with the provisions of this paragraph (a)(5), and to provide for a reasonable policy requiring extension of energized trunk lines of the cable system within the franchise area so as to achieve compliance with the obligations imposed by this section, the grantee shall extend such lines to all areas of the franchise area having a minimum of fifty (50) homes per street mile; 
(6)  File a map and progress report with the agency at the close of each calendar year, showing the exact areas of the franchise entity being served by the cable television system and the location and identification of major component parts of the system. 
(b)  Failure on the part of a grantee to commence and diligently pursue each of the foregoing requirements and to complete each of the matters set forth in this section, shall be grounds for termination of its franchise pursuant to the terms of section 6-4(b) provided, however, that the franchise authority may in its discretion extend the time for the commencement and completion of construction and installation for additional periods in the event the grantee, acting in good faith, experiences delays by reasons of circumstances beyond its control. 
(c)  If the operation of any part of a cable television system is discontinued for a continuous period of twelve (12) months, or if such system has been installed in any public street without complying with the requirements of the grantee's franchise, the grantee shall promptly, upon being given ten (10) days' notice, remove from the streets or public places all such property and poles of such system. Any property which the grantee allows to remain in place sixty (60) days after having been notified by the franchise entity that it must be removed shall be considered permanently abandoned and shall become the property of the franchise entity subject to the provisions of any utility joint use attachment agreement. 
(d)  Upon the failure of a grantee to satisfactorily complete any work upon the public streets as may be required by law or the terms of its franchise within the time prescribed, the franchise entity, at its option, may cause such work to be done and the grantee shall pay to the franchise entity the cost thereof within thirty (30) days after receipt of an itemized report.

(a)  Concurrently with the acceptance of its franchise, a grantee shall file with the agency a bond with an acceptable surety in the amount of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00), or in such other amount as the franchise authority may determine, to indemnify the franchise entity against any losses it may suffer if the grantee fails to comply with one (1) or more of the provisions of its franchise. Such bond shall be obtained at the sole expense of the grantee and remain in effect for the full term of the franchise or any renewal thereof plus an additional six (6) months thereafter. The grantee and its surety shall be jointly and liable under the terms of the bond for any damages or loss suffered by the franchise entity as a result of the grantee's nonperformance, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification or cost of removal of any property of the grantee in the event of default, a reasonable allowance for attorney's fees and costs, up to the full amount of the bond. The bond shall provide for thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the franchise authority of any intention on the part of the grantee to cancel, fail to renew or otherwise materially alter its terms. 
(b)  Neither the filing of an indemnity bond with the agency, nor the receipt of any damages recovered by the franchise authority thereunder, shall be construed to excuse faithful performance by the grantee to limit the liability of the grantee under the terms of its franchise for damages, either to the full amount of the bond or otherwise. 
(Ord. No. 79-2-3, § 12, 2-13-79) 
Sec. 6-13. - Franchise payments. 
(a)  Any person awarded a franchise under this chapter shall pay to the franchise entity, each year during the life of the franchise, a franchise fee in the amount of three (3) percent of its annual gross revenues derived from its operation of the franchise cable television system within the franchise area limits. The amount of any application fee shall be a credit against the first year's franchise fee. 
(b)  A grantee shall file with the agency, within ninety (90) days after the expiration of any calendar year or portion thereof during which its franchise is in force, a financial statement certified by a reasonable officer of the grantee, showing in detail the gross revenue, as defined in this chapter, of the grantee during the preceding calendar year or portion thereof. It shall be the duty of the grantee to pay the franchise entity within fifteen (15) days after the time for filing such statement, the sum prescribed above or any unpaid balance thereof for the calendar year covered by such statements. 
(c)  The franchise entity shall have the right to inspect the grantee records showing the gross subscriber revenues from which its franchise payments are computed and shall also have the right of audit and recomputation of any and all amounts paid under this chapter. No acceptance of payment shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the franchise entity may have for further or additional sums payable under this chapter or for the performance of any other obligation under this chapter; however, an accounting rendered to the franchise entity and to which no exception is made within three (3) years after receipt by the franchise entity shall be deemed to be accurate and shall not thereafter be subject to question or made the basis of any claim by the franchise entity against the grantee.

Sec. 6-14. - Rates charged to subscriber.

(b)  Any rate established shall be reasonable, just and fair to the public and shall provide the grantee a return upon its investment reasonably sufficient to: 
(1)  Assure confidence in the grantee's financial soundness; 
(2)  Support its credit and attract necessary capital under efficient and economical management; 
(3)  Provide a return to equity owners commensurate with current returns on investment in other enterprises having corresponding risks. 
(c)  No rate established shall afford any undue preference or advantage among subscribers, but separate rates may be established for separate classes of subscribers and rates may reflect the increased cost of providing service to isolated or sparsely populated areas. 
(d)  Should the grantee desire to change any rate or rates, it shall notify each subscriber and the franchising authority, in writing, of the intended change, at least sixty (60) days prior to the date the change is to be effective. The franchising authority may, if it so elects, review any rate proposal at a public hearing of which all parties shall have at least thirty (30) days' notice. At such hearing, evidence shall be taken and received on all of the elements necessary to be considered in determining the reasonableness of the proposed rates, including the return experienced by the company on its investment. Thereafter, the franchise authority shall decide the matter by a majority vote and render a written decision approving, disapproving or modifying the proposed rate changes. The decision shall set forth complete findings of fact and conclusions regarding all of the basic elements considered in determining the rates, as set forth above.

No amendment shall be adopted except after full, open public hearing affording due process, and no amendment substantially amending the existing rights and obligations of the grantee shall be adopted without the grantee's consent.

(3)  A thorough description of the proposed cable television system to be installed and operated; the manner in which the applicant proposes to construct, install, maintain and operate the same; and the extent and manner in which existing or future poles or other facilities of public utility companies will be used in the proposed system, together with a map or maps delineating proposed service areas if the applicant proposes to serve less than the entire franchise entity. 
(4)  A schedule of proposed rates and charges to all classes of subscribers for both installation and monthly service, and a copy of the proposed service agreement between the applicant and its proposed subscribers.

(c)  No application for a franchise shall be accepted by the franchise authority until it has published its intention to award such a franchise or franchises and solicited the filing of applications. Applications shall then be accepted from all interested parties for a period of sixty (60) days or such other period as may be set by the franchise authority, but none shall be accepted thereafter. 
(d)  The franchise authority shall then:

(2)  Specify a public place where interested parties may inspect all such bona fide applications. 
(e)  After hearing the evidence, opinions and representations of all interested parties including members of the public, the franchise authority shall within a time period to be determined by the franchise authority then render a decision awarding a franchise to one (1) or more applicants (or rejecting all applicants if it shall so elect) based upon its findings as to the relative qualifications of the applicants to render satisfactory CATV service and such other factors as the franchise authority in its sole discretion shall deem appropriate.

(b)  Upon receipt of a request for a renewal of a franchise, the franchise authority shall schedule a public hearing on the matter, giving at least thirty (30) days' notice of such hearing and any franchise modifications proposed by either the grantee or the franchise authority. After hearing all of the evidence, opinions and representations, the franchise authority shall then render a decision to renew or not to renew the grantee's franchise, and if the former course is taken whether or not its franchise should be modified in any way. A grantee shall file its acceptance of a renewal franchise within thirty (30) days after it is offered by the franchise authority and upon failure to do so shall be conclusively presumed to have consented to the expiration of its franchise. 
(c)  In the event of nonrenewal or termination of a franchise, the franchise entity hereby agrees to purchase, or to require any successor grantee to purchase, the grantee's facilities at a cost not to exceed its then fair market value, with a reduction for any uncompensated damages incurred by the franchise entity in connection with the grantee's operation. If such fair market value cannot be agreed upon by the parties, it shall be determined by a three-member arbitration panel, one (1) member to be selected by the franchise authority, one (1) by the franchise and the third member by the two (2) members first named.

If a finding of a violation or a repeat violation has been made as provided in this part, a hearing shall not be necessary for the issuance of the order imposing the fine. 
(b)  (1) The fine imposed pursuant to this section shall not exceed two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) per day for a first violation and shall not exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day for a repeat violation, and, in addition, may include all costs of repairs pursuant to subsection (a). 
(2)  In determining the amount of the fine, if any, the Board shall consider the following factors: 
a.  The gravity of the violation; 
b.  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the action; and 
c.  Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
(3)  The Board may reduce a fine imposed pursuant to this section. 
(c)  A certified copy of an order imposing a fine may be recorded in the Public Records of Broward County, Florida, and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order may be enforced in the same manner as court judgement by the sheriffs of this State, including levy against the personal property, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed pursuant to this part shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered in a suit to foreclose on a lien filed pursuant to this section, whichever occurs first. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this section runs in favor of the Town Commission, and the Town Commission may execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered pursuant to this section. After three (3) months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the Board may authorize the Town Attorney to foreclose on the lien. No lien created pursuant to the provisions of this part may be foreclosed on real property which is homestead under Section 4, Article X of the State Constitution.

Sec. 7-9. - Duration of lien. 
    No lien provided under the Local Government Code Enforcement Boards Act or this chapter shall continue for a period longer than twenty (20) years after the certified copy of an order imposing a fine has been recorded, unless within that time an action to foreclose on the lien is commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction. In an action to foreclose on a lien, the prevailing party is entitled to recover all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee, that it incurs in the foreclosure. The Town Commission shall be entitled to collect all costs incurred recording and satisfying a valid lien. The continuation of the lien effected by the commencement of the action shall not be good against creditors or subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, unless a notice of lis pendens is recorded.

(b)  Determination by the Town Commission that: 
(1)  Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship; 
(2)  The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances; and 
(3)  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
(c)  Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the variance, if granted, shall be recorded in the Office of the Clerk of the Court in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and 
(d)  If the request is for a variance to allow construction of the lowest floor of a new building, or substantial improvement of a building, below the required elevation, a copy in the record of a written notice from the Floodplain Administrator to the applicant for the variance, specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor, stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation (up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 insurance coverage), and stating that construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property.

(Ord. No. 15-04-01, § 1, 4-1-15) 
Sec. 11-76. - Scope of regulations. 
(a)  The regulations set forth in this division apply to materials recovery facilities which operate within the Town. 
(b)  The provisions of this division shall regulate the operations of materials recovery facilities. These operating regulations are intended to be in addition to those applicable regulations established under Federal, State, and County law or rule. In the event of any conflict between and provision of Federal, State, or County law or rule and any provision of this division, the stricter provision shall apply (that is, the provision which protects the public interest to the greater degree shall apply). 
(c)  Materials recovery facilities are prohibited uses in the Town's M-1 Industrial Zoning District regulations; therefore, any that exist as of February 11, 2015 are non-conforming. Compliance with the Town's M-1 Industrial Zoning District Regulations for such non-conforming uses shall be required. 
(d)  Materials recovery facilities that operate within the Town shall continuously comply with the regulations of this division. 
(e)  No person shall operate a materials recovery facility, or change the operation or processes of a materials recovery facility, without having received a certificate of conformance from the Town. A certificate of conformance shall be valid for a five (5) year time period from the date it is issued, after which it shall expire. All operations of the materials recovery facility shall be in accordance with the regulations of this division and any special conditions of the certificate of conformance. An issued certificate of conformance shall not relieve a materials recovery facility from meeting the requirements of this division, nor shall same create an equitable estoppel against the town, or vested rights against the enforcement of this division's regulations, or any other defense or excuse or avoidance to the enforcement of the provisions of this division as same exist at the time the certificate is issued, or to the enforcement of the provisions of this division as same may change during the time when any issued certificate is effective. The primary purpose of the certificate of conformance is to have a required periodic review of a materials recovery facility by the Town to help ensure that materials recovery facilities remain compliant with all applicable requirements of the Town. 
(Ord. No. 15-04-01, § 2, 4-1-15) 
Sec. 11-77. - Application and regulations.

(8)  In the event the application for a certificate of conformity is being made as a result of a reason other than the prior certificate's five (5) year expiring, the Town Staff is authorized to accept the accompanying information identified above from the date of the last application for a certificate of conformity, as opposed to over the prior five (5) year period. If the application is the first application, the information submitted shall cover the five (5) year period prior to the application date, unless the Town Commission requests a longer time period. 
(f)  The Town Staff will review the application information, and such other information and evidence as staff determines bear on the standards and criteria set forth below, and shall present the application and evidence to the Town Commission with a recommendation. The Town Commission will review the application, and shall, after conducting a public meeting on each application, either approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application. 
(g)  The following standards and criteria and regulations shall apply in reviewing an application, and shall continue to be applicable to the operation of the materials recovery facility after the certificate is granted: 
(1)  That the facility has received all required permits and approvals from other governmental entities that have jurisdiction over its operations. 
(2)  That all improvements on the site of the facility, and in the building in which the facility operates, comply with the applicable requirements of the Florida Building Code (and all incorporated life safety codes). 
(3)  That the facility's operation complies with the most recent previously issued certificate of conformity. 
(4)  That the site of the facility (and all activity proposed and described in the application) complies with all zoning and land use regulations of the Town. 
(5)  That the insurance contained within the application is sufficient to satisfy the minimum reasonable specified requirements of the Town. 
(6)  That there are no outstanding violations of the Town Code of Ordinances that have not been either subjected to adjudication or resolved to the Town Commission's satisfaction. 
(7)  That there are no outstanding violations of Federal or State law or rule that relate to whether the facility is complying with regulations concerning the facility's operation or compliance with environmental law and regulation. 
(8)  That traffic circulation for the facility will not result in trucks being parked, stored, or queued within or on right of way: 
a.  Adjacent to the site where the facility operates; and 
b.  Within or adjacent to any property which enjoys any type of residential zoning classification. 
(9)  That cleaning and disinfecting operations occur at least twice each day, seven (7) days per week, three hundred sixty five (365) days per year, to assist in controlling the emission of objectionable odors from the facility, and that the odor reduction plan appears reasonable to prevent objectionable odors from being detectable at the property line of the premises, and to prevent the nuisance conditions described in subsections 12-76(c), (d), and (e) of this Code. 
(10)  That the facility does not employ the use of incinerators, open fires, air curtain incinerators, solid waste combustors, trench burning, pulverizers, or landfills in the processing of solid waste. 
(11)  That the facility does not engage in composting processes. 
(12)  That the [facility] does not accept for processing at the site, and does not process: 
a.  Biological waste; 
b.  Sludge; 
c.  Ash residue; 
d.  Agricultural wastes; 
e.  Waste tires or waste tire residuals; 
f.  Nuclear source or byproduct materials regulated under Chapter 404, Florida Statutes or under the Federal Atomic Energy Act of 1954; 
g.  Suspended or dissolved materials in suspended sewage effluent or irrigation return flows, or other regulated point source discharges; 
h.  Fluid or wastes associated natural gas or crude oil exploration; 
i.  Solid waste that is generated as a result of a storm event that is the subject of an emergency order entered by any governmental entity other than the Town Commission of Pembroke Park; or 
j.  Hazardous waste. 
(13)  That the "materials recovery facility" is not a "trash transfer station," such that the facility recovers more than an "incidental amount" of its incoming solid waste in the form of recyclable materials, and does not have as a primary purpose the holding and storage of solid waste for transport to a disposal facility. In the absence of statutory guidance, guidance from the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation in the form of an agency rule, or binding case law precedent that construes or defines "primary purpose" in the context of F.S. § 403.703(38)(2013) or "incidental" in the context of R. 62-701.200 (120) F.A.C. (collectively, "guiding legal authority"), and to provide direction to the Town Staff for application of the definition of a Trash Transfer Station in the absence of such guiding legal authority, a Facility that accepts solid waste, and extracts less than five percent (5%) of the total tons of the facility's incoming of 250 solid waste stream over any calendar six-month period as recycled materials, and then effects a transfer of the non-extracted, residual solid waste stream off site for disposal or processing off site shall be deemed by Town Staff to be a "trash transfer station" and not a "materials recovery facility." When, as, and if such guiding legal authority is created, the Town shall follow same and apply same. Additionally, given the first deadline in which to obtain a certificate of conformity is June 1, 2015, the first six-month measuring period shall be November 2014 to May of 2015. 
(14)  That the safety plan is reasonable. 
(15)  That all processing of solid waste occurs indoors and on a poured concrete pad having a minimum thickness of four (4) inches. 
(16)  That the facility is operated to minimize the discharge of leachate to the environment, control objectionable odors, litter, dust, and other fugitive particulates from the building wherein the processing occurs. 
(17)  That absent emergency: 
a.  Putrescible solid waste and solid waste that is mixed with putrescible solid waste shall be removed from the facility not more than twenty-four (24) hours after acceptance, 
b.  Nonputrescible solid waste is not stored at the facility for more than one (1) week, and c. that recovered materials are not stored at the facility for more than six (6) months. 
(18)  That the application is complete. 
(19)  That the facility converts, on average, a material amount of its incoming volume of solid waste to recyclables. Given the State public policy that recycling is encouraged, and to promote the implementation of technology and processes in materials recovery facilities that will likely increase over time the efficiencies of extracting recyclables from the solid waste stream, the Town Commission will determine such material average by resolution in evaluating the application in consideration of: 
a.  Recycling averages reported by other similar kinds of materials recovery facilities in South Florida that are outside of the Town; 
b.  The nature, types, and investments in equipment (and extent of depreciation thereof) of the facility within the Town; 
c.  Current regulatory goals and objectives at the State and County level for recycling and regulation as may exist; and 
d.  Such other reports and evaluations concerning materials recovery facility recycling efficiencies as the Town Commission may deem appropriate. In the event the facility does not meet the determined standard in light of this criteria, a plan for compliance with such standard shall be submitted which shall demonstrate achievement within a reasonable time. 
(20)  That the facility does not accept more than twenty-two thousand five hundred (22,500) tons in any month 1 [] of solid waste at the Facility for processing. This number may be temporarily increased by the Town Commission as necessary to respond to declared States of Emergency. 
(21)  The facility remains limited to a maximum lot size of two (2) acres and a maximum building area of thirty thousand (30,000) square feet. 
(22)  That all of the facility's processing operations are conducted inside a completely enclosed structure, and on a site which provides an adequate parking area and circulation area for truck staging, unloading and loading arrangements on the facility's property. No loading, staging, or storage activities shall be permitted off of the facility's property (such as, but not limited to, within the public rights-of-way). If approved by the Town, weighing activity may occur outside next to the building. 
(23)  That the operation of the facility does not cause or create a nuisance or annoyance to the public or to surrounding property owners. Nuisances shall include, but not be limited to, blocking access, disrupting traffic, and any of the conditions described in section 12-76 of this Code. 
(24)  That all sites where the processed solid waste is disposed have appropriate permits and licenses to operate. 
(25)  That the local contact information is up to date and reasonably detailed and sufficient. 
(h)  The hours of operation shall be limited to Monday through Saturday from six (6:00) a.m. to seven (7:00) p.m., except for odor control and cleaning operations, and except for clerical, bookkeeping and related administrative activities which may be conducted at any time. In addition to the above, the staging or parking of trucks on public roadways within the Town, or at the site, prior to the above operating times, is strictly prohibited. 
(i)  If it is determined by the Town that the applicant is not complying with the conditions of approval of the certificate of conformance, or otherwise operates so as to violate the Town's Code or constitute a nuisance, the Town Commission may revoke the certificate after conducting a public hearing. If a public hearing is held for the purpose of revoking a certificate of conformity, the applicant shall be notified by certified mail not less than thirty (30) days prior to any such hearing. If a certificate of conformity is revoked, the Town Commission may require all operations at the materials recovery facility to cease within a reasonable time after all solid waste on the premises as of the date of the Town Commission action has been processed and removed from the site and the building cleaned. 
(j)  The materials recovery facility shall be responsible for the actions of any truck drivers accessing or exiting the site in terms of compliance with paragraph (g)(8), and (h) above or (k) below. In the event a truck should fail to use the approved route or violate paragraph (h) above or (k) below, a financial penalty in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per occurrence shall be paid to the Town. 
(k)  No truck or trailer delivering solid waste materials or picking up recyclables or solid waste or other matter shall be parked on any public roadway in the Town prior to six (6:00) a.m. or after seven (7:00) p.m. No truck or trailer used for any solid waste business shall be parked within three hundred (300) feet of a residentially zoned area at any time. 
(l)  Record keeping and reporting: The owner or operator of a solid waste conveyance or disposal business operating in the Town shall: 
(1)  Maintain a record on-site, recording daily, in tons, of the total quantity of solid waste received and processed, and the separate quantities for:

Sec. 13.5-25. - Wetlands protection. 
(a)  Purpose and intent. 
(1)  Pembroke Park finds that protection of wetlands described and/or mapped in the Town's Comprehensive Plan promotes the well being of the residents and wildlife of Pembroke Park. It is further found that wetlands serve many beneficial functions, as listed below: 
a.  Wetlands provide natural storage and conveyance of floodwaters, and minimize erosion and sedimentation by reducing flood flows and the velocity of floodwaters. 
b.  Wetlands adjoining water bodies minimize erosion and sedimentation by reducing flood flows and the velocity of floodwaters. 
c.  Wetlands assimilate, filter and help decompose sediments, nutrients, and other natural and man-made pollutants that would otherwise degrade surface and ground waters. 
d.  Wetlands support commercial and recreational fishing by providing habitat, essential nutrients and hatcheries for aquatic life. 
e.  Wetlands provide habitat for rare and endangered species, and provide essential breeding and protective habitats for waterfowl, other birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and shellfish. 
(2)  This section is therefore provided for the purpose of protecting wetlands and their beneficial functions, while also protecting the rights of property owners. It is specifically the intent of this section to maintain water quality, maintain wetland wildlife habitats, and to protect scenic vistas in wetlands areas. 
Reference: Conservation Policy 5.3.4. 
(b)  Applicability and determination of wetland boundary. 
(1)  For the purposes of this section, wetlands include the most landward extent of the following: 
a.  Areas within the dredge and fill jurisdiction of the Department of Environmental Regulation as authorized by Section 403 of the Florida Statutes. 
b.  Areas within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as authorized by Section 404, Clean Water Act or Section 10, River and Harbor Act. 
c.  Areas within the jurisdiction of the South Florida Water Management District pursuant to Section 40D-4 and 40D-40, Florida Administrative Code. 
d.  Littoral vegetation shelf around all man-made lakes. 
(2)  The boundary shall be determined and proposed by the applicant and approved by the Town's Commission, through compilation of relevant available evidence, specific to a particular water body or wetlands, and including the following indicators: botanical, physical, geomorphological, water level records, and controlled lake elevation. 
(3)  Determination of wetlands boundary. Typically, the delineation of jurisdictional wetland areas is established in the field after a standardized, multi-parameter assessment, following which preliminary regulatory agency approval is acquired and the upland-wetland boundary is located and mapped by professional survey methods. In lieu of a field survey, wetlands boundary line approved by the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation (DER), Department of Natural Resources (DNR), South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE) (as appropriate), the applicant may determine said boundary(ies) through competent compilation and interpretation of relevant, available evidence specific to a particular water body or approval. The wetlands boundary(ies) shall be established based on evidence of vegetation, soils, hydrology or some combination of these, or as supported by other indicators defined below. 
Any wetland boundary delineation intended to be included in the area and [for] permitting purposes must have prior approval from applicable wetland regulatory agency(ies). 
(c)  Standards for protection. 
(1)  Unless specifically permitted elsewhere in this code, no development activity shall be undertaken in a protected wetlands area. 
(2)  Exemptions. Certain activities are presumed to have an insignificant adverse effect on the beneficial functions of a protected wetlands area. The following uses and activities are presumed to have an insignificant adverse effect and shall not be prohibited unless competent and substantial evidence to the contrary is provided during development review. (Some of these activities may require written notice of exemption from other regulatory agencies; acquisition of such notice is the responsibility of the applicant.) 
a.  Scenic, historic, wildlife, or scientific preserves. 
b.  Minor maintenance or emergency repair to existing structure or improved areas. 
c.  Cleared walking trails having no structural components. 
d.  Timber catwalks and docks four (4) feet or less in width. 
e.  Commercial or recreational fishing, hunting or trapping, and creation and maintenance of temporary blinds. 
f.  Cultivating agricultural or horticultural products that occur naturally on the site. 
g.  Constructing fences where no fill activity is required and where navigational access will not be impaired by construction of the fence. 
h.  Developing an area that no longer functions as a wetland, except a former wetland that has been filled or altered in violation of any rule, regulation, statute, or this code. The developer must demonstrate that the water regime has been permanently altered, either artificially or naturally, in a manner to preclude the area from maintaining surface water of hydroperiodicity necessary to sustain wetland structure and function. If the water regime of a wetland has been artificially altered, but wetland species remain the dominant vegetation of the area, the Town's Commission shall determine the feasibility of restoring the altered hydrology. If the wetland may be restored at a cost that is reasonable in relation to benefits to be derived from the restored wetland, the developer shall, as a condition of development, restore the wetland and comply with the requirements of this section. 
i.  Developing a "wetlands stormwater discharge facility" or "treatment wetland" in accordance with state permits received under Chapters 17-25 and 17-6, Florida Administrative Code.

Sec. 13.5-36. - Handicapped access. 
(a)  Level parking spaces shall be reserved for physically handicapped persons according to the following requirements: 
Total Spaces 
Provided Spaces Required to 
be Reserved  up to    25 1  25 to    50 2  51 to    75 3  76 to   100 4 101 to   150 5 151 to   200 6 201 to   300 7 301 to   400 8 401 to   500 9 501 to 1,000 2% of total Over 1,000 20 plus 2 for each 100 over 1,000  
(b)  Parking spaces reserved for physically handicapped persons shall meet the following design and location requirements: 
(1)  All spaces shall be accessible to curb ramp or curb cut, when necessary to allow access to building, structure, or use served, and shall be so located that users are not compelled to wheel behind parked vehicles. 
(2)  Diagonal or perpendicular parking spaces shall be a minimum of twelve (12) feet wide. 
(3)  Parallel parking spaces shall be located either at the beginning or end of a block or adjacent to an alley entrance. Curbs adjacent to such premises shall be a height which will not interfere with the opening and closing of motor vehicle doors. 
(4)  Each such parking space shall be prominently outlined with blue paint and posted with a nonmovable, fixed sign of a color and design approved by the Florida Department of Transportation, bearing the internationally accepted wheelchair symbol and the caption "PARKING BY DISABLED PERMIT ONLY." 
(Ord. No. 89-10-2, § 1 (Exhibit A, 3060), 10-18-89) 
Sec. 13.5-37. - Transit bus stops. 
(a)  Any development with a parking requirement of more than three hundred fifty (350) vehicles shall provide and dedicate to the public land area for a bus loading/unloading stop. 
(b)  The land area dedicated shall be sufficient provide a bus stop with shelter and a separate paved bus lane. Design of the bus lane shall be as specified by Broward County Mass Transit Division. 
(c)  With the approval of the Town Commission and Broward County Mass Transit Division, bus stops may be located at an appropriate site within the development project. 
(Ord. No. 89-10-2, § 1 (Exhibit A, 3070), 10-18-89) 
Sec. 13.5-38. - Impervious surface requirements for all uses. 
(a)  Impervious surface is that portion of the land which is covered by buildings, pavements, or other cover through which water cannot penetrate. The establishment of an impervious surface ratio provides a control of the intensity of development of land by controlling the amount of land which may be covered by any type of impervious surface. 
(b)  The impervious surface ratio is calculated by dividing the total impervious surface by the gross site area. Water bodies shall be included in the gross site area. 
    (Note: Design alternatives may result in individual lots within a development project exceeding the impervious surface ratio while other lots may be devoted entirely to open space. The Town Commission may require, as a condition of development approval, deed restrictions or covenants which guarantee the maintenance of such open space in perpetuity. It is specifically intended to calculate impervious surface ratio on the gross site area and not on a lot-by-lot basis.) 
(c)  Porous concrete, porous asphalt, porous turf block, or similar materials may be used, subject to the specifications in the Appendices, and shall be calculated based on the portion of the material which is impervious. (For example, if turf block were used which had fifty (50) percent of the coverage of a standard block or pavement materials, only fifty (50) percent of the land area covered by turf block would be counted as impervious. If one hundred (100) percent pervious materials are used, then none of the area covered is calculated as impervious). 
(d)  All proposed development shall comply with the standards given in the table of impervious surface ratios in the following Table E. 
TABLE E. IMPERVIOUS SURFACE RATIOS 
Land Use/Zoning District Maximum Impervious 
Surface Ratio (1) Low intensity residential (1-5 du/acre) 0.65 Moderate density residential (townhouses) 0.60 Medium density residential (6-16 du/acre) 0.55 High density residential (17+du/acre) 0.50 Mixed use 0.70 Professional services/office 0.80 General commercial 0.80 Industrial 0.85 Extractive N/A Public/semi-public 0.60 Transportation/communications/utilities N/A Recreation 0.10 Agriculture 0.05 Conservation N/A T-1 Mobile Home District 0.65  
Example: 4,500 square feet of building, drives, decks on 7,500 square feet lot would have an impervious surface ratio of 0.60. 
The maximum impervious surface ratio is given for each district, regardless of the type use proposed and allowable pursuant to the comprehensive plan. 
(e)  Upon demonstration by the applicant that special conditions peculiar to the location or physical characteristics of a particular site, plat or lot are present, or special conditions resulting from the design of existing facilities or surrounding land uses are present, the zoning official may permit variations from the impervious area standards, including but not limited to: 
(1)  Variations from the stated requirements shall be proportional to mitigating design improvements provided in excess of the minimum required engineering and landscaping standards. 
(2)  The Town may require the owner of a property that does not comply with the impervious surface ratio requirements of this section due to pre-existing, as built conditions such as impervious lot coverage (parking areas, patios, decks, walkways, etc.) to construct alternative stormwater collection and disposal improvements and/or site modifications as a condition for granting a variance from the impervious areas standards set forth in this section. The alternative storm-water collection and disposal improvements and/or site modifications may include, but are not limited to, the removal of existing impervious areas, the installation of new impervious areas (swales, landscaped areas) underground drainage systems (french drains, piping, structures). 
(3)  The impervious surface area ratio non-conformity may not increase for any pre-existing non compliant site.

Sec. 13.5-39. - Protection and use of rights-of-way. 
(a)  No encroachment shall be permitted into existing rights-of-way or corridors designated on the Broward County Trafficways Map, except for temporary use authorized by the Town Commissioners. 
Reference: Future Land Use Policy 1.5.31. 
(b)  Use of the right-of-way for public or private utilities, including, but not limited to, sanitary sewer, potable water, telephone wires, cable television wires, gas lines, or placement specifications of the applicable agency, shall require a right-of-way utilization permit from the Town's Chief Building Official. 
(c)  Sidewalks and bicycle ways may be placed within the right-of-way. Proposed sidewalks and bicycle ways shall be approved by the Director of Engineering. 
(Ord. No. 89-10-2, § 1 (Exhibit A, 3090), 10-18-89) 
Sec. 13.5-39.5. - Vacation of rights-of-way. 
    Applications to vacate a right-of-way shall be recommended for approval upon a finding that all of the following requirements are met: 
(1)  The requested vacation is consistent with the transportation circulation element of the Town and County's Comprehensive Plan. 
(2)  The right-of-way does not provide the sole access to any property. (Remaining access shall not be by easement.) 
(3)  The vacation would not jeopardize the current or future location of any utility. 
(4)  The proposed vacation is not detrimental to the public interest, and provides a positive benefit to the Town generally.

ARTICLE VI. - CONCURRENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 

Sec. 13.5-60. - Purpose, intent and application. 
    Recognizing the primary intent of Florida's Growth Management Act is that facilities and services needed to support development shall be in place concurrently with the impacts of such development, a concurrency management system, based upon a realistic and financially feasible schedule of capital improvements and adequate implementing regulations, has been developed to assure that development orders and permits are issued in such a manner that the necessary facilities and services are available to accommodate the impact of the proposed development. This concurrency management system shall ensure that the adopted level of service standards required for roadways, potable water, sanitary sewer, solid waste, drainage and recreation will be maintained prior to the issuance of a development order and development permit. 
(Ord. No. 89-10-2, § 1 (Exhibit A, 6000), 10-18-89) 
Sec. 13.5-61. - Application of article. 
(a)  The provisions of this article shall apply to any application received after October 1, 1989, for a building permit (as defined herein), rezoning, land use plan amendment, site plan approval, plat approval, or other official action by the Town of Pembroke Park having the effect of permitting the development of land. This does not include any variance or other official action necessary solely for the purpose of issuing a permit, other than a building permit, pursuant to the South Florida Building Code. 
(b)  As provided herein, no development order shall be issued where levels of service for all public services and facilities included in Article V, will not meet or exceed the adopted level of service standards or where the issuance of the development order would result in a reduction in the level of service for any service or facility below those level of service (L.O.S.) standards. 
(c)  Where any public service or facility is currently operating below the adopted level of service standards, or where the issuance of the development order will result in a reduction of the level of service for any service or facility below the level of service standards as set forth in Article V, assurances that facilities or services necessary to serve the proposed development shall be made by one (1) or more of the following means: 
(1)  The necessary facilities are under construction at the time the building permit is issued; or 
(2)  The necessary facilities and services are the subject of a binding executed contract for the construction of the facilities or the provision of the services at the time the building permit is issued; or 
(3)  The necessary facilities are funded and programmed for construction in year one of the Town's, Broward County's or State of Florida's adopted capital budget. 
(d)  Where public facilities and services for a development are provided by the Town or owner/developer, they shall be included in an enforceable developer agreement. An enforceable developer agreement may include, but is not limited to, development agreements pursuant to Section 163.3220, Florida Statutes, or an agreement or development order issued pursuant to Chapter 380, Florida Statutes (see section 13.5-64). 
(e)  For public school concurrency, the applicant shall submit a Public School Impact Application (PSIA) to the Broward County School Board (School Board) for review. Prior to final action on the Town application, the applicant shall submit to the Town a School Capacity Availability Determination Letter (SCAD) from the School Board showing the availability of school capacity sufficient to offset the impact of the proposed development, or the applicant's commitment to provide for the needed capacity. If capacity is not available pursuant to the SCAD letter, the applicant shall provide for the needed capacity through a binding agreement with the School Board to provide said capacity.

The adequacy of the regional transportation system to handle the impact of the proposed development can only be measured utilizing the TRIPS computer model of the Broward County Office of Planning. Consequently, the applicant shall be required to submit a TRIPS analysis prepared within forty-five (45) days of the proposed development. Before a development order is approved, the following findings shall be made by the Town Commission: 
1.  A determination shall be required that the proposed development is not within the compact deferral area for a road segment operating below the adopted level of service, or that subsection 3 below is met. 
2.  A determination shall be required that the proposed development would not create a compact deferral area including the development, or that subsection 3 below is met. 
3.  If the proposed development is within a compact deferral area, or will be within a compact deferral area if the development is approved, one (1) of the following conditions applies: 
i.  The proposed development does not place any trips on the overcapacity link; 
ii.  The Town Commission has approved an action plan to accommodate the traffic impact of the development; or 
iii.  The necessary improvements to provide a level of service D are under construction at the time the permit is issued; or 
iv.  The necessary improvements to provide level of service D are the subject of an executed contract with a road contractor for the immediate construction of the facilities; or 
v.  The necessary improvements for level of service D have been included in year one of the Town's or Broward County's adopted capital improvement budget at the time the development permit is issued; or 
vi.  The necessary improvements for the applicable L.O.S. shall be provided for in an enforceable development agreement and will be available prior to certificates of occupancy that require those facilities. An enforceable development agreement may include, but is not limited to, development agreements pursuant to Section 163.3220, Florida Statutes; or 
vii.  The development is authorized by an approved DRI development order pursuant to Chapter 380, Florida Statutes; or 
viii.  The proposed development is found to have vested rights with regard to any effected road segments; or 
ix.  The proposed development is a government facility which the Town Commission finds is essential to the health or safety of persons residing in or using previously approved or existing development.

Such analysis shall take into consideration existing traffic volume, existing and proposed roadway capacity. In no event shall the L.O.S. for a local road by permitted to be decreased below the L.O.S.D standard. 
(5)  Stormwater management. Compliance with the provisions of sections 13.5-20, 13.5-30 and 13.5-54 of this chapter shall constitute a finding that the adopted level of service standard for stormwater runoff quantity and quality is maintained. Where required, the approval of the South Florida Water Management District and the Broward County Water Resources Management Division shall be obtained prior to the issuance of a development permit. 
(6)  Solid waste. A finding that solid waste facilities and services will be available to serve the needs of the proposed development shall be based upon: 
a.  Availability of capacity in the Broward County sanitary landfill and resource recovery facilities; and 
b.  An assurance letter from a franchised refuse hauler in the case of multifamily and nonresidential developments. 
(7)  Recreation. A finding that parks and recreation facilities and services will be adequate to serve the needs of the proposed development shall be based on compliance with Code section 5-43, Parks and Recreation Fee. No development permit shall be issued unless in compliance with the provisions of section 5-43. 
(8)  Public schools. This section shall only apply to applications for residential rezonings, new subdivision plats or replats with a residential component and new residential site plans. 
    The adequacy of the Public Schools system to handle the impact of a proposed residential development can only be determined by the School Board. Consequently, the applicant shall be required to submit a School Capacity Availability Determination Letter (SCAD) prepared within sixty (60) days of the application date to the Town. 
    The Town Commission shall not approve any residential application, as defined above, unless the residential development is exempt or vested from the requirements of public school concurrency or until a School Capacity Availability Determination Letter (SCAD) has been received from the School Board confirming that capacity is available or if capacity is not available, that proportionate share mitigation has been accepted by the School Board. The procedures for obtaining a SCAD letter may be found in the Broward County Land Development Code Section 5-182 (m).

(14)  Easements. 
a.  Easements shall be provided for public and private utilities where necessary and as required by the Town for the utilities involved and shall be at least ten (10) feet in total width. 
b.  Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, canal, or stream, there shall be provided a drainage easement or right-of-way conforming substantially with the lines of such watercourses. Parallel streets or maintenance easements may be required where necessary for service or maintenance. 
c.  Easements may be required for drainage purposes of such size and location as determined by the Town Engineer, or by a drainage district, if the plat lies within its jurisdiction. 
(15)  Street intersections. 
a.  Streets shall be laid out to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles. No street shall intersect another at an angle of less than sixty (60) degrees, except at a "Y" intersection of two (2) minor streets. 
b.  Multiple intersections involving the junction of more than two (2) streets shall be prohibited except where found to be unavoidable by the Town.

(16)  Connection to public streets. The street system of any area to be platted shall have a direct connection, over public rights-of-way, to streets or trafficways, unless otherwise approved by the Town. 
a.  Lots. 
1.  The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will provide satisfactory and desirable building sites, properly related to topography and to the character of the surrounding development. 
2.  Lot dimensions and areas shall not be less than specified by applicable provisions of the zoning regulations. 
3.  Corner lots shall be a minimum of five (5) feet wider than the minimum width required by the zoning regulations for interior lots. 
4.  Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to street lines. 
5.  Double frontage and reverse lots for residential use shall be avoided, except where essential to provide separation of residential development from trafficways or to overcome specific handicaps of topography and orientation. A planting screen strip of at least five (5) feet, and across which there shall be no right of vehicular movement or use, shall be provided along the property line of lots abutting such trafficway or other disadvantageous situation. 
6.  Every lot shall abut upon and have permanent access to a public street unless otherwise approved by the Town and lots shall have a street frontage of not less than twenty-five (25) feet.

Included within the fee are all taxes, licenses, fees, in-kind contributions accepted pursuant to F.S. § 337.401, and other impositions except ad valorem taxes and amounts for assessments for special benefits, such as sidewalks, street pavings, and similar improvements, and occupational license taxes levied or imposed by the Town upon the telecommunications company. 
b.  In the event that a telecommunications company which provides telecommunications services defined as toll services in F.S. § 203.012(7), occupies the Town's rights-of-way, the telecommunications company shall pay to the Town annually five hundred dollars ($500) per linear mile, which amount is prorated for any portion thereof, for any cable, fiber optic, or other pathway that makes physical use of the Town's rights-of-way. Such annual fee shall be prorated to reflect the expiration date of this section and shall be payable annually, in advance. If a telecommunications company that is required to pay a fee pursuant to this subparagraph (a)(ii) increases the amount of its facilities occupying the Town's rights-of-way after such advance payment has been made, but prior to the expiration date of this section, the fees due for the additional facilities shall be prorated and paid in full at the time the facilities are installed in the Town's rights-of-way. 
The fee or other consideration imposed pursuant to this subsection b. shall not apply in any manner to any telecommunications company which provides local telephone service as defined in Section 203.012(3), Florida Statutes (2000), for any services provided by such telecommunications company. 
c.  Telecommunications company, as used in this section, shall have the meaning set forth in F.S. § 364.02(12).

The installment payments shall be based upon such gross receipts on recurring local service revenues for the immediately preceding installment period or portion thereof after the effective date of this section, and shall be made within thirty (30) calendar days following the end of the period. Past due payments or underpayments shall bear interest accrued from the last day of the quarter for which the payment was due. Interest shall be paid at the Florida statutory rate of interest on judgments as established by F.S. § 55.03. Payments shall include a statement as to how the fee amount was determined and the statement shall be certified by the telecommunications company's chief financial officer or other duly authorized representative of the company. 
(3)  If the Town wishes to verify the payments due to the Town under this section, the telecommunications company shall permit the Town or a designated representative of the Town, upon reasonable advance written notice, and during normal business hours at the location of the telecommunications company where such records are maintained in the Town, at another location satisfactory to the Town, or elsewhere pursuant to subsections a. or b. below, to review or audit the telecommunications company's billing and payment records kept in the ordinary course of business upon which the payments were based. If a telecommunications company's records are not maintained in the Town, the telecommunications company shall either: 
a.  Pay all reasonable expenses, including travel, following the provisions of F.S. § 112.061(6), (7) and (8), to the Town for the Town to have a review or audit performed; or 
b.  Provide the Town with access to copies of the telecommunications company's records in the Town or within fifty-five (55) miles of the Town or by an electronic method satisfactory to the Town. 
However, without the specific written consent of a telecommunications company's audit representative, no company records may be duplicated or taken from the telecommunications company's premises, and the Town shall maintain the confidentiality of the information disclosed in these records and use the information solely for the purposes of verifying payments by the telecommunications company. No acceptance of payment shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the Town may have for sums due and payable under this section unless the Town agrees in writing. In the event that the Town, pursuant to final audit findings, determines that there exists a difference between the amount due to the Town and the amount paid to the Town, indicating an underpayment to the Town, in excess of five (5) percent of the amount due, such telecommunications company shall pay all reasonable costs, fees and expenses of the audit. 
(4)  This section is adopted consistent with the provisions of F.S. § 337.401, and other applicable provisions of law. This section shall not be construed as a waiver or limitation of the power of the Town to prescribe and enforce reasonable rules and regulations pursuant to applicable provisions of law. 
(5)  If required by applicable Town ordinances, codes or regulations, a telecommunications company shall be registered with the Town and obtain all permits that may be required by the Town regarding occupation of the Town's public rights-of-way for telecommunication facilities.

In addition to the foregoing, all such facilities after installation and approval by the Town engineers shall be conveyed to the Town without payment of any charges by the Town to the owner of said facilities. If this method of payment is used by owner and/or developer, no certificates of occupancy of the buildings on the site for which said credits are given shall be issued by the Town until such time that all of the foregoing requirements have been complied with in every respect. 
(Ord. No. 85-12-1, § 5, 12-11-85) 
Sec. 26-35. - Disposition of proceeds. 
    All charges or assessments collected by virtue of this division shall be deposited in a special and separate account to be designated, "Sewer and Wastewater Capital Improvement Account," and expenditures from said special account shall be restricted to the construction of capital improvements to the Town's sanitary sewer system such as the installation of collection, transmission and distribution lines and the oversizing and enlargement of same; enlargement of and/or construction of new pumping, storage and treatment facilities and other construction related thereto, such as manholes and lift stations, all of which being directly related to the expansion and extensions of such system necessitated by the impact of new uses being added to the utility system. In addition to the foregoing, such funds may be expended for engineering and legal expenses related to such improvements or to the account. The expenditure from the above account of any sums for maintenance, repairs, salaries or other noncapital, or noncapital-related items is expressly prohibited. The above-related sewer capital improvement fund is to be used solely for improvements to the Town's sanitary sewer system in accordance with and subject to the above-recited restrictions.

Sec. 26-102. - Stormwater management utility fee created. 
(a)  A stormwater management utility fee (the "fee"), is hereby created and imposed on all developed property within the Town for the services and facilities provided by the stormwater management system. The developed property owner is responsible for payment of the fee. For the purpose of imposing the fee, all developed property within the Town shall be classified either as:

If the property is tenant occupied, the property owner may request that the Town bill the tenant for such fee. Such instructions shall be in writing. If the property is tenant occupied and the tenant is to be billed for such fee, any delinquent fee shall be charged against any utility deposit then held by the Town. If the tenant fails to pay the fee, the property owner shall remain liable for the fee. 
(c)  Any fee remaining unpaid on a developed property for ninety (90) days shall constitute a lien in favor of the Town against said property, and the Town Attorney is authorized and directed to record a lien for such unpaid fee in the public records of Broward County, Florida. Such lien shall be superior in dignity to any encumbrances on the said property, whether occurring prior to or subsequent to such lien being recorded, except for tax liens, and may be foreclosed by the Town as provided by law. 
(d)  Statements for the stormwater management utility fee shall be payable at the same time in the same manner and subject to the same penalties as they are otherwise set forth for other utility fees administered by the Town unless another method is approved by the Town Commission. The property owner will be notified of any delinquency in the payment of the stormwater management utility fee in the same manner that delinquent water and sewer bills are notified, and the failure to pay such fee as is otherwise provided in the statement shall subject the owner of the developed property to all other penalties and charges available under the law relative to the discontinuance of such utility services.

In addition, one (1) tree shall be provided for each seventy-five (75) lineal feet of such landscape barrier or fractional part thereof. Such trees shall be located between the common lot line and the off-street parking area or other vehicular use area. Each such tree shall be planted in at least twenty-five (25) square feet of planting area with a minimum dimension of at least five (5) feet. Each such planting area shall be landscaped with grass, ground cover or other landscape material excluding paving in addition to the required tree. The provisions of this subsection shall not be applicable in the following situations: 
(1)  When a property line abuts a dedicated alley, or to those portions of the property that are opposite a building or other structure located on the abutting property; 
(2)  Where a proposed parking area or other vehicular use area abuts an existing hedge, wall or other durable landscape barrier on an abutting property, such existing barrier may be used to satisfy the landscape barrier requirements of this section provided that such existing barrier meets all applicable standards of this article and protection against vehicular encroachment is provided for hedges; 
(3)  Where the abutting property is zoned or used for nonresidential uses, only the tree provision with its planting area as prescribed in this subsection shall be required; however, the number of trees may be reduced to one (1) tree for every one hundred twenty-five (125) lineal feet or fraction thereof but all perimeter requirements shall apply within the front setback area. 
(Ord. No. 72-4-1, § 4e., 4-5-72) 
Sec. 27-39. - Parking area interior landscaping. 
(a)  Off-street parking areas shall have at least ten (10) square feet of interior landscaping for each parking space excluding those spaces abutting the perimeter for which landscaping is required by other sections of this division and excluding all parking spaces which are directly served by an aisle abutting and running parallel to such a perimeter. In addition, other vehicular use areas shall have one (1) square foot of landscaped area for each one hundred (100) square feet or fraction thereof of paved area for the first fifty thousand (50,000) square feet excluding the first five thousand (5,000) square feet of paved area plus one (1) square foot of landscaped area for each two hundred (200) square feet or fraction thereof of paved area for all paved area over fifty thousand (50,000) square feet. Where the property contains both parking areas and other vehicular use areas, the two (2) types of areas may be separated for the purposes of determining the vehicular use area by first multiplying the total number of parking spaces by four hundred (400) and subtracting the resulting figure from the total square footage of the paved area. 
    Vehicular use areas shall be separated from buildings and structures by an average of ten (10) feet of landscaped area. Not more than fifty (50) percent of the width of this area may be comprised of sidewalks. This criteria shall not apply to those portions of a site area within commercial or industrial zoning districts where loading areas with overhead doors exist. 
(b)  Each separate landscaped area shall contain a minimum of fifty (50) square feet and shall have a minimum dimension of at least five (5) feet and shall include at least one (1) tree having a clear trunk of at least five (5) feet, with the remaining area adequately landscaped 
with grass, shrubs, ground cover or other authorized landscaped material not to exceed three (3) feet in height. The total number of trees shall not be less than one (1) for each one hundred (100) square feet or fraction thereof of required interior landscaped area. Such landscaped areas shall be located in such a manner as to divide and break up the expanse of paving. Planter islands must be located no further apart than an average of ten (10) parking spaces (maximum of fourteen (14) parking spaces in a row) across the drive aisle and at the terminus of all rows of parking. All planter islands must be curbed to prevent vehicular encroachment. 
(c)  In other vehicular use areas where the strict application of this section will seriously limit the function of the area, the required landscaping may be located near the perimeter of the paved area including such perimeters which may be adjacent to a building on the site. Such required interior landscaping which is relocated as herein provided shall be in addition to the perimeter landscaping requirements. 
(d)  The front of a vehicle may encroach upon any interior landscaped area when such area is at least three and one-half (31/2) feet in depth per abutting parking space and protected by wheel stops or curbing. Two (2) feet of such landscaped area may be part of the required depth of each abutting parking space.

Sec. 27-71. - Findings of fact. 
    The Town Commission hereby finds that trees use their leaf surface to trap and filter out ash, dust and pollen in the air, thereby helping to alleviate air pollution; that trees help prevent erosion of the soil, thereby helping to protect the resources of the Town belonging to the general public; that removal of trees causes increased surface runoff, which contributes to water pollution; that protection of trees increases the value of property, enhances the economic integrity of an area, providing a camouflage for harsh scenery and softens the outline of masonry, metal and glass, thereby being a part of comprehensive land use planning; that trees slow down forceful wind velocities and cut noise pollution; and that the living communities of native trees are a valuable educational and aesthetic natural heritage; and that based on these factual considerations, this article shall be a minimum standards ordinance.

Permits for the removal, relocation or replacement of trees covered in this article shall be obtained by submitting an application on a form prescribed by the Town. The permit fee, except as otherwise provided, shall be five dollars ($5.00) per tree to be destroyed. No fee shall be charged for trees which are relocated or lie within a utility easement and are required to be removed in order to provide utility service to the property.

Recognizing that the production of food is essential for the existence and health of the population, and that agricultural use of land is continuous and can provide employment and income for the population indefinitely, and whereas South Florida's agriculture plays a major role in the country's economy and provides a substantial portion of our nation's winter food crops, and also taking note of the large number of tree removals which agricultural use by its nature necessitates, the fee to be charged applicants who seek to destroy trees in conjunction with an agricultural purpose shall be charged at a rate of two dollars ($2.00) per tree destroyed, up to a maximum of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per acre. This reduced fee, however, is to be charged only upon the applicant's submitting to the Town a covenant running with the land for a term of not less than five (5) years indicating that the land noted therein shall not be utilized by the owner for any purpose other than an agricultural purpose. Such covenant shall be promptly filed with the appropriate officer for recording in the same manner as any other instrument affecting the title to real property and may only be released prior to its termination by a written instrument of the Town Commission releasing the owner from the terms of the covenant and which instrument must be promptly recorded in the same manner as any other instrument affecting the title to real property. The release shall only be made to the owner, however, upon payment to the Town of the permit fees that would have been charged for a nonagricultural tree removal permit less the amounts actually paid for the permit at the time of application.

ARTICLE IV. - FERTILIZER REGULATIONS 

Sec. 27-101. - Purpose and intent. 
    This Article requires the use of Best Management Practices which provide specific management guidelines to minimize negative secondary and cumulative environmental effects associated with the misuse of fertilizers.

Collectively, these water bodies are an asset critical to the environmental, recreational, cultural and economic well-being of the Town residents and the health of the public. Overgrowth of algae and vegetation hinder the effectiveness of flood attenuation provided by natural and constructed stormwater conveyances. Regulation of nutrients, including both phosphorus and nitrogen contained in fertilizer, ill help improve and maintain water and habitat quality.

An application fee as set forth in a resolution adopted by the Town Commission shall be paid by the petitioner upon the filing of the application. 
(2)  The application shall contain or be accompanied by all information necessary for the Town staff to determine that the proposed structure(s) or use(s) shall satisfy the requirements for special exception use specified or set forth herein. Such information shall include a site development plan, landscape and buffer plan, proposed hours of operation, proposed use limitations, and any other information which may be required by the Town Manager or his designee in order to determine compliance with the requirements of this section. 
(3)  The application shall be presented to the Planning and Zoning Board, along with the recommendation of the Town Manager or his designee, for consideration at a public hearing. The Board shall, in turn, make a specific recommendation to the Town Commission containing any reasonable conditions necessary to permit the requested use and satisfy the requirements for special exception use as specified in this section. If the Board determines that the proposed special exception use does not meet the requirements of this section, the Board shall recommend denial. 
(4)  No sooner than fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of the Planning and Zoning Board recommendation, the Town Commission shall consider the application along with the recommendation of the Town Manager or his designee and the Planning and Zoning Board. If approved with conditions, the building permit, occupational license or certificate of use, as appropriate, shall contain those conditions. 
(5)  The standards and guidelines to be applied by the Planning and Zoning Board and by the Town Commission in considering applications for a special exception use are as follows: 
a.  An otherwise lawful activity may, because of its location, interfere with the property rights of adjacent landowners by creating an unreasonable disruption to the area by way of increasing vehicular traffic, noise, light, storage and use of dangerous materials, intensity of development and other reasons. It is the intent of this section that each application for approval of a special exception use be evaluated in light of the unique characteristics of the neighborhood in which it is to be located and the positive and negative effects that it will have on that neighborhood and the community in general. Special consideration is to be give to the effect that the proposed special exception use will have on the safety and welfare of the minor residents of the area. 
b.  Consideration will be given to the volume and type of vehicular traffic associated with such use, particularly its impact on residential streets. 
c.  Conformity to goals, objectives and policies of the Pembroke Park Comprehensive Plan. 
d.  The economic impact on the Town's finances due to reduction of taxable property value, increased Town services or other related economic factors. 
e.  Any additional factors or considerations which may be reasonably calculated to materially affect public health, safety and welfare; these must be explicitly stated in the resolution to approve or deny. 
f.  The Town Commission shall consider the application for special exception at a public hearing scheduled for said purpose. Notice of the public hearing shall be published in a newspaper with general circulation in the Town at least five (5) days before the public hearing. 
(Ord. No. 00-9-2, § 1, 9-22-00) 
Sec. 28-84. - Burden of proof. 
    The applicant for a special exception use permit shall have the burden of proof which shall include the burden of going forward with the evidence and the burden of persuasion on all questions of fact which are to be determined by the Town Commission. 
(Ord. No. 00-9-2, § 2, 9-22-00) 
Sec. 28-85. - Additional conditions and standards. 
    When granting approval for a special exception use, the Town Commission may attach conditions and safeguards, in addition to those prescribed herein and elsewhere in the Code of Ordinances governing such special exception use, as the Commission determines are necessary for the protection of the surrounding property, the neighborhood, and the area of the Town where such use is to be granted. 
(Ord. No. 00-9-2, § 3, 9-22-00) 
Sec. 28-85.1. - Application fees and cost deposit. 
    For applications for special exceptions there shall be a nonrefundable fee of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for processing the application and an initial deposit of six thousand dollars ($6,000.00) for nonadministrative costs as defined in section 28-72. Whenever the deposit balance is twenty (20) percent or less of the initial deposit, a supplemental deposit of two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) will be required before any further review or processing continues. The person making the initial deposit will be notified when a supplemental deposit is required. Additional supplemental deposits may be required depending upon the complexity of the review request.

(a)  In any single-family, two-family or T-1 Mobile Home Park District, off-street parking may be located in a required front yard. 
(b)  In the multiple-family and business districts, required off-street parking spaces may be located in a required front yard provided the spaces are so arranged as to preclude backing out on the traveled way of a public street, and meet the provisions contained in the parking design standard on file in the Building Department. 
(c)  In any district where a parking structure is permitted to project into a required front yard, off-street parking spaces within the structure may be located in a required front-yard. 
(d)  Driveway space for access to parking area or drive-in service facilities may be located in a required front yard.

Sec. 28-306. - Location of off street parking areas. 
(a)  Off-street parking areas shall be located on the same lot, parcel or premises as the use to be served or on a parcel of land within one hundred (100) feet of the use to be served by demonstrating that a legal, safe pedestrian travel distance will exist, and provided there is a unity of title or other acceptable written agreement between the parcel being served on the parcel on which such off-street parking is located or as otherwise approved by the Town Commission on a case-by-case basis pursuant to the provisions hereinafter. 
(b)  Where the required parking spaces are not located on the same plot with the building or use served, a unity of title, restrictive covenant, lease agreement, license, or other acceptable arrangement, in a form acceptable to the Town Attorney, shall be provided for the purpose of insuring that the required parking is provided. Any such arrangement for off-site parking must be approved by the Town Commission. The Town must be named as a third party beneficiary to any such agreement. The unity of title or other legal agreement shall be executed by the owner(s) of the properties concerned, recorded in the public records of Broward County, shall run with the land, and shall be filed concurrently with an application for any building permit which requires additional off-street parking for the property. As related to the use of railroad properties within the Town, the Town Commission may allow alternative arrangements to insure parking spaces will be available for use, because generally a unity of title would not be possible, the recording of a document affecting the rail road property may not be possible and the railroad can terminate parking agreements at will. As a condition of the Town's approval of any parking agreement, a pre-arranged alternative off-street parking plan shall be submitted with the building permit application to ensure that sufficient parking will be provided if the off-site parking is terminated. 
(c)  No off-street parking facilities for a nonresidential use shall be located on a residentially zoned parcel of land. 
(d)  Any such approved off-site parking shall be paved, marked and landscaped in accordance with appropriate Town requirements. 
(e)  If such off-site parking arrangement that is providing required parking spaces is breached, modified, terminated, or otherwise altered that results in a reduction in the number of parking spaces or change of the off-site parking, the affected property owner(s) shall notify the Town of the reduction or change within fifteen (15) days in writing, and actions shall be taken to arrange for the required off-street parking that was lost to be provided in an alternative method, which may include immediately vacating or ceasing the use of the premises or portions of the premises, until such time as sufficient for the required amount of replacement off-street parking can be provided. Any amendment to the previously approved parking plan, either temporary or permanent, must be approved in advance by the Town Planner in writing.

The striping and designation of each parking space as required herein shall not be required in stabilized grass areas permitted in section 28-304.1. 
(b)  Parking spaces may be provided in tandem, side-by-side or separately in the R-5 Residential District and T-1 Mobile Home Park District.

Sec. 28-308. - Means of access to streets. 
    Specifically, and without limitation on the foregoing and with respect to the computation of proper parking spaces for multiple-family apartment units, it is hereby ordained that a parking space shall not be recognized as a proper parking space, in computing the availability of the minimum space required by other ordinances, if such parking space is so designed or located that an operator of a motor vehicle cannot reasonably gain access to a public street from the parking space, by operating the vehicle in a forward gear only. However, with respect to living units that constitute either single-family dwellings, duplex apartment buildings, or in the T-1 Mobile Home Park District, a parking space shall be deemed to be proper parking space even though it is necessary to back into a public street from the parking space in order to gain access to the public street.

Sec. 28-311. - Entrance and exits. 
    Location and design of entrances and exits shall be based upon reasonable requirements for safety traffic regulations and standards. Landscaping, curbing or approved barriers shall be provided along lot boundaries to control entrance and exit of vehicles or pedestrians. All egress and ingress to off-street parking areas shall be so designed as to prohibit backing out of vehicles into public right-of-ways, except as provided for in section 28-308.

(Ord. No. 73-8-2, § 7(d), 8-1-73) 
Sec. 28-312. - Plan approval and permits. 
    Prior to the issuance of any building permits for any building or structure subject to this division or for structurally altering or converting any existing building or structure or for paving, grading, leveling or other permits, a suitable plan shall be submitted to the Building Official indicating the landscaping as well as the parking layout, proposed drainage on the premises, proposed lighting on the premises and all driveways extending beyond the property line into the public right-of-way. The landscaping plan shall be approved by an architect or landscape architect. The landscape plan for the parking area shall meet with the approval of the Chief Building Official who shall review the proposed parking area and its landscaping to ascertain that the plan will promote and facilitate the objectives of this division. Any deviation from the plan approved by the Building Official shall constitute a violation of this division. Plans shall be drawn to an accurate scale, and shall show the layout of the lot entrances and exits, drainage, provisions, lighting provisions, surfacing curb barriers and location and type of landscaping.

Sec. 28-314. - Nonconforming parking in the T-1 Mobile Home Park district. 
    Special circumstances exist in the T-1 Mobile Home Park District whereby a majority of the Mobile Home/RV Parks were established prior to the Town adopting the off-street parking regulations, and due to the diversity of the Mobile Home/RV Parks in the Town, site design layouts or physical constraints, some off-street parking provisions cannot be met. Therefore, the following nonconforming regulations are hereby adopted to protect older development. Mobile Home/RV parks with nonconforming sites are encouraged to upgrade off-street parking facilities as opportunities arise. 
(a)  Any existing parking arrangements in the T-1 Mobile Home Park District, including the quantity, size, or location of parking spaces, that is nonconforming due to noncompliance with the current requirements of this division may remain, provided there are no changes to the off-street or on-street parking which increases the degree of nonconformity. 
(b)  Nonconforming off-street or on-street parking arrangements, including the quantity, size, and location of parking spaces which are destroyed by fire or natural disaster or have no further economic usefulness due to age or condition, may be repaired or replaced with new off-street or on-street parking facilities, provided that the repair or replacement does not increase the degree of nonconformity.

ARTICLE V. - NONCONFORMING USES 

Sec. 28-341. - Existing buildings. 
    The lawful use of a building (except such use permitted under temporary nonconforming permits) existing at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this section was derived, may be continued although such use does not conform to the provisions of this chapter. Such use may be extended throughout the building, provided no structural alterations except those required by law or ordinance, or ordered by an authorized officer to assure the safety of the building, are made therein. No such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building. If such nonconforming building is removed, or the nonconforming use of such building is discontinued for a continuous period of ninety (90) days, every future use of such premises shall be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 63-5-1, § 4(a), 5-1-63) 
Sec. 28-342. - Lands. 
    The lawful use of land (except such use as permitted under temporary nonconforming permits) existing at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this section was derived, although such use does not conform to the provisions of this chapter, may be continued; provided, however, that no such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor shall any nonconforming use be extended to occupy a greater area of land than that occupied by such use at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this section was derived. If such nonconforming use is discontinued for a continuous period of ninety (90) days, any future use of the land shall be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. Where land is used at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this section was derived for a use excluded from the district in which the land is located, and such use is not an accessory to the use of a main building located on the same lot or grounds, such nonconforming use of land shall be discontinued and all material completely removed by its owner not later than two (2) years from the date of the adoption of the ordinance from which this section was derived. 
(Ord. No. 63-5-1, § 4(b), 5-1-63) 
Sec. 28-343. - Structural alterations. 
    If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use (except temporary nonconforming use) may be changed to a use of the same or higher classification, according to the provisions of this chapter. When a district shall hereafter be changed, any then existing nonconforming use in such changed district may be continued or changed to a use of similar or higher classification, provided all other regulations governing the new use are complied with. Whenever a nonconforming use of a building has been discontinued or changed to a higher classification, or to a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a nonconforming use of a lower classification. 
(Ord. No. 63-5-1, § 4(c), 5-1-63)

(12)  At the time of issuance of a building permit, the applicant shall enter into a contractually enforceable agreement with the Town that requires the applicant or the owner of any telecommunication tower to remove it upon abandonment. 
(13)  To the extent possible, all telecommunication towers shall be of a neutral color, designed to blend into the surrounding environment. This requirement, however, may be superseded by the requirements of other county, state or federal regulatory agency possessing jurisdiction over telecommunication towers. 
(14)  All telecommunication towers shall have the capacity to permit multiple users. At a minimum, monopole towers shall be able to accommodate two (2) users and, at a minimum, self support lattice towers shall be able to accommodate three (3) users. 
(c)  Telecommunication tower types. If a non-stealth facility is proposed, the applicant shall be required to demonstrate, in a technical manner acceptable to the Town, why a stealth facility cannot be used for the particular application. Further, the applicant shall employ its best efforts to place or screen the non-stealth facility so as not to be visible from abutting properties or public rights-of-way. 
(d)  Application procedure. 
(1)  Each application for a telecommunication tower shall comply with all Town requirements for site development plan approval. The Town may request such additional information as may be necessary to fully review and evaluate the potential impact of the proposed tower. 
(2)  A statement shall be prepared by a professional registered engineer licensed to practice in the State of Florida, which certifies the tower complies with the South Florida Building Code, latest Broward County edition, and any associated regulations, including Electronic Industry Association Telecommunications Industry Association Standard for wind load. The statement shall describe the tower's capacity, including an example of the number and type of antennas it can accommodate. No telecommunications tower shall be permitted to exceed its loading capacity. 
(3)  Each application for a telecommunication tower permit shall include a statement prepared by a radio frequency engineer, which certifies that the telecommunications tower complies with the current emission standards of the Federal Communications Commission, and will not interfere with the normal transmission or reception or radio, television and telephonic services enjoyed by adjacent residential and non-residential properties or any emergency communications regardless of point of origin. 
(4)  Prior to the issuance of a telecommunication tower permit, the applicant shall provide evidence that the telecommunication tower is in compliance with applicable Federal Aviation Administration regulations. 
(5)  Each applicant for a telecommunication tower site shall provide an inventory of the applicant's existing building mounted antennas and telecommunication towers that are either within the jurisdiction of the Town or within one (1) mile of the Town limits, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each facility or tower. 
(e)  Inspections. 
(1)  Owners of communication towers shall submit a report to the Town's building department certifying structural and electrical integrity on the following schedule: 
a.  Monopole towers. At least once every five (5) years. 
b.  Self support lattice towers. At least once every two (2) years. 
(2)  Inspections shall be conducted by an engineer licensed to practice in the State of Florida. The results of such inspections shall be provided to the Town. Based upon the results of the inspection the Town may require more frequent inspections. If there is reason to believe the structural or electrical integrity of a telecommunication tower is jeopardized, the Town, after providing notice and an opportunity to be heard to the owner of the telecommunication tower, may require repair or removal of the telecommunication tower. 
(3)  The Town may conduct periodic inspections of telecommunication towers to ensure structural and electrical integrity. 
(f)  Prohibitions. The location of a new telecommunication tower in any zoning district other than those districts specified above shall be prohibited. Notwithstanding the foregoing, telecommunication towers in existence as of the effective date of this article may be replaced with a tower of equal or less visual impact on the same parent tract and upon approval by the Town pursuant to the applicable provisions of this article. Any replacement telecommunication tower may be up to twenty (20) percent greater in height than the original telecommunication tower for the sole purpose of providing for collocation of an antenna or antennas of at least one (1) other telecommunications service provider. The replacement telecommunication tower shall not be located on the parent tract where it will decrease the distance of a non-conforming setback, the minimum distance requirement from a residential zoning district, or minimum tower separation distance requirement of the original telecommunication tower. 
(g)  Application and inspection fees. The application and inspection fees for telecommunication towers shall be established by resolution of the Town Commission. 
(Ord. No. 01-10-01, § 1, 10-10-01) 
Sec. 28-506. - Collocation. 
    To minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation and clustering of telecommunication towers, collocation of antennas on existing or new towers shall be encouraged in all zoning districts by: 
(a)  Only issuing permits to qualified shared facilities at locations where it appears there may be more demand for telecommunication towers than the property can reasonably accommodate; or giving preference to qualified shared facilities over other telecommunication towers in authorizing use at particular locations. 
(b)  For a location to become a "qualified shared facility", a telecommunication tower owner must show that: 
(1)  The proposed telecommunication tower is appropriately designed for sharing. 
(2)  The telecommunication tower owner is prepared to offer adequate space on the telecommunication tower to others on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, and to negotiate leases promptly and without undue delay. 
(c)  To satisfy the requirements of this section, the telecommunication tower owner must submit a written evaluation of the structural capacity of the telecommunication tower. 
(d)  The requirements of this section will be deemed to have been met if the telecommunication tower owner certifies to the Town that it will offer space to other unaffiliated entities on commercially, reasonable terms, and to negotiate leases promptly and without undue delay. A condition of any permit for a qualified shared facility shall be that the permit shall be terminated, and the telecommunication tower removed, if the Town finds the telecommunication tower owner is not complying with its obligation sunder this section. 
(e)  Collocation of antennas by more than one (1) provider on existing or new telecommunication towers shall take precedence over the construction of new single-use telecommunication towers. Accordingly, each application for a telecommunication tower shall include the following: 
(1)  A written evaluation of the feasibility of sharing a telecommunication tower. The evaluation shall analyze one (1) or more of the following factors: 
a.  Structural capacity of the telecommunication tower or towers; 
b.  Radio frequency interference; 
c.  Geographical service area requirements; 
d.  Mechanical or electrical incompatibility; 
e.  Inability or ability to locate equipment on the telecommunication tower or telecommunication towers; 
f.  Availability of telecommunication towers for collocation; 
g.  Any restrictions or limitations of the Federal Communications Commission that would preclude the shared use of the telecommunication tower; 
h.  Additional information requested by the Town. 
(2)  The Town may deny an application if an available collocation is feasible and the application is not for such collocation. 
(f)  The Town shall retain a list of all telecommunication towers that are qualified shared facilities located within the Town, and will provide a copy of the list to all potential applicants. 
(Ord. No. 01-10-01, § 1, 10-10-01) 
Sec. 28-507. - Abandonment. 
(a)  In the event all legally approved use of any antenna or telecommunication tower has been discontinued for a period of one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days, the antenna or telecommunication tower shall be deemed to be abandoned. Determination of the date of abandonment shall be made by the Public Works Director who shall have the right to request documentation and affidavits from the antenna or telecommunication tower owner regarding the issue of usage. 
(b)  At such time as the Public Works Director reasonably determines that an antenna or telecommunication tower is abandoned, the Public Works Director shall provide the antenna or telecommunication tower owner with written notice of an abandonment determination by certified mail. Failure or refusal by the owner to respond to the notice within sixty (60) days of receipt of such notice shall constitute prima facie evidence that the antenna or telecommunication tower has been abandoned. 
(c)  If the owner of the antenna or telecommunication tower fails to demonstrate that the antenna or telecommunication tower is not abandoned, the antenna or telecommunication tower shall be considered abandoned and the owner of the antenna or telecommunication tower shall have an additional one hundred twenty (120) days from the end of the initial sixty (60) days notice period within which to: (i) reactivate the use of the antenna or telecommunication tower or transfer the antenna or telecommunication tower to another owner who makes actual use of the antenna or telecommunication tower within the one hundred twenty (120) day period, or (ii) dismantle and remove the antenna or telecommunication tower. If one hundred twenty-one (121) days from the date of abandonment, the telecommunication tower has not been reactivated and the telecommunication tower has not been dismantled and removed, the owner shall be in violation of this section.

ORDINANCE NO. 06-09-01 
AN ORDINANCE OF THE TOWN OF PEMBROKE PARK, FLORIDA RELATING TO UTILITY FRANCHISES; PROVIDING FOR FRANCHISE AGREEMENT WITH FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY, ITS SUCCESSORS AND/OR ASSIGNS, FOR ELECTRIC UTILITY FRANCHISE; PROVIDING FOR PROVISIONS AND CONDITIONS RELATING THERETO; PROVIDING FOR MONTHLY PAYMENTS TO THE TOWN OF PEMBROKE PARK; REPEALING CONFLICTING ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTIONS AND PROVIDING AN EFFECTIVE DATE. 
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COMMISSION OF THE TOWN OF PEMBROKE PARK, FLORIDA: 
    Section 1. There is hereby granted to Florida Power & Light Company, its successors and assigns (hereinafter called the "Grantee"), for the period of 30 years from the effective date hereof, the nonexclusive right, privilege and franchise (hereinafter called "franchise") to construct, operate and maintain in, under, upon, along, over and across the present and future roads, streets, alleys, bridges, easements, rights-of-way and other public places (hereinafter called "public rights-of-way") throughout all of the incorporated areas, as such incorporated areas may be constituted from time to time, of the Town of Pembroke Park, Florida, and its successors (hereinafter called the "Grantor"), in accordance with the Grantee's customary practice with respect to construction and maintenance, electric light and power facilities, including, without limitation, conduits, poles, wires, transmission and distribution lines, and all other facilities installed in conjunction with or ancillary to all of the Grantee's operations (hereinafter called "facilities"), for the purpose of supplying electricity and other services to the Grantor and its successors, the inhabitants thereof, and persons beyond the limits thereof. 
    Section 2. The facilities of the Grantee shall be installed, located or relocated so as to not unreasonably interfere with traffic over the public rights-of-way or with reasonable egress from and ingress to abutting property. To avoid conflicts with traffic, the location or relocation of all facilities shall be made as representatives of the Grantor may prescribe in accordance with the Grantor's reasonable rules and regulations with reference to the placing and maintaining in, under, upon, along, over and across said public rights-of-way; provided, however, that such rules or regulations (a) shall not prohibit the exercise of the Grantee's right to use said public rights-of-way for reasons other than unreasonable interference with motor vehicular traffic, (b) shall not unreasonably interfere with the Grantee's ability to furnish reasonably sufficient, adequate and efficient electric service to all of its customers, and (c) shall not require the relocation of any of the Grantee's facilities installed before or after the effective date hereof in public rights-of-way unless or until widening or otherwise changing the configuration of the paved portion of any public right-of-way used by motor vehicles causes such installed facilities to unreasonably interfere with motor vehicular traffic. Such rules and regulations shall recognize that above-grade facilities of the Grantee installed after the effective date hereof should be installed near the outer boundaries of the public rights-of-way to the extent possible. When any portion of a public right-of-way is excavated by the Grantee in the location or relocation of any of its facilities, the portion of the public rights-of-way so excavated shall within a reasonable time be replaced by the Grantee at its expense and in as good condition as it was at the time of such excavation. The Grantor shall not be liable to the Grantee for any cost or expense in connection with any relocation of the Grantee's facilities required under subsection (c) of this Section, except, however, the Grantee shall be entitled to reimbursement of its costs from others and as may be provided by law. 
    Section 3. The Grantor shall in no way be liable or responsible for any accident or damage that may occur in the construction, operation or maintenance by the Grantee of its facilities hereunder, and the acceptance of this ordinance shall be deemed an agreement on the part of the Grantee to indemnify the Grantor and hold it harmless against any and all liability, loss, cost, damage or expense which may accrue to the Grantor by reason of the negligence, default or misconduct of the Grantee in the construction, operation or maintenance of its facilities hereunder. 
    Section 4. All rates and rules and regulations established by the Grantee from time to time shall be subject to such regulation as may be provided by law. 
    Section 5. As a consideration for this franchise, the Grantee shall pay to the Grantor, commencing 90 days after the effective date hereof, and each month thereafter for the remainder of the term of this franchise, an amount which added to the amount of all licenses, excises, fees, charges and other impositions of any kind whatsoever (except ad valorem property taxes and non-ad valorem tax assessments on property) levied or imposed by the Grantor against the Grantee's property, business or operations and those of its subsidiaries during the Grantee's monthly billing period ending 60 days prior to each such payment will equal 5.9 percent of the Grantee's billed revenues, less actual write-offs, from the sale of electrical energy to residential, commercial and industrial customers (as such customers are defined by FPL's tariff) within the incorporated areas of the Grantor for the monthly billing period ending 60 days prior to each such payment, and in no event shall payment for the rights and privileges granted herein exceed 5.9 percent of such revenues for any monthly billing period of the Grantee. 
The Grantor understands and agrees that such revenues as described in the preceding paragraph are limited, as in the existing franchise Ordinance No. 78-3-1, to the precise revenues described therein, and that such revenues do not include, by way of example and not limitation: (a) revenues from the sale of electrical energy for Public Street and Highway Lighting (service for lighting public ways and areas); (b) revenues from Other Sales to Public Authorities (service with eligibility restricted to governmental entities); (c) revenues from Sales to Railroads and Railways (service supplied for propulsion of electric transit vehicles); (d) revenues from Sales for Resale (service to other utilities for resale purposes); (e) franchise fees; (f) Late Payment Charges; (g) Field Collection Charges; (h) other service charges. 
    Section 6. If during the term of this franchise the Grantee enters into a franchise agreement with any other municipality located in Broward County, Florida, the population of which is equal to or less than that of the Grantor, the terms of which provide for the payment of franchise fees by the Grantee at a rate greater than 6.0% of the Grantee's residential, commercial and industrial revenues (as such customers are defined by FPL's tariff), under the same terms and conditions as specified in Section 5 hereof, the Grantee, upon written request of the Grantor, shall negotiate and enter into a new franchise agreement with the Grantor in which the percentage to be used in calculating monthly payments under Section 5 hereof shall be no greater than that percentage which the Grantee has agreed to use as a basis for the calculation of payments to the other Broward County municipality, provided, however, that such new franchise agreement shall include additional benefits to the Grantee, in addition to all benefits provided herein, at least equal to those provided by its franchise agreement with the other Broward County municipality. Subject to all limitations, terms and conditions specified in the preceding sentence, the Grantor shall have the sole discretion to determine the percentage to be used in calculating monthly payments, and the Grantee shall have the sole discretion to determine those benefits to which it would be entitled, under any such new franchise agreement. 
    Section 7. As a further consideration, during the term of this franchise or any extension thereof, the Grantor agrees: (a) not to engage in the distribution and/or sale, in competition with the Grantee, of electric capacity and/or electric energy to any ultimate consumer of electric utility service (herein called a "retail customer") or to any electrical distribution system established solely to serve any retail customer formerly served by the Grantee, (b) not to participate in any proceeding or contractual arrangement, the purpose or terms of which would be to obligate the Grantee to transmit and/or distribute, electric capacity and/or electric energy from any third party(ies) to any other retail customer's facility(ies), and (c) not to seek to have the Grantee transmit and/or distribute electric capacity and/or electric energy generated by or on behalf of the Grantor at one location to the Grantor's facility(ies) at any other location(s). Nothing specified herein shall prohibit the Grantor from engaging with other utilities or persons in wholesale transactions which are subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act. 
Nothing herein shall prohibit the Grantor, if permitted by law, (i) from purchasing electric capacity and/or electric energy from any other person, or (ii) from seeking to have the Grantee transmit and/or distribute to any facility(ies) of the Grantor electric capacity and/or electric energy purchased by the Grantor from any other person; provided, however, that before the Grantor elects to purchase electric capacity and/or electric energy from any other person, the Grantor shall notify the Grantee. Such notice shall include a summary of the specific rates, terms and conditions which have been offered by the other person and identify the Grantor's facilities to be served under the offer. The Grantee shall thereafter have 90 days to evaluate the offer and, if the Grantee offers rates, terms and conditions which are equal to or better than those offered by the other person, the Grantor shall be obligated to continue to purchase from the Grantee electric capacity and/or electric energy to serve the previously-identified facilities of the Grantor for a term no shorter than that offered by the other person. If the Grantee does not agree to rates, terms and conditions which equal or better the other person's offer, all of the terms and conditions of this franchise shall remain in effect. 
    Section 8. If the Grantor grants a right, privilege or franchise to any other person or otherwise enables any other such person to construct, operate or maintain electric light and power facilities within any part of the incorporated areas of the Grantor in which the Grantee may lawfully serve or compete on terms and conditions which the Grantee determines are more favorable than the terms and conditions contained herein, the Grantee may at any time thereafter terminate this franchise if such terms and conditions are not remedied within the time period provided hereafter. The Grantee shall give the Grantor at least 60 days advance written notice of its intent to terminate. Such notice shall, without prejudice to any of the rights reserved for the Grantee herein, advise the Grantor of such terms and conditions that it considers more favorable. The Grantor shall then have 60 days in which to correct or otherwise remedy the terms and conditions complained of by the Grantee. If the Grantee determines that such terms or conditions are not remedied by the Grantor within said time period, the Grantee may terminate this franchise agreement by delivering written notice to the Grantor's Clerk and termination shall be effective on the date of delivery of such notice. 
    Section 9. If as a direct or indirect consequence of any legislative, regulatory or other action by the United States of America or the State of Florida (or any department, agency, authority, instrumentality or political subdivision of either of them) any person is permitted to provide electric service within the incorporated areas of the Grantor to a customer then being served by the Grantee, or to any new applicant for electric service within any part of the incorporated areas of the Grantor in which the Grantee may lawfully serve, and the Grantee determines that its obligations hereunder, or otherwise resulting from this franchise in respect to rates and service, place it at a competitive disadvantage with respect to such other person, the Grantee may, at any time after the taking of such action, terminate this franchise if such competitive disadvantage is not remedied within the time period provided hereafter. The Grantee shall give the Grantor at least 90 days advance written notice of its intent to terminate. Such notice shall, without prejudice to any of the rights reserved for the Grantee herein, advise the Grantor of the consequences of such action which resulted in the competitive disadvantage. The Grantor shall then have 90 days in which to correct or otherwise remedy the competitive disadvantage. If such competitive disadvantage is not remedied by the Grantor within said time period, the Grantee may terminate this franchise agreement by delivering written notice to the Grantor's Clerk and termination shall take effect on the date of delivery of such notice. 
    Section 10. Failure on the part of the Grantee to comply in any substantial respect with any of the provisions of this franchise shall be grounds for forfeiture, but no such forfeiture shall take effect if the reasonableness or propriety thereof is protested by the Grantee until there is final determination (after the expiration or exhaustion of all rights of appeal) by a court of competent jurisdiction that the Grantee has failed to comply in a substantial respect with any of the provisions of this franchise, and the Grantee shall have six months after such final determination to make good the default before a forfeiture shall result with the right of the Grantor at its discretion to grant such additional time to the Grantee for compliance as necessities in the case require. 
    Section 11. Failure on the part of the Grantor to comply in substantial respect with any of the provisions of this ordinance, including but not limited to: (a) denying the Grantee use of public rights-of-way for reasons other than unreasonable interfere with motor vehicular traffic; (b) imposing conditions for use of public rights-of-way contrary to Florida law or the terms and conditions of this franchise; (c) unreasonable delay in issuing the Grantee a use permit, if any, to construct its facilities in public rights-of-way, shall constitute breach of this franchise and entitle the Grantee to withhold all or part of the payments provided for in Section 5 hereof until such time as a use permit is issued or a court of competent jurisdiction has reached a final determination in the matter. The Grantor recognizes and agrees that nothing in this franchise agreement constitutes or shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of the Grantee's delegated sovereign right of condemnation and that the Grantee, in its sole discretion, may exercise such right. 
    Section 12. The Grantor may, upon reasonable notice and within 90 days after each anniversary date of this franchise, at the Grantor's expense, examine the records of the Grantee relating to the calculation of the franchise payment for the year preceding such anniversary date. Such examination shall be during normal business hours at the Grantee's office where such records are maintained. Records not prepared by the Grantee in the ordinary course of business may be provided at the Grantor's expense and as the Grantor and the Grantee may agree in writing. Information identifying the Grantee's customers by name or their electric consumption shall not be taken from the Grantee's premises. Such audit shall be impartial and all audit findings, whether they decrease or increase payment to the Grantor, shall be reported to the Grantee. The Grantor's right to examine the records of the Grantee in accordance with this Section shall not be conducted by any third party employed by the Grantor whose fee, in whole or part, for conducting such audit is contingent on findings of the audit. 
Grantor waives, settles and bars all claims relating in any way to the amounts paid by the Grantee under the Current Franchise Agreement embodied in Ordinance No. 78-3-1. 
    Section 13. The provisions of this ordinance are interdependent upon one another, and if any of the provisions of this ordinance are found or adjudged to be invalid, illegal, void or of no effect, the entire ordinance shall be null and void and of no force or effect. 
    Section 14. As used herein "person" means an individual, a partnership, a corporation, a business trust, a joint stock company, a trust, an incorporated association, a joint venture, a governmental authority or any other entity of whatever nature. 
    Section 15. Ordinance No. 78-3-1, passed and adopted March 8, 1978 is hereby repealed. 
    Section 16. That all and all other ordinances and parts of ordinances and all resolutions and parts of resolutions in conflict herewith, be and the same are hereby repealed to the extent of such conflict. 
    Section 17. As a condition precedent to the taking effect of this ordinance, the Grantee shall file its acceptance hereof with the Grantor's Clerk within 30 days of adoption of this ordinance. The effective date of this ordinance shall be the date upon which the Grantee files such acceptance.
