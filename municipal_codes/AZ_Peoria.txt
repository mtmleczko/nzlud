PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Peoria, Arizona. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1992 Code, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

(Index or Indexes) 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments

Sec. 12-372. - Proof of exemption: Sale for resale; sale, rental, lease, or license of rental equipment. 
    A claim of purchase for resale or of purchase, rental, lease, or license for rent, lease, or license is valid only if the evidence is sufficient to persuade a reasonably prudent businessman that the particular item is being acquired for resale or for rental, lease, or license in the ordinary course of business. The fact that the acquiring person possesses a Privilege License number, and makes a verbal claim of "sale for resale or lease" or "lease for re-lease" does not meet this burden and is insufficient to justify an exemption. The "reasonable evidence" must be evidence which exists objectively, and not merely in the mind of the vendor, that the property being acquired is normally sold, rented, leased, or licensed by the acquiring person in the ordinary course of business. Failure to obtain such reasonable evidence at the time of the transaction will be a basis for disallowance of any claimed deduction on returns filed for such transactions.

(a)  Returns.

(b)  Payment. If payment is made in any form other than United States legal tender, the tax obligation shall not be satisfied until the payment has been honored in funds. 
(c)  Requirement of Security. If a taxpayer has remitted payment in the form of a check or other form of draw upon a bank or third party and such remittance has not been honored in funds, the Tax Collector may demand security for future payments.

Secs. 12-521-12-529. - Reserved. 
Sec. 12-530. - When tax due; when delinquent; verification of return; extensions. 
(a)  Except as provided elsewhere in this Section, the taxes shall be due and payable monthly on or before the twentieth (20th) day of the month next succeeding the month in which the tax accrues. 
(1)  Quarterly returns. The Tax Collector may authorize a taxpayer whose reporting history indicates an estimated annual City Privilege and Use Tax liability on taxable gross income in excess of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) but less than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00) to file returns on a calendar-quarterly basis. The taxes for each calendar quarter shall be due and payable on or before the twentieth (20th) day of the month next succeeding the end of each calendar quarter. 
(2)  Annual returns. The Tax Collector may authorize a taxpayer whose reporting history indicates an estimated annual City Privilege and Use Tax liability on taxable gross income of not more than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) to file returns for such taxes on a calendar-annual basis. The taxes for each calendar year shall be due and payable on or before the twentieth (20th) day of January of the following year. 
(b)  Special Requirements of taxpayers filing quarterly or annual returns. No taxpayer may report on a quarterly or annual basis until he has established, to the Tax Collector's satisfaction, six (6) months reporting history. It is the taxpayer's responsibility to notify the Tax Collector and increase his reporting frequency (to quarterly or monthly as applicable) when his taxable income or tax due exceeds the maximum limits for his current reporting frequency. Failure to do so may be deemed negligence or evasion, and penalties may apply. Failure to file returns timely, without good cause shown to the satisfaction of the Tax Collector, is sufficient cause for the Tax Collector to deny future filings by the taxpayer on a quarterly or annual basis. 
(c)  Delinquency Date. Except as provided in subsection (d) below, all returns and remittances received within the Tax Collector's office on or before the last business day of the month when due shall be regarded as timely filed. The start of business of the first business day following the month when due shall be the delinquency date. It shall be the taxpayer's responsibility to cause his return and remittance to be timely received. Mailing the return or remittance on or before the due date or delinquency date does not relieve the taxpayer of the responsibility of causing his return or remittance to be received by the last business day of the month when due. 
(d)  Jeopardy reporting. If the Tax Collector determines that the collection of any tax due to the City is in jeopardy, the Tax Collector may direct the taxpayer to file his return and remit the tax on a weekly, daily, or transaction-by-transaction basis. Such return and remittance shall be due upon the date fixed by the Tax Collector, and the "delinquency date" shall be the following day. 
(e)  Extensions. The Tax Collector may extend the time for filing a return, for good cause shown, and only when requested in writing and received by the Tax Collector prior to the tax due date. However, the time for filing such return shall not be extended beyond the last business day of the month next succeeding the due date of such return. In such cases, only the penalties for late filing and late payment may be waived by the Tax Collector for filing and payment within the extension period. Notwithstanding the granting of an extension, the interest payable for late payment of taxes shall be paid for the period commencing upon the original delinquency date and ending on the date the tax is paid. The interest may not be waived by the Tax Collector.

Sec. 12-540. - Interest and civil penalties. 
(a)  Any taxpayer who failed to pay any of the taxes imposed by this Chapter which were due or found to be due before the delinquency date shall be subject to and shall pay interest upon such tax until paid. From and after October 1, 2005, the interest rate shall be determined in the same manner and at the same times as prescribed by section 6621 of the United States Internal Revenue Code and compounded annually under the method described in Subsection (1) below. The rate of interest for both overpayments and underpayments for all taxpayers is the federal short-term rate, determined pursuant to Section 6621(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, plus three percentage points. The interest rate prior to October 1, 2005 shall be one percent (1%) per month. Said interest may be neither waived by the Tax Collector nor abated by the Hearing Officer except as it might relate to a tax abated as provided by Section 12-570. 
(1)  On January 1 of each year any interest outstanding as of that date that was accrued from and after October 1, 2005 is thereafter considered a part of the principal amount of the tax and accrues interest pursuant to this Section. 
(2)  Interest accrued prior to October 1, 2005 shall not be added to the principal. 
(b)  In addition to interest assessed under subsection (a) above, any taxpayer who failed to pay any of the taxes imposed by this Chapter which were due or found to be due before the delinquency date shall be subject to and shall pay any or all of the following civil penalties, in addition to any other penalties prescribed by this Chapter: 
(1)  A taxpayer who fails to timely file a return for a tax imposed by this Chapter shall pay a penalty of five percent (5%) of the tax for each month or fraction of a month elapsing between the delinquency date of the return and the date on which it is filed, unless the taxpayer shows that the failure to timely file is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. This penalty shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the tax due. 
(2)  A taxpayer who fails to pay the tax within the time prescribed shall pay a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the unpaid tax, unless the taxpayer shows that the failure to timely pay is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. If the taxpayer is also subject to a penalty under subsection (b)(1) above for the same tax period, the total penalties under subsection (b)(1) and this subsection shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the tax due. 
(3)  A taxpayer who fails or refuses to file a return within thirty (30) days of having received a written notice and demand from the Tax Collector shall pay a penalty of twenty-five percent (25%) of the tax, unless the taxpayer shows that the failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect or the tax collector agrees to a longer time period. 
(4)  If the cause of a tax deficiency is determined by the Tax Collector to be due to negligence, but without regard for intent to defraud, the taxpayer shall pay a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount of deficiency. If the taxpayer is also subject to a penalty under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2) above for the same tax period, the total penalties imposed under subsection (b)(1), (b)(2) and this subsection shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the tax due. 
(5)  If the cause of a tax deficiency is determined by the Tax Collector to be due to civil fraud or evasion of the tax, the taxpayer shall pay a penalty of fifty percent (50%) of the amount of deficiency. 
(c)  Penalties and interest imposed by this Section are due and payable upon notice by the Tax Collector. 
(d)  If, following an audit, penalties attributable to the audit period are to be assessed pursuant to subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2) above, the Tax Collector, before assessing such penalties, must take into consideration any information or explanations provided by the taxpayer as to why the return was not timely filed and/or the tax was not timely paid. If such information and/or explanations are provided by the taxpayer, and the Tax Collector nevertheless decides to assess penalties pursuant to subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2) above, then, at the time the penalties are assessed, the Tax Collector must provide the taxpayer with a detailed written explanation of the basis for the Tax Collector's determination that the information and/or explanations provided by the taxpayer did not constitute reasonable cause. 
(e)  The assessment of the penalties prescribed by subsections (b)(3) through (b)(5) above must be approved on a case-by-case basis by the Tax Collector prior to such assessment. In addition, any assessment which includes penalties based upon subsection (b)(3), (b)(4), or (b)(5) above must be accompanied by a statement signed by the Tax Collector setting forth in detail the basis for the Tax Collector's determination that the penalties are warranted under the circumstances. 
(f)  The Tax Collector shall waive or adjust penalties imposed by subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) above upon a finding that: 
(1)  In the past, the taxpayer has consistently filed and paid the taxes imposed by this Chapter in a timely manner; or 
(2)  The amount of the penalty is greatly disproportionate to the amount of the tax; or 
(3)  The failure of a taxpayer to file a return and/or pay any tax by the delinquency date was caused by any of the following circumstances which must occur prior to the delinquency date of the return or payment in question: 
(A)  The return was timely filed but was inadvertently forwarded to another taxing jurisdiction. 
(B)  Erroneous or insufficient information was furnished the taxpayer by the Tax Collector or his employee or agent. 
(C)  Death or serious illness of the taxpayer, member of his immediate family, or the preparer of the reports immediately prior to the due date. 
(D)  Unavoidable absence of the taxpayer immediately prior to the due date. 
(E)  Destruction, by fire or other casualty, of the taxpayer's place of business or records. 
(F)  Prior to the due date, the taxpayer made application for proper forms which could not be furnished in sufficient time to permit a timely filing. 
(G)  The taxpayer was in the process of pursuing an active protest of the tax in question in another taxing jurisdiction at the time the tax and/or return was due. 
(H)  The taxpayer establishes through competent evidence that the taxpayer contacted a tax advisor who is competent on the specific tax matter and, after furnishing necessary and relevant information, the taxpayer was incorrectly advised that no tax was owed and/or the filing of a return was not required. 
(I)  The taxpayer has never been audited by a city for the tax or on the issue in question and relied, in good faith, on a State exemption or interpretation. 
(J)  The taxpayer can provide some public record (court case, report in a periodical, professional journal or publication, etc.) stating that the transaction is not subject to tax. 
(K)  The Arizona Department of Revenue, based upon the same facts and circumstances, abated penalties for the same filing period. 
A taxpayer may also request a waiver or adjustment of penalty for a reason thought to be equally substantive to those reasons itemized above. All requests for waiver or adjustment of penalty must be in writing and shall contain all pertinent facts and other reliable and substantive evidence to support the request. In all cases, the burden of proof is upon the taxpayer. 
(g)  No request for waiver of penalty under subsection (f) above may be granted unless written request for waiver is received by the Tax Collector within forty-five (45) days following the imposition of penalty. Any taxpayer aggrieved by the refusal to grant a waiver under subsection (f) above may appeal under the provisions of Section 12-570 provided that a petition of appeal or request for an extension is submitted to the Tax Collector within forty-five (45) days of the taxpayer's receipt of notice by the City that waiver has been denied. 
(h)  For the purpose of this Section, "reasonable cause" shall mean that the taxpayer exercised ordinary business care and prudence, i.e., had a reasonable basis for believing that the tax did not apply to the business activity or the storage or use of the taxpayer's tangible personal property in this City. 
(i)  For the purpose of this Section, "negligence" shall be characterized chiefly by inadvertence, thoughtlessness, inattention, or the like, rather than an "honest mistake". Examples of negligence include: 
(1)  The taxpayer's failure to maintain records in accordance with Article III of this Chapter; 
(2)  Repeated failures to timely file returns; or 
(3)  Gross ignorance of the law.

(a)  Notwithstanding Section 12-540(a), no interest or penalty may be assessed on an amount assessed as a deficiency if either: 
(1)  The deficiency assessed is directly attributable to erroneous written advice furnished to the taxpayer by an employee of the City acting in an official capacity in response to a specific request from the taxpayer and not from the taxpayer's failure to provide adequate or accurate information. 
(2)  All of the following are true: 
(A)  A tax return form prepared by the Tax Collector contains a statement that, if followed by a taxpayer, would cause the taxpayer to misapply this Chapter. 
(B)  The taxpayer reasonably relies on the statement.

(b)  Each employee of the Tax Collector, at the time any oral advice is given to any person, shall inform the person that the Tax Collector is not bound by such oral advice.

The existence of another reasonable basis of estimation does not, in any way, invalidate the Tax Collector's estimate. It is the responsibility of the taxpayer to prove that the Tax Collector's estimate is not reasonable and correct, by providing sufficient documentation of the type and form required by this Chapter or satisfactory to the Tax Collector.

(a)  If the Tax Collector determines that noncompliance with tax obligations results from extensive misunderstanding or misapplication of provisions of this Chapter it may enter into closing agreements with those taxpayers under the following terms and conditions: 
(1)  Extensive misunderstanding or misapplication of the tax laws occurs if the Tax Collector determines that more than sixty percent (60%) of the persons in the affected class have failed to properly account for their taxes owing to the same misunderstanding or misapplication of the tax laws. 
(2)  The Tax Collector shall publicly declare the nature of the possible misapplication and the proposed definition of the class of affected taxpayers and shall conduct a public hearing to hear testimony regarding the extent of the misapplication and the definition of the affected class. 
(3)  If, after the public hearing, the Tax Collector determines that a class of affected taxpayers has failed to comply with their tax obligations because of extensive misunderstanding or misapplication of the tax laws it shall issue a tax ruling announcing that finding and publish the ruling in a newspaper of general circulation in the City and through the next two model city tax code updates. 
(4)  A closing agreement under this Section may abate some or all of the penalties, interest and tax that taxpayers have failed to remit, or the agreement may provide for the prospective treatment of the matter as to the class of affected taxpayers. All taxpayers in the class shall be offered the opportunity to enter into a similar agreement for the same tax periods. 
(5)  Taxpayers in the affected class who have properly accounted for their tax obligations for these tax periods shall be offered the opportunity to enter into an equivalent closing agreement providing for a pro rata credit or refund of their taxes previously paid. 
(6)  The closing agreement shall require the taxpayers to properly account for and pay such taxes in the future. If a taxpayer fails to adhere to such a requirement, the closing agreement is voidable by the Tax Collector and he may assess the taxpayer for the delinquent taxes. The Tax Collector may issue such a proposed assessment within six months after the date that he declares that closing agreement void or within the period prescribed by Section 12-550 of this Chapter. 
(b)  Before entering into closing agreements pursuant to this Section, the Tax Collector shall secure such approval as required by charter, ordinance or administrative regulation. 
(c)  After a closing agreement has been signed pursuant to this Section, it is final and conclusive except on a showing of fraud, malfeasance or misrepresentation of a material fact.

(c)  When no return filed; fraudulent return.

Sec. 12-560. - Erroneous payment of tax; credits and refunds; limitations. 
(a)  The Tax Collector may authorize either credits or payments of refunds for any taxes, penalties or interest paid in excess of the amount actually due. Any credit authorized by the Tax Collector shall be canceled from the accounts of the City if no timely filed request for credit or refund is made by the claimant claiming same within one (1) year following the date of determination and notice by the Tax Collector of the excess payment. For purposes of this Section, "Claimant" means a taxpayer that has paid a tax imposed under this Article and has submitted a credit or refund claim under this Section. Except where the taxpayer has granted a customer a power of attorney to pursue a credit or refund claim on the taxpayer's behalf, "claimant" does not include any customer of such taxpayer, whether or not the claimant collected the tax from customers by separately stated itemization. 
(b)  No credit shall be allowed or refund paid except under one of the following conditions: 
(1)  As provided in Section 12-565. 
(2)  Upon examination of filed returns for any period not excluded by Section 12-550, and not to exceed the tax, penalty, or interest actually paid with such returns. 
(3)  Upon audit or other examination of the books and records of the taxpayer, but only for periods as provided in Section 12-550. In the case of an examination performed at the taxpayer's request, credit shall be allowed or refund paid only for any excess taxes, penalties, or interest actually paid within the limitation period provided in Section 12-550, such period to be calculated from the date of receipt of the taxpayer's request by the Tax Collector. Requests by taxpayers for audits to authorize credits shall be honored unless, in the opinion of the Tax Collector, the taxpayer has made excessive requests for audits. 
(4)  Upon the claimant's submission of a written claim for credit or refund of any taxes, penalties, or interest paid to the City by the claimant. 
(c)  A credit or refund submitted by a claimant pursuant to subsection (b)(4) of this Section must identify: 
(1)  The name, address and city tax identification number of the taxpayer; and 
(2)  The dollar amount of the credit or refund requested; and 
(3)  The specific tax period involved; and

(d)  When a written claim for credit or refund is submitted pursuant to Subsection (b)(4) of this Section, no credit shall be allowed or refund paid except for those taxes, penalties, or interest paid in excess of the amount due within the limitation period provided Section 12-550. The credit or refund limitation period shall be calculated from the date the tax collector receives the claimant's written claim meeting the requirements of Subsection (c) of this Section. 
(e)  The following additional requirements apply to the Tax Collector and the claimant for claims for credit or refund submitted pursuant to Subsection (b)(4) of this Section: 
(1)  The tax collector shall notify the claimant that the claim for credit or refund has been received and shall indicate whether the claim meets the requirements of Subsection (c) of this Section. If the claim does not meet the requirements of Subsection (c) of this Section, the tax collector shall identify the deficiency in writing. Any claim that does not meet the requirements of Subsection (c) of this Section shall not secure the limitation period pursuant to Section 12-550. 
(2)  The tax collector may request, in writing, additional information or documentation from the claimant to support the requested credit or refund. Such information or documentation must be reasonably related to the claim and required to be maintained under this chapter in the normal course of business. 
(A)  The claimant may request in writing one or more extensions to supply the requested information or documentation. The tax collector may reject an extension request only by denying the claim in whole or in part, subject to appeal by the claimant pursuant to Section 12-570. 
(B)  A claimant aggrieved by a request for information or documentation under this Subsection may file an appeal in the manner provided for in Section 12-570 regarding the scope of the request for information or documentation. Such petition must be filed no later than the last day by which requested information or documentation must be provided to the tax collector, including any extensions. The decision of the hearing officer regarding a request for information or documentation may not be appealed by either party until the claim has been approved or denied, in whole or in part, under Subsection (h) of this Section or through Subsections (e)(3) or (e)(4) of this Section. A claimant shall not be barred from raising the issue of the reasonableness of the tax collector's information or documentation request in an appeal filed under Subsection (h) of this Section or through Subsections (e)(3) or (e)(4) of this Section through a lack of filing a petition under this subsection. 
(3)  If the tax collector fails to request additional information or documentation pursuant to this Section and fails to issue a determination on any claim for credit or refund within six (6) months after the claim is filed, the claimant may consider the claim denied and may file an appeal pursuant to Section 12-570. 
(4)  If the tax collector fails to issue a determination within six (6) months of receiving all requested additional information or documentation, the claimant may consider the claim for credit or refund denied and may file an appeal pursuant to Section 12-570. 
(5)  The burden of proof to show that a notice, request, determination, or other communication was received by the claimant in this Section is on the tax collector, and will be satisfied by receipt of notice. The burden of proof to show that a claim or additional information or documentation was received by the tax collector is on the claimant and will be satisfied by receipt of notice. 
(f)  Interest shall be allowed on the overpayment of tax for any credit or refund authorized pursuant to this Section at the rate and in the manner set forth in Section 12-540(a). Interest shall be calculated from the date the tax collector receives the claimant's written claim meeting the requirements of subsection (c) of this section. 
(g)  The tax collector shall give the claimant a written notice of determination for a claim made under Subsection (b) of this Section. If the determination is a denial of a claim, in whole or in part, the determination must state that the claim for credit or refund has been denied in whole or in part, with the reason for denial, and must include the claimant's rights of appeal pursuant to Section 12-570. 
(h)  A determination by the tax collector under this Section, whether an approval of a claim or a denial of a claim, in whole or in part, shall become final forty-five (45) days from the date of receipt of the notice by the claimant, unless an appeal is made pursuant to Section 12-570. If the claimant is the prevailing party in an appeal of a determination under this section, Section 12-578 shall apply, except that reasonable fees and other costs may be awarded either by the hearing officer or court and are not subject to the monetary limitations of Subsection 12-578(e) if the tax collector's position was not substantially justified or was brought for the purpose of harassing the claimant, frustrating the credit or refund process, or delaying the credit or refund. For the purposes of this Section, "Reasonable Fees and Other Costs" means fees and other costs that are based on prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of the furnished services, not to exceed the amounts actually paid for expert witnesses, the cost of any study, analysis, report, test, project or computer program that is found to be necessary to prepare the claimant's case, and necessary fees for attorneys or other representatives.

(b)  Administrative Review. 
(1)  Filing a Petition. Other than in the case of a jeopardy assessment, a taxpayer may contest the applicability or amount of any tax, penalty, or interest imposed upon or paid by him pursuant to this Chapter by filing a petition for a hearing or for redetermination with the Tax Collector as set forth below: 
(A)  Within forty-five (45) days of receipt by the taxpayer of notice of a determination by the Tax Collector that a tax, penalty, or interest amount is due, or that a request for refund or credit has been denied; or 
(B)  By voluntary payment of any contested amount when accompanied by a timely filed return and a petition requesting a refund of the protested portion of said payment; or 
(C)  By petition accompanying a timely filed return contesting an amount reported but not paid; or 
(D)  by petition requesting review of denial of waiver of penalty as provided in subsection 12-540(g). 
(2)  Extension to file a petition. In all cases, the taxpayer may request an extension from the Tax Collector. Such request must be in writing, state the reasons for the requested delay, and must be filed with the Tax Collector within the period allowed above for originally filing a petition. The Tax Collector shall allow a forty-five (45) day extension to file a petition, when such written request has been properly and timely made by the taxpayer. The Tax Collector may grant an additional extension and may determine the corresponding time of any such extension at his sole discretion. 
(3)  Requirements for petition. 
(A)  The petition shall be in writing and shall set forth the reasons why any correction, abatement, or refund should be granted, and the amount of reduction or refund requested. The petition may be amended at any time prior to the time the taxpayer rests his case at the hearing or such time as the Hearing Officer allows for submitting of amendments in cases of redeterminations without hearings. The Hearing Officer may require that amendments be in writing, and in that case, he shall provide a reasonable period of time to file the amendment. The Hearing Officer shall provide a reasonable period of time for the Tax Collector to review and respond to the petition and to any written amendments. 
(B)  The taxpayer, as part of the petition, may request a hearing which shall be granted by the Hearing Officer. If no request for hearing is made the petition shall be considered to be submitted for decision by the Hearing Officer on the matters contained in the petition and in any reply made by the Tax Collector. 
(C)  The provisions of this Section are exclusive, and no petition seeking any correction, abatement, or refund shall be considered unless the petition is timely and properly filed under this Section. 
(4)  Transmittal to Hearing Officer. The city shall designate a Hearing Officer, who may be other than an employee of the City. The Tax Collector, if designated to receive petitions, shall forward any petition to the Municipal Tax Hearing Office (MTHO) within twenty (20) days after receipt, accompanied by documentation as to timeliness. In cases where the Hearing Officer determines that the petition is not timely or not in proper form, he shall notify both the taxpayer and the Tax Collector; and in cases of petitions not in proper form only, the Hearing Officer shall provide the taxpayer with an extension up to forty-five (45) days to correct the petition. 
(5)  Hearings shall be conducted by a Hearing Officer and shall be continuous until the Hearing Officer closes the record. The taxpayer may be heard in person or by his authorized representative at such hearing. Hearings shall be conducted informally as to the order of proceeding and presentation of evidence. The Hearing Officer shall admit evidence over hearsay objections where the offered evidence has substantial probative value and reliability. Further, copies of records and documents prepared in the ordinary course of business may be admitted, without objection as to foundation, but subject to argument as to weight, admissibility, and authenticity. Summary accounting records may be admitted subject to satisfactory proof of the reliability of the summaries. In all cases, the decision of the Hearing Officer shall be made solely upon substantial and reliable evidence. All expenses incurred in the hearing shall be paid by the party incurring the same. 
(6)  Redeterminations upon a "petition for redetermination" shall follow the same conditions, except that no oral hearing shall be held.

(c)  Stipulations that future tax is also protested. A taxpayer may enter into a stipulation with the Tax Collector that future taxes of similar nature are also at issue in any protest or appeal. However, unless such stipulation is made, it is presumed that the protest or appeal deals solely and exclusively with the tax specifically protested and no other. When a taxpayer enters into such a stipulation with the Tax Collector that future taxes of similar nature will be included in any redetermination, hearing, or court case, it is the burden of that taxpayer to identify, segregate, and keep record of such income or protested taxable amount in his books and records in the same manner as the taxpayer is required to segregate exempt income. 
(d)  When an assessment is final. 
(1)  If a request for administrative review and petition for hearing or redetermination of an assessment made by the Tax Collector is not filed within the period required by subsection (b) above, such person shall be deemed to have waived and abandoned the right to question the amount determined to be due and any tax, interest, or penalty determined to be due shall be final as provided in subsections 12-545(a) and 12-555(f). 
(2)  The decision made by the Hearing Officer upon administrative review by hearing or redetermination shall become final thirty (30) days after the taxpayer receives the notice of refund or adjusted assessment required by subsection (b)(8) above, unless the taxpayer appeals the order or decision in the manner provided in Section 12-575.

Sec. 12-571. - Jeopardy assessments. 
(a)  If the Tax Collector believes that the collection of any assessment or deficiency of any amounts imposed by this Chapter will be jeopardized by delay, he shall deliver to the taxpayer a notice of such finding and demand immediate payment of the tax or deficiency declared to be in jeopardy, including interest, penalties, and additions. 
(b)  Jeopardy assessments are immediately due and payable, and the Tax Collector may immediately begin proceedings for collection. The taxpayer, however, may stay collection by filing, within ten (10) days after receipt of notice of jeopardy assessment, or within such additional time as the Tax Collector may allow, by bond or collateral in favor of the City in the amount Tax Collector declared to be in jeopardy in his notice. 
(c)  "Bond or Collateral", as required by this Section, 
(1)  Shall mean either: 
(A)  A bond issued in favor of the City by a surety company authorized to transact business in this State and approved by the Director of Insurance as to solvency and responsibility, or 
(B)  Collateral composed of securities or cash which are deposited with, and kept in the custody of, the Tax Collector. 
(2)  Shall be of such form that it may, at any time without notice, be applied to any tax, penalties, or interest due and payable for the purposes of this Chapter. Securities held as collateral by the Tax Collector must be of a nature that they may be sold at public or private sale without notice to the taxpayer. 
(d)  If bond or collateral is not filed within the period prescribed by subsection (b) above, the tax collector may treat the assessment as final for purposes of any collection proceedings. The taxpayer nevertheless shall be afforded the appeal rights provided in Sections 12-570 and 12-575. The filing of a petition by the taxpayer under Section 12-570, however, shall not stay the tax collector's rights to pursue any collection proceedings. 
(e)  If the taxpayer timely files sufficient bond or collateral, the jeopardy requirements are deemed satisfied, and the taxpayer may avail himself of the provisions of Section 12-570, including requests for additional time to file a petition.

(a)  Within thirty (30) days after the day on which the Tax Collector furnishes the written notice required by Section 12-571(a), the taxpayer, pursuant to Section 12-570, may request the Tax Collector to review the action taken. Within fifteen (15) days after the request for review, the Tax Collector shall determine whether both the jeopardy determination and the amount assessed are reasonable. 
(b)  Within thirty (30) days after the Tax Collector notifies the taxpayer of the determination he reached pursuant to subsection (a) above, the taxpayer may bring a civil action in the appropriate Court. If the taxpayer so requests, the City shall stipulate to an accelerated and expedited resolution of the civil action. If the Court determines that either the jeopardy determination or the amount assessed is unreasonable, the Court may order the Tax Collector to abate the assessment, to redetermine any part of the amount assessed or to take such other action as the Court finds to be appropriate. A determination made by the Court under this subsection is final except as provided in A.R.S. § 12-170.

Sec. 12-575. - Judicial review. 
(a)  A taxpayer may seek judicial review of all or any part of a Hearing Officer's decision by initiating an action against the City in the appropriate Court of this County. A taxpayer is not required to pay any tax, penalty, or interest upheld by the Hearing Officer before seeking such judicial review. 
(b)  The Tax Collector may seek judicial review of all or any part of a Hearing Officer's decision by initiating an action in the appropriate Court of this County. 
(c)  An action for judicial review can not be commenced by either the taxpayer or the Tax Collector more than thirty (30) days after receipt by the taxpayer of notice of any refund or assessment recalculated or reduced to conform to the Hearing Officer's decision, unless the time to commence such an action is extended in writing signed by both the taxpayer and the Tax Collector. Failure to bring the action within thirty (30) days or such other time as is agreed upon in writing shall constitute a waiver of any right to judicial review, except as provided in subsection (g) below. 
(d)  The Court shall hear and determine the appeal as a trial de novo; however, the Tax Collector cannot raise in the Court any grounds or basis for the assessment not asserted before the Hearing Officer. Nothing in this subsection, however, shall preclude the Tax Collector from responding to any arguments which are raised by the taxpayer in the appeal. 
(e)  The City has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence in any court proceeding regarding any factual issue relevant to ascertaining the tax liability of a taxpayer. This subsection does not abrogate any requirement of this Chapter that requires a taxpayer to substantiate an item of gross income, exclusion, exemption, deduction, or credit. This subsection applies to a factual issue if a preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that: 
(1)  The taxpayer asserts a reasonable dispute regarding the issue. 
(2)  The taxpayer has fully cooperated with the tax collector regarding the issue, including providing within a reasonable period of time, access to and inspection of all witnesses, information and documents within the taxpayer's control, as reasonably requested by the tax collector. 
(3)  The taxpayer has kept and maintained records as required by the City. 
(f)  The issuance of an adjusted or corrected assessment or notice of refund due to the taxpayer, where made by the Tax Collector pursuant to the decision of the Hearing Officer, shall not be deemed an acquiescence by the City or the Tax Collector in said decision, nor shall it constitute a bar or estoppel to the institution of an action or counterclaim by the City to recover any amounts claimed to be due to it by virtue of the original assessment. 
(g)  After the initiation of any action in the appropriate court by either party, the opposite party may file such counterclaim as would be allowed pursuant to the Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure.

(a)  A taxpayer who is a prevailing party may be reimbursed for reasonable fees and other costs related to any administrative proceeding brought by the taxpayer pursuant to Section 12-570(b). For purposes of this Section, a taxpayer is considered to be the prevailing party only if both of the following are true: 
(1)  The Tax Collector's position was not substantially justified. 
(2)  The taxpayer prevails as to the most significant issue or set of issues. 
(b)  Reimbursement under this Section may be denied if any of the following circumstances apply:

(2)  The reason that the taxpayer prevailed is due to an intervening change in the applicable law. 
(c)  The taxpayer shall present an itemization of the reasonable fees and other costs to the Taxpayer Problem Resolution Officer within thirty (30) days after receipt by the taxpayer of a notice of refund or recalculated assessment issued by the Tax Collector pursuant to Section 12-570(b)(8). The Taxpayer Problem Resolution Officer shall determine the validity of the fees and other costs within thirty (30) days after receiving the itemization. The Taxpayer Problem Resolution Officer's decision is considered a final decision. Either the taxpayer or the Tax Collector may seek judicial review of the Taxpayer Problem Resolution Officer's decision. An action for judicial review, however, shall not be commenced more than thirty (30) days after receipt of the Resolution Officer's decision. 
(d)  In the event judicial review is not sought pursuant to subsection (c) above, the City shall pay the fees and other costs awarded as provided in this Section within thirty days after demand by a person who has received an award pursuant to this Section. 
(e)  Reimbursement to a taxpayer under this Section shall not exceed twenty thousand dollars or actual monies spent, whichever is less. The reimbursable attorney or representative fees shall not exceed one hundred dollars per hour or actual monies spent, whichever is less, unless the Taxpayer Problem Resolution Officer determines that an increase in the cost of living or a special factor such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys or representatives for the proceeding involved justifies a higher fee. 
(f)  For purposes of this Section "reasonable fees and other costs" means fees and other costs that are based on prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of the furnished services, but not exceeding the amounts actually spent for expert witnesses, the cost of any study, analysis, report, test or project that is found to be necessary to prepare the party's case and necessary fees for attorneys or other representatives.

(a)  Liens. 
(1)  Any tax, penalty, or interest imposed under this Chapter which has become final, as provided in this Chapter, shall become a lien when the City perfects a notice and claim of lien setting forth the name of the taxpayer, the amount of the tax, penalty, and interest, the period or periods for which the same is due, and the date of accrual thereof, the amount of the recording costs by the county recorder in any county in which the taxpayer owns real property and the documentation and lien processing fees imposed by the City council and further, stating that the City claims a lien therefor.

After the notice and claim of lien is recorded or filed, the taxes, penalties, interest and recording costs and lien processing fees referred to above in the amounts specified therein shall be a lien on all real property of the taxpayer located in such county where recorded, and all tangible personal property of the taxpayer within the State, superior to all other liens and assessments recorded or filed subsequent to the recording or filing of the notice and claim of lien.

The Tax Collector shall respond to a request from the seller for a certificate within fifteen (15) days by either providing the certificate or a written notice stating why the certificate cannot be issued.

(1)  Identification to the customer or consumer that the listed price has "delivery included" or other similar expression is insufficient to show the delivery as a separate charge. Only the separately stated charge for the delivery shall be deemed a "delivery charge". 
(2)  Freight in. Charges for delivery from place of production or the manufacturer to the vendor either directly or through a chain of wholesalers or jobbers or other middlemen are deemed "freight -in" and are not considered delivery.

(1)  A retailer sells a customer a $100 "plug-in" appliance, with a $25 delivery and installation charge. If the retailer identifies the $25 delivery and installation charge, it is a charge for direct customer services. 
(2)  A caterer charges his customer $1,000 for the food and drink served, $300 for setup and site cleanup, and $500 for bartender and waiters. If all charges are properly identified, only the $300 for set up and cleanup is a charge for direct customer services, and the $1,500 for food and service is restauranting gross income. 
(3)  Persons engaged in engraving on wood, metal, stone, etc. or persons engaged in retouching photographs or paintings may consider such charges for labor as direct customer services. 
(4)  All charges by a photographer resulting in the sale of a photograph (sitting charges, developing, making enlargements, retouching, etc.) for services that occur prior to transfer of tangible personal property are not direct customer services. 
(5)  An equipment rental company charging $25 for delivery may consider such delivery charge as a charge for direct customer service only if such charge is properly identified. 
(6)  Even if identified, charges for labor incurred in the production of any manufactured article or of a custom-made article (jewelry, artwork, tailoring, draperies, etc.) are not included in this definition, as such labor occurs prior to the transfer of property. 
(e)  Recordkeeping requirements. 
(1)  Any person who engages in transactions involving these services must: 
(A)  Separately bill, invoice, or charge the customer for such services in a manner by which the customer or consumer may readily identify the specific dollar amount of the service charge; and 
(B)  Maintain business books and records in a manner in which the separate charge for such services can be clearly identified, to the satisfaction of the Tax Collector. 
(2)  Rendering a statement to a customer for a transaction involving such services and the transfer of tangible personal property which only indicates the total amount of the charges with words such as "services included" or "charge includes labor and parts" or a similar expression does not satisfy the requirements of this subsection.

(b)  Creative ("idea") labor and design labor that do not result in tangible personal property that will be or can be sold are deemed professional services and, if charged separately and maintained separately in the taxpayer's books and records, are not includable in gross income. 
(c)  "Professional services" shall be deemed to include those items of tangible personal property which are incidental to the services rendered, provided such tangible personal property is "inconsequential." 
(1)  Incidental transfers of tangible personal property shall be regarded as "inconsequential" if, 
(A)  The purchase price of the tangible personal property to the person rendering the professional services represents less than fifteen percent (15%) of the charge, billing, or statement rendered to the purchaser in connection with the transaction, and 
(B)  The tangible personal property transferred is not itself in a form which is subject to retail sale. 
(2)  In cases where the tangible personal property transferred is deemed inconsequential, the provider of the tangible personal property so transferred is deemed the ultimate consumer of such tangible personal property, and subject to all applicable taxes imposed by this Chapter upon such transfer. 
(d)  Examples: 
(1)  The transfer of paper embodying the result or work product of the services rendered by an attorney or certified public accountant is regarded as inconsequential to the charges for professional services. 
(2)  An appraisal report issued by an appraiser, reflecting such appraiser's efforts to appraise real estate, is regarded inconsequential. 
(3)  Use of a hair care product on a client's hair by a barber or beautician in connection with performing professional services is usually inconsequential. On the other hand, if the barber or beautician supplies the customer with a bottle of the product for the client's use thereafter and without the professional's assistance, the transfer of the bottle of hair care product is deemed not inconsequential. 
(4)  If a mortician properly segregates his professional services from other taxable activities on his bill (invoice, contract), his gross income would include only the income derived from the sale of tangible personal property (casket, cards, flowers, etc.) and rental, leasing, or licensing of real and tangible personal property. His charges for professional services (embalming, cosmetic work, etc.) would not be includable in gross income.

(b)  Any coin shall be considered to have been transferred or acquired primarily for its "Numismatic value" if the sale or acquisition price: 
(1)  Is equal to or greater than twice (2 times) the value of the metallic content of the coin as of the date of transfer or acquisition; and 
(2)  Is equal to or greater than twice (2 times) its face value, in the case of a coin which, at the time of transfer or acquisition, was legal tender or a medium of exchange of the government issuing or authorizing its issuance.

    Sales of merchandise acquired on consignment are taxable as retail sales.

However, when the principal is not deemed to be a dealer, such sales are considered to be those of the merchant and are taxable to him.

Sec. R12-465.1. - Retail sales: Repair services. 
(a)  Fair market value of parts and labor charges. The Tax Collector may examine the reporting of all transactions covered by this Section to determine if an "arms-length" price is charged for the parts and materials. The applicable tax may not be avoided by pricing a part, which ordinarily sells to the customer at $10.00, at $5.00 and including the difference as "service" or "labor". In the absence of satisfactory evidence supplied by the taxpayer as to industry or business practice, the Tax Collector may use the cost of the part or materials to the taxpayer marked up by a reasonable profit, to estimate the gross income subject to tax. 
(b)  Notwithstanding Regulation 12-350.1(e), 
(1)  In the case where the taxpayer does not normally and regularly sell items of tangible personal property apart from a repair transaction, the taxpayer may determine the sale price of the tangible personal property transferred by means of a "computed charge". The "computed charge" shall be the sum of the cost of the item of tangible personal property transferred, plus a "reasonable markup." The "reasonable markup" shall be that amount needed to achieve a representative retail price for which such items of tangible personal property are normally sold at retail by comparable businesses within the State (not under circumstances involving the combination of such sale with the providing of repair services). The taxpayer shall have the initial responsibility of determining such reasonable markup, and providing to the Tax Collector, if requested, the basis for his determination. 
(2)  In the event that there is a disagreement between the Tax Collector and the taxpayer as to the proper determination of the "computed charges", the burden shall be upon the taxpayer to satisfy the Tax Collector, the Hearing Officer in the event of a hearing, or the court in any subsequent court action involving an assessment, of the validity of the taxpayer's method of determination of such "computed charges". The determination by the Tax Collector as to the proper "computed charge" shall be considered valid, and shall be sustained unless it is proven by the taxpayer that such determination is arbitrary and unreasonable.

(b)  Transfers of tangible personal property in connection with a service, warranty, guaranty, or maintenance agreement between a vendor and a vendee shall be subject to tax under Section 12-460 only to the extent of gross income received from separately itemized charges made for the items of property transferred. 
(c)  The gross income derived from a maintenance insurance agreement, which agreement is entered into between the purchaser and any person other than the seller is not subject to tax imposed by Section 12-460. If the provider of the maintenance insurance agreement pays for tangible personal property on behalf of the insured in the performance of the agreement, such sales are subject to all applicable taxes imposed by this Chapter. 
(d)  Charges for tangible personal property provided under the terms of a warranty, maintenance, or service contract exempted under Section 12-465 are subject to tax as retail sales. 
(e)  However, gross income received by a dealer from a manufacturer for work performed under a manufacturer's warranty is not taxable under Section 12-460.

(c)  Where a retailer imposes a charge for gift wrapping and the charge includes the container, paper, and other appropriate materials, the wrapping charge shall be considered a sale. 
(d)  Charges for returnable containers, where the charges are imposed on the customer, are subject to tax at the time of the transaction. A credit may be taken for the amount of refund after such refund is made. 
(e)  The sale of labels to a purchaser who affixes them to a primary container is a sale for resale and not taxable. Directional or instructional material included with products sold are considered to be part of the product and a sale for resale. However, the sale of items such as price tags, shipping tags, and advertising matter delivered to the customer in connection with the retail sale is taxable to the retailer as a retail sale to it, and is not exempt as a sale for resale.

Sec. 19-1. - Purpose and findings. 
    The purpose of this Chapter is to establish a policy governing the management of Public Highways for the provision of Cable Services to enable the City to: 
(1)  Issue Licenses and franchises to corporations who use the Public Highways to provide Cable Services on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis, except in cases where state law forbids establishment of a License or franchise requirement; 
(2)  Manage the Public Highways in order to minimize the impact and cost to Peoria citizens of the placement of Cable System within Public Highways; 
(3)  Manage the Public Highways so as to maximize their efficient use, thereby minimizing the foreclosure of future additional uses of such Rights-of-Way; and 
(4)  Minimize congestion, inconvenience, visual impact, and other adverse effects on the City's Public Highways. 
Therefore, in this Chapter the City Council intends: 
(1)  To ensure that locally elected officials manage local Public Highways consistent with their fiduciary trust obligations; 
(2)  To ensure compliance with public health, safety and welfare measures for Public Highways; 
(3)  To encourage public-private partnerships to provide Cable Systems needed for the most cost-effective delivery of public services, including Schools, libraries, police and fire protection, as well as private services; 
(4)  To conserve the limited physical capacity of the Public Highways held in public trust by the City; and 
(5)  To assure that the City's current and ongoing costs of granting and regulating private access to and use of the Public Highways are fully paid by the persons seeking such access and causing such costs.

(m)  Awards based on Public Record. It is the intention of the City to award an Initial License solely on the basis of the public record.

(Ord. No. 2017-14 , § 10, 4-4-17) 
Sec. 19-12. - Administrative proceeding. 
(a)  In any proceeding under Section 19-11, paragraph (d)(1) the Licensee shall be afforded adequate notice and the Licensee and the Licensor shall be afforded fair opportunity for full participation, including the right to introduce evidence (including evidence related to issues raised in the proceeding under Subsection (a), require the production of evidence, and to question witnesses.

Any denial of a Proposal for Renewal License shall be based on one or more adverse findings made with respect to the factors described in Subparagraphs (a) through (d) of Subsection (d)(1), pursuant to the record of the proceeding under Subsection (d). The City may not base a denial of a Renewal License on a failure to substantially comply with the material terms of the License under Subsection (d)(1)a. or on events considered under Subsection (d)(1)b. unless the City has provided the Licensee with notice and the opportunity to cure, or in any case in which it is documented that the City has waived its right to object, or has effectively acquiesced.

(Ord. No. 2017-14 , § 11, 4-4-17) 
Sec. 19-13. - Transfers and assignments. 
(a)  A transfer is any transaction in which (1) an ownership or other interest in a Licensee, its Cable System, or any person that is an operator of the Cable System is transferred from one (1) person or group of persons to another person or group of persons so that control of a Licensee is transferred; or (2) the rights or obligations held by a Licensee under a Cable License are transferred or assigned to another person or group of persons. Control for these purposes means working control, in whatever manner exercised. By way of illustration and not limitation, the addition, deletion, or other change of any general partner of a Licensee, any person who owns or controls a Licensee, or an operator of a Cable System is such a change of control. 
No transfer shall occur without prior approval of the City. The City shall act upon any request for approval of a sale or transfer within one hundred twenty (120) days after such request if such request contains or is accompanied by such information as is required by FCC regulations and by these licensing requirements. 
An Application for a transfer shall provide complete information on the proposed transaction, including details on the legal, financial, technical, and other qualifications of the proposed transferee, and on the potential impact of the transfer on Subscriber rates and service. At a minimum, the information required under federal law shall be provided with respect to the proposed transfer. The City may require additional information related to its determination regarding the proposed transfer. 
A License shall not be sold, assigned or transferred, either in whole or in part, or leased, sublet, or mortgaged in any manner, nor shall title thereto, either legal or equitable or any right, interest or property therein, pass to or vest in any person, except an Affiliate of Licensee, without prior written consent of the City, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
Such consent shall not be required for a transfer in trust, mortgage, or other hypothecation in whole or in part to secure an indebtedness. The proposed assignee must show the transfer will not cause any increased risks of nonperformance of the License or any loss to the City of its bargained for consideration in the License. The assignee's showings must at a minimum detail facts sufficient to show the assignee's technical ability, financial capability, legal qualifications and general character qualifications and such other qualifications as determined by the City and the assignee must agree to comply with all provisions of the License. 
(b)  Except for a transfer to an Affiliate of Licensee, no change, transfer, or acquisition of control of the Licensee shall occur without prior written consent of the City, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Licensee shall promptly notify the City of any actual or proposed change in, or transfer to, or acquisition by any other party, of control of the Licensee. The word "control" as used herein is not limited to major stockholders but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. 
(c)  A non-rebuttable presumption that transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or accumulation by any person, or group of persons (other than an Affiliate of Licensee), of more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting interest of the Licensee or of the person exercising management authority over the Licensee. 
(d)  Except in the case of an assignment of the License to an Affiliate of Licensee, upon written notification by the Licensee to the City of a proposed assignment of the License, or transfer of control or ownership of the Licensee company, the City Manager shall issue his written notice fixing and setting forth the day, hour and place certain when and where any persons having any interest therein may appear and be heard. The City Clerk shall cause such notice to be published in a newspaper of general circulation within the City. The City Clerk also shall cause a copy of such notice to be mailed to the Licensee at least ten (10) days prior to the date specified for the hearing. At the time set for such hearing, or at any adjournment thereof, the City Manager shall proceed to hear the matter. Following the close of such hearing, the City Manager shall prepare and file with the Council his report of the hearing, his findings, and an opinion containing his recommendations and the reasons therefor. If after the expiration of ten (10) days following receipt of the City Manager's report and opinion, the Council shall find that the assignment of the License or transfer of control or ownership of the Licensee company will not be detrimental or injurious to the best interests and welfare of the Subscribers and Users, and of the City, then the Council by resolution shall consent to the assignment of the License or transfer of control or ownership of the Licensee company. Such resolution shall thereupon become and shall be a part of any License granted under this Chapter and affected thereby. 
(e)  The consent or approval of the City Council to any transfer of a License shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the City in and to the Streets, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subordinate to the terms and conditions of the License. 
(f)  In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the City Council will not approve any transfer or assignment of a License within three years of and in no event prior to substantial Completion of Construction of a proposed Cable System. 
(g)  Fees. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this Chapter, each Applicant for a transfer or assignment must furnish with its request a nonrefundable filing fee in the amount established by the Council in Chapter 26 of this Code, by cash, certified or cashier's check wire transfer, or in any other manner acceptable to the City Manager made payable to the City of Peoria. No Proposal for a Transfer or Assignment of License shall be considered without receipt of said fee. The fee will be used for the purpose of covering the City's cost in consideration of a Transfer or Assignment of License. The fee shall be handled in the same manner as provided for an Initial License fee in Section 19-12 of this Chapter and shall, upon granting the assignment or transfer, be a credit against License Fees under this Chapter. 
(h)  The City may reserve in the License a right of first refusal to purchase a Licensee's Cable System. 
(i)  In no event shall a transfer of ownership be approved without the successor-in-interest becoming a signatory to the License. 
(j)  As long as a grant, rent or lease does not amount to a transfer as defined in this Section and is made in the ordinary course of business with prior notice to the City, a Licensee in the normal course of providing Cable Services or other telecommunication services may grant, rent, or lease use of its Cable System to other persons. Any such use shall be restricted to and consistent with such uses as the Licensee is authorized in this Chapter and the License. Any such use shall be in compliance with applicable federal and state law. Any such grants, lease or rent by the Licensee shall not, however, thereby relieve its use of the Streets and public ways, and any such grant, rent or lease shall require that such other person comply with the appropriate provisions of this Chapter and the License as such use warrants. The grant, lease or rent shall expressly provide for the authority of the City under applicable law to regulate the use provided by the grant, lease or rent (including but not limited to the authority to protect the public welfare, safety and health) and to enforce compliance with any applicable standards established by this Chapter or the License. 
(Ord. No. 2017-14 , § 12, 4-4-17) 
Sec. 19-14. - Acquisition by City. 
(a)  In accordance with Section 627 of the Cable Act, if a renewal of a License held by a Licensee is denied and the City acquires ownership of the Cable System or effects a transfer of ownership of a Cable System to another person, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at fair market value, determined on the basis of the Cable System valued as a going concern but with no value allocated to the License itself. If a License held by a Licensee is revoked or not renewed for cause and the City acquires ownership of the Cable System or effects a transfer of ownership of the Cable System to another person, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at a price not to exceed its fair market value as defined in this section. 
(b)  In the event that the City elects to purchase the Cable System upon expiration or termination of the term of any Cable License as provided herein, the current Licensee shall sell the Cable System to the City or its designee. The price for such sale shall be the fair market value of the Cable System, as defined in this section. 
(c)  In accordance with Section 627 of the Cable Act (as amended), if a renewal of a Cable License is denied and the City acquires ownership of the Cable System or effects a transfer of ownership of a Cable System to another person, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at fair market value, determined on the basis of the Cable System valued as a going concern but with no value allocated to the Cable License itself. 
(d)  If a Cable License held by a Licensee is revoked for cause and the City acquires ownership of the Cable System or effects a transfer of ownership of the Cable System to another person, any such acquisition or transfer shall be at fair market value, determined on the basis of the Cable System valued as a going concern but with no value allocated to the Cable License itself. 
(e)  No payment shall be made by the City to the Licensee that would include a value attributed to the License itself. 
(f)  The fair market value of the Cable System shall be determined as follows: 
(1)  The fair market value of the Cable System shall be determined by an appraisal committee consisting of three appraisers nationally recognized by training and experience as qualified to appraise the fair market value of a large, urban Cable System. No appraiser shall have previously acted in any capacity for either the City or Licensee. The appraisal committee shall function as an arbitration panel and shall conduct its appraisal process in Maricopa County, in accordance with the Center For Public Resources ("CPR") rules for non-administered arbitration of business disputes (the "Rules"), supplemented by the following procedures which shall control to the extent they conflict with the Rules: 
(2)  Each party shall appoint an appraiser within thirty (30) days after the City sends notice initiating appraisal proceedings. The two appraisers shall select a third appraiser within thirty (30) days after selection of the second appraiser. If the two appraisers are unable to agree on the appointment of a third appraiser within such thirty (30)-day period, either the City or the Licensee may petition the presiding civil judge of the Maricopa County Superior Court, acting in his or her individual capacity, for the selection of a third appraiser. 
(3)  Each party shall bear the cost of its own appraiser and one-half (1/2) of the cost of appointing the third appraiser and of paying the third appraiser's fee, and of any reasonable expenses incurred by the appraisers in order to carry out the appraisal process. 
(4)  Within thirty (30) days after selection of the third appraiser, the appraisers shall meet for the purpose of determining the manner in which the parties may present by evidence which may bear upon the appraisal. Within ninety (90) days after such meeting, the appraiser shall receive and consider such evidence and enter an award determining the fair market value of the Cable System consistent with the requirements of this Section 19-9. Such award shall be final and binding upon the parties, and judgment upon the award rendered may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof. 
(g)  Upon the termination of a License and the rights granted thereunder, whether by expiration or forfeiture, the City Council may direct and require the Licensee as provided in Section 19-52 to remove its wires, cables, fixtures and accessories and appurtenances from the Streets. If directed, the City shall make a claim on the letter of credit as prescribed in Section 19-83. 
(Ord. No. 2017-14 , § 13, 4-4-17) 
Sec. 19-15. - Rights reserved to the City. 
(a)  Nothing herein shall be deemed or construed to impair or affect, in any way, to any extent, the right of the City to acquire the property of the Licensee, by purchase, at fair market value, which shall not include any amount for the License itself or for any of the rights or privileges granted. And nothing herein contained shall be construed to contract away or to modify or abridge, either for a term or in perpetuity, the City's right of eminent domain at fair market value. 
(b)  There is hereby reserved to the City every right and power which is required to be herein reserved or provided by any provision of the charter or code, and a Licensee shall comply with any action or requirements of the City in its exercise of such rights or power heretofore or hereafter enacted or established. 
(c)  Neither the granting of any License hereunder nor any of the provisions contained herein shall be construed to prevent the City from granting any identical, or similar, License to any other person, firm or corporation, within the City. 
(d)  Neither the granting of any License nor the enactment of any provision in this Chapter shall constitute a waiver or bar to the exercise of any governmental right or power of the City, now existing or hereafter granted. 
(e)  The City Council may do all things which are necessary and convenient in the exercise of its jurisdiction under this Chapter and may, through the City Manager or through its own action, adjust, settle, compromise or otherwise resolve, pursuant to Sections 19-86 and 19-87, any controversy or charge arising from the operations of any Licensee under this Chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2017-14 , § 14, 4-4-17) 
Secs. 19-16-19-19. - Reserved. 
Sec. 19-20. - Fees; costs and payments; Application of Initial License. 
(a)  Amount. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this Chapter, each Applicant for an Initial License must furnish with its Proposal a nonrefundable application fee in the amount established by the council in Chapter 26 of this Code, by cash, certified or cashier's check wire transfer, or in any other manner acceptable to the City Manager made payable to the City of Peoria. No Proposal for an Initial License shall be considered without receipt of said fee. The application fee shall be in an amount necessary to recover all reasonably related costs incurred by the City to review and process the application, with the minimum amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00). 
(b)  Deposit and Use. All fees received will be deposited to an account of the City and will serve to recover expenses incurred by the City in the preparation and granting of Initial Licenses and regulation of Licenses pursuant to this Chapter. 
(c)  Additional Fee. Any Licensee under an Initial License, upon acceptance of such Initial License, shall reimburse all additional expenses, including, but not limited to, any and all administrative, engineering, publication, or legal costs and consultants' expenses incurred in connection with the processing, evaluation and preparation of documents relating to the Initial License. The City shall document all such expenses by invoice. If expenses exceed the total amount of filing fees collected from the Applicant(s), the Licensee shall pay to the City the excess amount within thirty (30) days of demand of the City. All unpaid amounts at the end of thirty days shall accrue interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (11/2%) per month. 
(d)  For the reasons that the Public Street, road, alley, and other public Rights-of-Way which are used by the Licensee in the operation of its Cable System within the boundaries of the City are valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the City at great expense to its taxpayers, and that the grant to the Cable Licensee for the use of said Streets and public ways is a valuable property right without which the Licensee would be required to invest substantial capital in Right-of-Way costs and acquisitions, and because the City will incur costs in regulating and administering the Cable License, the Licensee shall pay to the City an amount as allowed by statute pursuant to A.R.S. § 9-506 as amended, currently five percent (5%) of Licensee's Gross Revenues ("the License Fee"). 
(e)  If a Cable Licensee offers Subscribers a price discount if they obtain a bundle of Cable Service and one (1) or more non-Cable Service goods or services, then beginning on the effective date of this License for the purpose of computing Gross Revenues, the discount shall be allocated either (1) consistent with the prices published in Licensee's marketing materials or rate card for separate Cable Service or one (1) or more non-Cable Services or (2) in proportion to the value of those Cable Services and non-Cable Service goods and services for which individual prices are not published. It is the intent of this subsection that a Licensee not bundle Cable Services with non-Cable Services in such a manner that the amount of Gross Revenues attributed to the Cable Services will unreasonably or significantly reduce the License fees payable under the License. 
(f)  A Licensee is entitled to offset against License fees due to the City as provided in A.R.S. Title 9 unless provided otherwise in the License Agreement. 
(g)  If Federal or State laws are amended to allow fee payments greater than those specified in Section 46-8.8(A) or to include internet, dial tone, or other services or activities on the Cable System, the fee payment shall thereafter include the charges allowed by Federal or State law. 
(h)  Licensee and the City are subject to the requirements of State law, including but not limited to A.R.S. § 9-506 as amended. 
(Ord. No. 2017-14 , § 16, 4-4-17) 
Sec. 19-21. - Duration of License. 
    The duration of the rights, privileges and authorizations granted in an Initial or a Renewal License shall not exceed ten (10) years. A License may be renewed by the City pursuant to the procedure established in this Code and in accordance with the then applicable law. 
(Ord. No. 2017-14 , § 17, 4-4-17) 
Secs. 19-22-19-24. - Reserved. 
Sec. 19-25. - Effect of award of License. 
(a)  Ordinance Binding. Upon award of an Initial or a Renewal License pursuant to this Chapter, a Licensee shall agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions contained herein. 
(b)  Incorporation by reference of proposal for Initial or Renewal License. A Licensee under an Initial or Renewal License also agrees to provide all of the Cable Services specifically set forth in its Proposal, if provided, to provide Cable Services within the confines of the City and by its acceptance of the Initial or Renewal License, the Licensee specifically agrees that its Proposal is hereby incorporated by reference and made a part of the Initial or Renewal License. If such Proposal and the provisions of this Chapter conflict with the applicable Initial or Renewal License, that provision which provides the greatest benefit to the City, in the opinion of the City Council, shall prevail provided that, the City, having chosen or accepted one of the conflicting provisions, may not thereafter elect to require compliance with a different alternative of the conflicting provisions. Failure to provide services as promised in Licensee's Proposal or agreed to in its License may be deemed a breach of this Chapter to which the provisions of Sections 19-84 and 19-85 of this Chapter shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 2017-14 , § 19, 4-4-17) 
Sec. 19-26. - Payment of License Fee. 
(a)  For the reasons that the Streets and other public Rights-of-Way which are used by the Licensee in the operation of its Cable System within the boundaries of the City are valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the City at great expense to its taxpayers, and that the grant to the Licensee for the use of said Streets is a valuable property right without which the Licensee would be required to invest substantial capital in Right-of-Way costs and acquisitions, and because the City will incur costs in regulating and administering the License, the Licensee shall pay to the City an amount no less than five percent (5%) of Licensee's Gross Revenues (the "License Fee"). 
(b)  Should federal regulations be amended in the future to allow the City to receive a greater fee than the fee set forth in Paragraph (a) then, in that event, the City shall have the right to increase the fee as specified in the License. 
(c)  The payment of the License Fee by the Licensee to the City shall be made quarterly by delivery of the same to the City Manager on or before the 20th day of the following month, with a ten-day grace period. If such payment is not made by the next to the last business day of the following month, the City may impose interest at a rate of one and one-half percent (11/2%) per month commencing from the date payment should have been made and continuing until the payment is made. Fractions of a month shall be considered to constitute a full month for the purpose of computing interest. In addition to interest which may be assessed under this Subsection, if Licensee fails to pay any License Fee, before the end of such grace period, Licensee shall be subject to the following civil penalties: 
(1)  A Licensee who fails to pay the License Fee or any portion thereof within the time prescribed shall pay a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the unpaid fee each month, unless the Licensee shows that the failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. 
(2)  A Licensee who fails or refuses to pay a License Fee or any portion thereof after notice and demand by the City shall pay a penalty of twenty-five percent (25%) of the unpaid fee, unless Licensee shows that the failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. 
(3)  If the cause of failure to pay the Licensee fee or any portion thereof is determined by the City to be due to civil fraud or evasion of the License Fee, the Licensee shall pay a penalty of fifty percent (50%) of the amount of deficiency. 
(d)  The City shall have the right to inspect the Licensee's income records and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this Chapter provided, however, that such audit shall take place within thirty-six (36) months following the close of each of the Licensee's fiscal years. Any additional amount due to the City as a result of the audit shall be paid within thirty (30) days following written notice to the Licensee by the City, said notice shall include a copy of the audit report; provided, however, that Licensee shall not be required to pay such deficiency until thirty (30) days after completion of the administrative review process if Licensee commences such process pursuant to Section 19-86(a)(3). If there is a deficiency in the payment of License Fees to the City of ten percent (10%) or more, the City may assess the cost of the audit to the Licensee. 
(e)  The cost to Licensee of any City plan review and Right-of-Way construction permit fees which City imposes under City code requirements on Licensee's construction permit activities on the City Streets shall be included in the License Fee. 
(f)  Under terms specified in the License, there shall be allowed as an offset against the License Fee due under this Section any amounts Licensee paid to the City during the prior quarter in privilege license (sales) taxes; provided, however, that there shall be no offset to the extent that Licensee made payments of privilege license (sales) taxes on any gross income (within the meaning of the privilege license [sales] tax ordinance) which is not included in Gross Revenues under this Chapter. 
(g)  In accordance with A.R.S. § 9-506(C) the City may require that a Licensee: 
1.  Bear reasonable costs that are associated with damage caused to Public Streets, roads and alleys by construction, maintenance and operation of its facilities in the Public Streets, roads and alleys and that are imposed on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis in relation to costs borne by corporations. 
2.  Pay fines, fees, charges or damages for breach of the terms and conditions of the License. 
(h)  Licensee will bear all costs of installing, constructing, operating or removing Cable System facilities for its system. 
(i)  In addition to the License fees specified in an agreement between the City and Licensee, Licensee will also compensate the owner of the property for any damages resulting from the installation, construction, operation, and/or removal of cable facilities. 
(j)  At the time License fees are due, Licensee will provide to the City an itemized report that includes the following information: 
1.  The amount of License fees due to the City, 
2.  A detailed report of all costs incurred by Licensee and the portion of such costs that are being offset in accordance with subsection (C), 
3.  The amount of License fees, if any, being paid to the City after accounting for any offset, and 
4.  A current revenue statement showing the Gross Revenues by the Licensee during the preceding quarter. 
(k)  In addition to interest that may be assessed, if Licensee fails to pay any License fee, before the end of such grace period, Licensee shall be subject to the following civil penalties: 
1.  A Licensee who fails to timely file a report for a License fee imposed by these licensing requirements shall pay a penalty of five (5) percent of the License fee for each month or fraction of a month elapsing between the delinquency date of the report and the date on which it is filed, unless the Licensee shows that the failure to timely file is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. This penalty shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the License fee due. 
2.  A Licensee who fails to pay the License fee within the time imposed by these licensing requirements shall pay a penalty of ten (10) percent of the unpaid License fee, unless the Licensee shows that the failure to timely pay is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. If the Licensee is also subject to a penalty under paragraph (1) above for the same License fee period, the total penalties under paragraph (1) and this paragraph shall not exceed twenty-five (25) percent of the License fee due. 
3.

(a)  Residential Service. Licensee shall make Cable Services available to dwelling units within the City and shall extend its Cable System as contemplated under this Section as follows. Each unit in an MDU shall be counted as a dwelling unit in determining the residential density, provided a mutually acceptable agreement granting Licensee reasonable access to the MDU has been executed and delivered. Licensee shall not be required to make service available to residents of Multiple Dwelling Units where the owner of the property has not granted Licensee such reasonable access to the property. 
(1)  When requested by a resident or developer in the City, Licensee shall, at Licensee's sole expense, extend the Cable System to any single family residence or dwelling within the City, provided that such extension involves density of twenty-five (25) existing homes per mile as measured in linear trench or aerial strand footage from the nearest technically feasible point of connection on the Cable System. Such extension(s) shall include cutting in one or more taps and extending cable as necessary. 
(2)  When a resident or developer in the City requests an extension of service to an area that does not meet the minimum density of twenty-five (25) existing homes per mile as measured in linear trench or aerial strand footage from the nearest technically feasible point of connection on the Cable System, Licensee shall be required to comply with such request only if the resident or developer agrees to pay to the Licensee an amount equal to all incremental costs incurred beyond those for an extension otherwise involving a density of twenty-five (25) existing homes per mile. The incremental costs to be paid shall be Licensee's costs (reasonable labor and materials) of extending the Cable System consistently with Licensee's overall system design to the residence, or to and throughout the development, from the nearest technically feasible point of connection on the Cable System. The costs shall include splicing in one or more taps and extending cable. 
(3)  Where there is a request by a developer for an extension to a development which does not meet the minimum density test in Subsection (2) and where, instead of proceeding under Subsection (2), the developer agrees to pay Licensee's full costs (reasonable labor and materials) of extending the Cable System from the nearest technically feasible point of connection on the Cable System to the nearest Street access to the development, Licensee shall then extend the Cable System within the development, at Licensee's sole cost, if it has a density of twenty (20) existing homes per mile, as measured in linear trench or aerial strand footage from the nearest Street access to the development to which the developer paid to have the Cable System extended. 
(4)  To prevent unnecessary disruption and damage to Streets, rights-of-way, and other property, the installation of Cable System shall be accomplished in new subdivisions at the same time, and in the same trench as other communications, electric and other permanent services to structures. Except as federal law may grant them other rights, developers of new residential buildings or mobile homes within a new or undeveloped subdivision, new residential units within new multiple occupancy residential developments, and new commercial and industrial buildings and structures shall treat cable television facilities as they treat other communication facilities, utilities and other underground facilities, in regards to availability and cost of trenching for undergroundings.

Each Service Area must be defined in a manner that demonstrates a Substantial Nexus between the Capital Facilities to be provided in the Service Area and the Service Units to be served by those Capital Facilities. For Libraries and for Parks larger than 30 acres, each Service Area must be defined in a manner that demonstrates a Direct Benefit between the Capital Facilities and the Service Units to be served by those Capital Facilities. 
The City may cover more than one category of Capital Facilities in the same Service Area provided that there is an independent Substantial Nexus or Direct Benefit, as applicable, between each Category of Necessary Public Services and the Service Units to be served. 
(3)  Identify and describe the Land Use Assumptions upon which the Infrastructure Improvements Plan is based in each Service Area. 
(4)  Analyze and identify the existing Level of Service provided by the City to existing Service Units for each Category of Necessary Public Services in each Service Area. 
(5)  Identify the Level of Service to be provided by the City for each Category of Necessary Public Services in each Service Area based on the relevant Land Use Assumptions and any established City standards or policies related to required Levels of Service. If the City provides the same Category of Necessary Public Services in more than one Service Area, the Infrastructure Improvements Plan shall include a comparison of the Levels of Service to be provided in each Service Area. 
(6)  For each Category of Necessary Public Services, analyze and identify the existing capacity of the Capital Facilities in each Service Area, the utilization of those Capital Facilities by existing Service Units and the available excess capacity of those Capital Facilities to serve new Service Units including any existing or planned commitments or agreements for the usage of such capacity. 
(7)  Estimate the total number of existing and future Service Units within each Service Area based on the City's Land Use Assumptions. 
(8)  Based on the analysis in subsections (3)-(6) above, provide a summary table or tables describing the Level of Service for each Category of Necessary Public Services by relating the required Capital Facilities to Service Units in each Service Area, and identifying the applicable Service Unit factor associated with each Category of Development. 
(9)  For each Category of Necessary Public Services, analyze and identify the projected utilization of any available excess capacity in existing Capital Facilities, and all new or expanded Capital Facilities that will be required to provide and maintain the planned Level of Service in each Service Area as a result of the new projected Service Units in that Service Area, for a period not to exceed ten (10) years. Nothing in this Subsection shall prohibit the City from additionally including in its Infrastructure Improvements Plan projected utilization of, or needs for, Capital Facilities for a period longer than ten (10) years, provided that the costs of such Capital Facilities are excluded from the calculation of the Plan-Based Cost per Service Unit. 
(10)  For each Category of Necessary Public Services, estimate the total cost of any available excess capacity and/or new or expanded Capital Facilities that will be required to serve new Service Units, including costs of land acquisition, improvements, engineering and architectural services, studies leading to design, design, construction, financing, and administrative costs. Such total costs shall not include costs for ongoing operation and maintenance of Capital Facilities, nor for replacement of Capital Facilities to the extent that such replacement is necessary to serve existing Service Units. If the Infrastructure Improvements Plan includes changes or upgrades to existing Capital Facilities that will be needed to achieve or maintain the planned Level of Service to existing Service Units, or to meet new regulatory requirements for services provided to existing Service Units, such costs shall be identified and distinguished in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan. 
(11)  Forecast the revenues from taxes, fees, assessments or other sources that will be available to fund the new or expanded Capital Facilities identified in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan, which shall include estimated state-shared revenue, highway users revenue, federal revenue, ad valorem property taxes, construction contracting or similar excise taxes and the capital recovery portion of utility fees attributable to development based on the approved Land Use Assumptions. 
(12)  Calculate required Offsets as follows: 
a.  Identify those sources of revenue that: (i) are attributable to new development, and (ii) will contribute to paying for the capital costs of Necessary Public Services. 
b.  For each source of revenue identified pursuant to paragraph a of this Subsection, calculate the relative contribution of new development paying for the capital costs of Necessary Public Services in each Service Area. 
c.  Based on the relative contributions identified pursuant to paragraph b of this Subsection, for each Category of Necessary Public Services, calculate the total Offset per Service Unit to be provided in each Service Area. 
d.  Beginning August 1, 2014, for purposes of calculating the required Offset, if the City imposes a construction, contracting, or similar excise tax rate in excess of the percentage amount of the transaction privilege tax rate that is imposed on the majority of other transaction privilege tax classifications in the City, the entire excess portion of the construction, contracting, or similar excise tax shall be treated as a contribution to the capital costs of Necessary Public Services provided to new development unless the excess portion is already utilized for such purpose pursuant to this Section. 
(13)  Calculate the Cost per Service Unit by: 
a.  Dividing the total projected costs to provide Capital Facilities to new Service Units for each Category of Necessary Public Services in each Service Area as determined pursuant to Subsections 1 through 11 of this Section by the total number of new Service Units projected for that Service Area over a period not to exceed ten (10) years for each Category of Necessary Public Services. 
b.  Subtracting the required Offset per Service Unit calculated pursuant to Subsection 12 of this Section. 
(b)  Multiple Plans. An Infrastructure Improvements Plan adopted pursuant to this Subsection may address one or more of the City's Categories of Necessary Public Services in any or all of the City's Service Areas. Each Capital Facility shall be subject to no more than one Infrastructure Improvements Plan at any given time. 
(c)  Reserved Capacity. The City may reserve capacity in an Infrastructure Improvements Plan to serve one or more planned future developments. All reservations of existing capacity must be identified in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan at the time it is adopted.

(Ord. No. 02-59, 6/18/02, Amended (SUPP 2002-2); Ord. No. 2014-19, 5/6/14, Enacted (SUPP 2014-2)) 
Sec. 20-39. - Development fees; collection. 
(a)  Collection. Development fees, together with any administrative charges assessed to defray the costs of administering Sections 20-30-20-43, shall be calculated and collected at issuance of permission to commence development; specifically: 
(1)  Development fees shall be paid at the time of issuance of a Building Permit according to the current development fee schedule for the applicable Service Area(s) as adopted pursuant to this code, or according to any other applicable development fee schedule as authorized in this Chapter. 
a.  The City shall determine the amount of each required development fee through the use of the applicable fee schedule. 
b.  The City shall determine the Category of Development for each development based on overall, long-term impact of the development. In general, impact fees shall be assessed based on the principal use of a building or lot. For example, a warehouse that contains an administrative office would be assessed at the warehouse rate for all of the square footage. Shopping centers shall be assessed at the retail/commercial rate, regardless of the type of tenants. For a true mixed-use development, such as one that includes both residential and nonresidential development, the fee shall be determined by adding up the fees that would be payable for each use as if it was a free-standing land use type pursuant to the fee schedule. For uses that cannot readily be designated under a particular Category of Development, the City Manager or his designee shall determine the category the particular use will be assigned based on which category has a daily trip generation rate most similar to the proposed use. 
c.  The City shall determine the water meter size for each lot based on the actual meter size installed on each lot. If the exact meter size is not listed in a table, then the City shall use the next largest meter size in such table. If a lot consists of two (2) or more separate areas with separate meters in each separate area, then the development fee shall be determined by adding up all the fees that would be applicable for each meter size in each separate area. 
d.  In assessing the development fees for Non-Residential land use types, square footage shall be measured in terms of Gross Floor Area, and any determination of square footage shall be in whole units, with any fractions thereof being rounded up to the next square foot. 
e.  Development fees for development projects involving an addition to or remodeling of an existing facility, change of use, change of housing type, change of meter size or other modification or redevelopment of a previously developed lot or building with a valid certificate of occupancy shall be calculated as follows: the applicable development fees for the proposed development as set forth in the current development fee schedules minus the applicable development fees for the previous development as set forth in the current development fee schedules. In the event that the difference is negative, no refund of previously paid development fees shall be made. 
(2)  If a Building Permit is not required for the development, but water connections are required, any and all development fees due shall be paid at the time the water service connection is purchased. If no Building Permit or water connection is required, all development fees shall be paid prior to development approval. 
(3)  In determining the amount of fees required for land included in a community facilities district established under A.R.S. Title 48, Chapter 4, Article 6, the City shall take into account any Capital Facilities provided by the district that are included in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan ("Included Capital Facilities") and the capital costs paid by the district for such Included Capital Facilities, and shall reduce development fees assessed within the community facilities district proportionally. 
(4)  No Building Permit, water or sewer connection, or certificate of occupancy shall be issued if a development fee is not paid as directed in the previous paragraphs. 
(5)  If the Building Permit is for a change in the type of building use, an increase in square footage, a change to land use, or an additional or upgraded point of demand to the water system, the development fee shall be assessed on the additional service units resulting from the expansion or change, and following the development fee schedule applicable to any new use type. 
(6)  For issued permits that expire or are voided, development fees and administrative charges shall be as follows: 
a.  If the original permittee is seeking to renew an expired or voided permit, and the development fees paid for such development have not been refunded, then the permittee shall pay the difference between any development fees paid at the time the permit was issued and those in the fee schedule at the time the permit is reissued or renewed. 
b.  If a new or renewed permit for the same development is being sought by someone other than the original permittee, the new permit Applicant shall pay the full development fees specified in the fee schedule in effect at the time that the permits are reissued or renewed. If the original permittee has assigned its rights under the permits to the new permit Applicant in writing, the new permit Applicant shall pay development fees as if it were the original permittee upon presentation of such written assignment to the City. 
(b)  Exceptions. Development fees shall not be owed under any of the following conditions. 
(1)  Development fees have been paid for the development and the permit(s) which triggered the collection of the development fees have not expired or been voided. 
(2)  The approval(s) that trigger the collection of development fees involve modifications to existing development that do not: (a) add new Service Units, (b) increase the impact of existing Service Units on existing or future Capital Facilities, or (c) change the land-use type of the existing development to a different Category of Development for which a higher development fee would have been due. To the extent that any modification does not meet the requirements of this paragraph, the development fee due shall be the difference between the development fee that was or would have been due on the existing development and the development fee that is due on the development as modified. 
(3)  Public schools and charter schools shall be exempt from payment of Fire and Police development fees to the extent provided by law. 
(4)  Temporary structures for which an administrative use permit is secured for use as a sales office and not for residential or other purposes and intended to be removed within the two-year period granted under the use permit shall be exempt from development fees. This exemption shall not apply where the temporary building is erected on a parcel of land upon which a permanent building with permanent facilities is to be constructed. 
(c)  Temporary Exemptions from Development Fee Schedules. New developments in the City shall be temporarily exempt from increases in development fees that result from the adoption of new or modified development fee schedules as follows: 
(1)  Single-Family Uses. On or after the day that the first building permit is issued for a Single-Family Detached subdivision development, the City shall, at the permittee's request, provide the permittee with an applicable development fee schedule that shall be in force for a period of 24 months beginning on the day that the first building permit is issued for the subdivision, and which shall expire at the end of the first business day of the 25th month thereafter. During the effective period of the applicable development fee schedule, any building permit issued for the same Single-Family subdivision development shall not be subject to any new or modified development fee schedule, provided that if the City reduces the amount of an applicable development fee during the period that a grandfathered development fee schedule is in force, the City shall assess the lower development fee. 
(2)  Non-Residential and Multi-Family Uses. On or after the day that the final approval is issued for a Non-Residential or Multi-Family development, the City shall provide an applicable development fee schedule that shall be in force for a period of 24 months beginning on the day that final development approval of a site plan and/or final commercial subdivision plat is given, whichever is earlier, and which shall expire at the end of the first business day of the 25th month thereafter. For the purpose of this paragraph, final approval shall mean the approval of a site plan or, if no site plan is required to be submitted for the development, the approval of a final subdivision plat If no site plan or final subdivision plat is required, final approval shall mean the issuance of the first building permit on the property. During the effective period of the applicable development fee schedule, any building permit issued for the same development shall not be subject to any new or modified development fee schedule, provided that if the City reduces the amount of an applicable development fee during the period that a grandfathered development fee schedule is in force, the City shall assess the lower development fee. 
(3)  Other Development. Any development not covered under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Subsection shall pay development fees according to the fee schedule that is current at the time of collection as specified in Subsection A of this Section. 
(4)  Changes to Site Plans and Subdivision Plats. Notwithstanding the other requirements of this Subsection, if changes are made to a development's final site plan or subdivision plat that will increase the number of service units after the issuance of a grandfathered development fee schedule, the City may assess any new or modified development fees against the additional service units. 
(Ord. No. 02-59, 6/18/02, Amended (SUPP 2002-2); Ord. No. 2014-19, 5/6/14, Enacted (SUPP 2014-2)) 
Sec. 20-40. - Development fees; credits. 
(a)  Eligibility of Capital Facility. All development fee Credits must meet the following requirements: 
1.  One of the following is true: 
a.  The Capital Facility or the financial contribution toward a Capital Facility that will be provided by the Developer and for which a Credit will be issued must be identified in an adopted Infrastructure Improvements Plan as a Capital Facility for which a development fee was assessed; or 
b.  The Applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that, given the class and type of improvement, the subject Capital Facility should have been included in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan in lieu of a different Capital Facility that was included in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan and for which a development fee was assessed. If the subject Capital Facility is determined to be eligible for a Credit in this manner, the City shall amend the Infrastructure Improvements Plan to (i) include the subject replacement facility and (ii) delete the facility that will be replaced. The decision of the City on such determinations is final and not subject to any appeal under this code. 
2.  Credits shall not be available for any Capital Facility provided by a Developer if the cost of such Capital Facility will be repaid to the Developer by the City through another agreement or mechanism. To the extent that the Developer will be paid or reimbursed by the City for any contribution, payment, construction, or dedication from any City funding source, any Credits claimed by the Developer shall be: (a) deducted from any amounts to be paid or reimbursed by the City; or (b) reduced by the amount of such payment or reimbursement. 
(b)  Eligibility of Subject Development. To be eligible for a Credit, the Subject Development must be located within the Service Area of the eligible Capital Facility. 
(c)  Calculation of Credits. Credits will be based on that portion of the costs for an eligible Capital Facility identified in the adopted Infrastructure Improvements Plan for which a development fee was assessed. If the Gross Development Fee for a particular Category of Necessary Public Service is adopted at an amount lower than the Cost per Service Unit, the amount of any Credit shall be reduced in proportion to the difference between the Cost per Service Unit and the Gross Development Fee adopted. A Credit shall not exceed the actual costs the Applicant incurred in providing the eligible Capital Facility, nor shall it exceed the amount of the applicable development fee for the Subject Development. 
(d)  Allocation of Credits. Before any Credit can be issued to a Subject Development (or portion thereof), the Credit must be allocated to that development as follows: 
(1)  The Developer and the City must execute a Credit Allocation Agreement including all of the following: 
a.  The total amount of the Credits resulting from provision of an eligible Capital Facility. 
b.  The estimated number of Service Units to be served within the Subject Development. 
c.  The method by which the Credit values will be allocated within the Subject Development. 
(2)  It is the sole obligation of the Developer to request allocation of development fee Credits by the City through an application for a Credit Allocation Agreement. 
(3)  If a building permit is issued or a water connection is purchased, and a development fee is paid prior to execution of a Credit Allocation Agreement for the Subject Development, no Credits may be allocated retroactively to that permit or connection. Credits may be allocated to any remaining permits for the Subject Development in accordance with this Chapter. 
(4)  If the entity that provides an eligible Capital Facility sells or relinquishes a development (or portion thereof) that it owns or controls prior to execution of a Credit Allocation Agreement, Credits will only be allocated to the development if the entity legally assigns such rights and responsibilities to its successor(s) in interest for the Subject Development, together with an agreement for the assignment of and assumption of all duties between entity and the City pursuant to any agreements between the entity and City. 
(5)  If multiple entities jointly provide an eligible Capital Facility, all entities must enter into a single Credit Allocation Agreement with the City, and any request for the allocation of Credit within the Subject Development(s) must be made jointly by the entities that provided the eligible Capital Facility. Failure by any entity to enter into a Credit Allocation Agreement with the City shall be deemed a waiver of any rights to receive credits under this Chapter. 
(6)  No assignment or assumption of any Credit Allocation Agreement shall be recognized by the City unless such written assignment or assumption of the Credit Allocation Agreement is filed with the City Clerk of the City. 
(e)  Credit Agreement. Credits shall only be issued pursuant to a Credit Allocation Agreement executed in accordance with Subsection (d) of this Section. The City Council may authorize the City Manager to enter into a Credit Allocation Agreement as part of the approval of zoning and/or development agreements with the controlling entity of a Subject Development, subject to the following: 
(1)  The Developer requesting the Credit Agreement shall provide all information requested by the City to allow it to determine the value of the Credit to be applied. 
(2)  An application for a Credit Allocation Agreement shall be submitted to the City by the Developer not later than the one year anniversary of the date that the City accepted completion of and assumed ownership and/or control of the Capital Facility. Failure to submit an application for a Credit Allocation Agreement to the City shall be deemed a waiver of any rights to receive credits under this Chapter. 
(3)  The City shall promulgate a form Credit Allocation Agreement that has been approved by the City Attorney pursuant to Article VIII, Section 1 of the Peoria City Charter. The Developer shall review and submit all of the information set forth in this paragraph (3) for review by the City. The Credit Allocation Agreement shall include, at a minimum, all of the following information and supporting documentation: 
a.  A legal description and map depicting the location of the Subject Development for which Credit is being applied. The map shall depict the location of the Capital Facilities that have been or will be provided. 
b.  An estimate of the total Service Units that will be developed within the Subject Development depicted on the map and described in the legal description. 
c.  A list of the Capital Facilities, associated physical attributes and the related costs as stated in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan. 
d.  Documentation showing the date(s) and letters of acceptance by the City, if the Capital Facilities have already been provided. 
e.  The total amount of Credit to be applied within the Subject Development and the calculations leading to the total amount of Credit. 
f.  The Credit amount to be applied to each Service Unit within the Subject Development for each Category of Necessary Public Services. 
(4)  The applicant shall pay the cost incurred by the City in making the determination as set forth in Chapter 2 of this Code. The City as a condition of proceeding with the application will require a deposit of the reasonably estimated cost. The City's determination of the Credit to be allocated is final and not subject to any further review. 
(5)  Upon execution of the Credit Allocation Agreement by the City and the Applicant, Credits shall be deemed allocated to the Subject Development and applied to development fee charges as incurred. No Credit Allocation Agreement shall give rise to any other financial obligation by the City other than the provision of credits against Development Fees in accordance with the terms of the Credit Allocation Agreement. 
(6)  Any amendment to a previously approved Credit Allocation Agreement must be initiated within two (2) years of the City's final acceptance of the eligible Capital Facility for which the amendment is requested or such right to request an amendment is deemed irrevocably waived. 
(7)  Development credits must be used within ten (10) years from the date of the Credit Allocation Agreement or are deemed irrevocably forfeited. 
(f)  Issuance of Credits. Credits allocated pursuant to Subsection (d) of this Section may be issued and applied toward the Gross Development Fees due from a development, subject to the following conditions: 
(1)  Credits issued for an eligible Capital Facility may only be applied to the development fee due for the applicable Category of Necessary Public Services, and may not be applied to any fee due for another Category of Necessary Public Services. 
(2)  Credits shall only be issued when the eligible Capital Facility from which the Credits were derived has been accepted by the City or acceptable forms of assurance are approved in writing by the City. 
(3)  Where Credits have been issued pursuant to paragraph (2) of this Subsection, a development fee due at the time a building permit is issued shall be reduced by the Credit amount stated in or calculated from the executed Credit Agreement. Where Credits have not yet been issued, the Gross Development Fee shall be paid in full. 
(4)  Credits, once issued, may not be rescinded or reallocated to another permit or parcel, except that Credits may be released for reuse on the same Subject Development if a building permit for which the Credits were issued has expired or been voided and is otherwise eligible for a refund under Section 20-32.(a)(2)(a) of this Chapter.

Sec. 20-41. - Development fees; appeals. 
    A development fee determination by City staff may be appealed in accordance with the following procedures: 
(a)  Limited Scope. An appeal shall be limited only to disputes regarding the calculation of the development fees for a specific development and/or permit and calculation of Service Units for the development. No other administrative actions of the City pursuant to Sections 20-30-20-43 of this code shall be subject to appeal. 
(b)  Form of Appeal. An appeal shall be initiated on such written form as the City may prescribe and submitted to the Finance Director. The Applicant shall submit a written notice of appeal with a full statement of the grounds and an appeal fee as provided in Chapter 2 of this Code. 
(c)  Action by Hearing Officer.

(d)  Final Decision. The Hearing Officer's decision regarding the appeal is final. 
(e)  Fees During Pendency. Building permits may be issued during the pendency of an appeal if the Applicant (1) pays the full development fee calculated by the City at the time the appeal is filed or (2) provides the City with financial assurances in the form acceptable to the City Manager or authorized designee equal to the full amount of the development fee. Upon final disposition of an appeal, the fee shall be adjusted in accordance with the decision rendered, and a refund paid if warranted. If the appeal is denied by the Hearing Officer, and the Applicant has provided the City with financial assurances as set forth in clause (2) above, the Applicant shall deliver the full amount of the development fee to the City within ten days of the Hearing Officer's final decision on the appeal. If the Applicant fails to deliver the full amount of the development fees when required by this Subsection, the City may draw upon such financial assurance instrument(s) as necessary to recover the full amount of the development fees due from the Applicant.

e.  The development fee was calculated and collected for the construction cost to provide all or a portion of a specific Capital Facility serving the subject real property and the actual construction costs as certified by the City Manager or his designee for the Capital Facility are less than the construction costs projected in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan by a factor of 10% or more. In such event, the current owner of the subject real property shall, upon request as set forth in this Section A, be entitled to a refund for the difference between the amounts of the development fee charged for and attributable to such construction cost and the amount the development fee would have been calculated to be if the actual construction cost had been included in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan. In performing the recalculation, the City may take into consideration actual construction costs for other improvements serving the subject real property that were included in the Infrastructure Improvements Plan for the same Category of Necessary Public Facilities. The refund contemplated by this Subsection shall relate only to the costs specific to the construction of the applicable Capital Facility and shall not include any related design, administrative, or other costs not directly incurred for construction of the Capital Facility that are included in the development fee as permitted by A.R.S. § 9-463.05. 
(b)  Earned Interest. A refund of a development fee shall include any interest actually earned on the refunded portion of the development fee by the City from the date of collection to the date of refund. All refunds shall be made to the record owner of the property at the time the refund is paid. 
(c)  Refund to Government. If a development fee was paid by a governmental entity, any refund shall be paid to that governmental entity. 
(d)  Correction of Errors. The City Manager or his designee is hereby authorized and directed to correct any error in the assessment and collection of development fees detected within twenty-four (24) months of the date of the payment of the development fees, including assessing additional development fee amounts or issuing a refund from the appropriate development fee fund(s), to the extent of their authority to do so. If such refund exceeds the authority of the City Manager, it shall be submitted to the City Council for a determination. 
(e)  No Refund for Change of Development. After a development fee has been paid pursuant to this Chapter, no refund of any part of such development fee shall be made if the development for which the development fee was paid is later demolished, destroyed, or is altered, reconstructed, or reconfigured so as to reduce the size of the development, the number of units in the development, or the number of Service Units.

Sec. 20-200. - Floodplain management; statutory authorization. 
    In A.R.S. § 48-3610, the Arizona State Legislature enabled the City of Peoria, an Arizona, municipal corporation to adopt regulations in conformance with A.R.S. § 48-3603 designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. 
(Ord. No. 98-102, 9/22/98, enacted; Ord. No. 02-41, 6/4/2002, Amended (SUPP 2002-2); Ord. No. 2013-15, 9/3/13, Amended (SUPP 2013-3); Ord. 2014-40, 11/25/14, Repealed and Enacted (SUPP 2014-4)) 
State Law reference- Floodplain delineation; regulation of use, A.R.S. § 48-3609. 
Sec. 20-201. - Floodplain management; finding of fact. 
A.  The flood hazard areas of the City of Peoria are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
B.  These flood losses may be caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities and, when inadequately anchored, cause damage in other areas. Uses that are inadequately flood proofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage, also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Ord. No. 98-102, 9/22/98, enacted; Ord. No. 2013-15, 9/3/13, Amended (SUPP 2013-3); Ord. 2014-40, 11/25/14, Repealed and Enacted (SUPP 2014-4))

1.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, sanitary, building, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; 
2.  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    Variance. A grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this ordinance. 
    Violation. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

Sec. 20-240. - Floodplain management; nature of variances. 
    The variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this ordinance would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants or the property owners. 
    It is the duty of the City of Peoria to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below the regulatory flood elevation are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this ordinance are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate.

Sec. 20-241. - Floodplain management; appeal board. 
A.  The Floodplain Board of the City of Peoria shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this ordinance 
B.  The Floodplain Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this ordinance. 
C.  In passing upon such applications, the Floodplain Board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this ordinance, and: 
1.  The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
2.  The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
3.  The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner; 
4.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
5.  The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
6.  The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use, which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
7.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
8.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
9.  The safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
10.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and, 
11.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, water system and streets and bridges. 
D.  Upon consideration of the factors of Section 20-241(C) and the purposes of this ordinance, the Floodplain Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance. 
E.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
1.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance coverage, and

Sec. 20-242. - Floodplain management; conditions for variances. 
A.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood elevation, provided the procedures of Sections 20-200, 20-221, 20-222, 20-230, 20-231, 20-232, 20-233, 20-234, 20-235 and 20-236 have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
B.  Variances may be issued for the repair, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed in the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structures continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
C.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
D.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
E.  Variances shall only be issued upon a: 
1.  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; 
3.  Showing that the use cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. This includes only facilities defined in Section 20-205 in the definition of "Functionally Dependent Use"; and, 
4.  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

Sec. 21-321. - Conditional Use Permits. 
A.  Intent. 
1.  Every zoning district contains certain buildings, structures, and uses of land which are normal and complementary to permitted principal uses in the district, but which, by reason of their physical or operational characteristics, influence on the traffic function of adjoining streets or similar conditions, are often unnecessarily incompatible with adjacent activities and uses. It is the intent of this Section to permit conditional uses in appropriate zoning districts, when designed and developed in a manner which ensures maximum compatibility with adjoining uses. It is the purpose of this Ordinance to establish principles and procedures for the development and control of such uses. 
2.  A Conditional Use Permit shall be issued for all designated conditional uses under the Peoria Zoning Ordinance. 
B.  General Regulations. 
1.  Zoning district regulations established elsewhere in this Ordinance specify that certain buildings, structures, and uses of land may be allowed by the Commission as permitted conditional uses in a given district subject to the provisions of this Ordinance and to requirements set forth in the district regulations. 
2.  The Department shall consider any building, structure, or use existing on the effective date of this Ordinance as meeting the requirements and conditions of this Ordinance provided that the building, structure, or use is listed as a Permitted Conditional Use in the applicable zoning district. Continuance of the use shall not require the issuance of a new or additional Conditional Use Permit. However, the Department shall consider a building, structure, or use that fails to conform to the requirements of this Section as non-conforming as described in Section 21-860 and its continuance shall be governed by all non-conformity regulations stipulated in this Ordinance. 
3.  When issued, a Conditional Use Permit shall be applicable only to the specific use and to the specific property for which it is issued. However, once all zoning and site development requirements imposed in connection with the permit have been satisfied and an occupancy permit has been issued, the Conditional Use Permit shall thereafter be transferable and shall run with the land. Thenceforth, maintenance of special conditions imposed by the permit, as well as compliance with other provisions of this Section, shall be the responsibility of the property owner.

Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the official zoning district map which may, from time to time, be made or published, the official zoning district map, which shall be located in the office of the City Clerk, shall be the final authority as to the current zoning status of land area, buildings and other structures in the city. 
C.  Changes. If, in accordance with the provisions of this Section, changes are made in district boundaries or in other matters portrayed on the official zoning district map, such changes shall be made on said map promptly after the amendment has been approved by the Council, together with an entry signed by the City Clerk certifying to the accuracy and date.

E.  Replacement. In the event that the official zoning district map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret due to the nature of number of changes and additions, the Council may, by resolution, adopt a new official zoning district map which shall supersede the former map.

F.  Interpretation. Where, due to scale, lack of detail or illegibility of the official zoning district map, there is an uncertainty, contradiction or conflict as to the intended location of any district boundary shown thereon, the exact location of such boundary shall be determined by the Board, after having received the recommendation of the Commission. The Board, in reaching its determination, shall apply the following standards: 
a.  Zoning district boundary lines are intended to follow lot lines or be parallel or perpendicular thereto, and centerline of streets, alleys, right-of-way, unless otherwise fixed by dimensions shown on the official zoning district map.

Regulations are designed to limit uses to those which are compatible with agriculture, to prevent encroachment by more intensive uses and to preserve the open field characteristic of the district.

NON-RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS 

Sec. 21-501. - Intent. 
    The non-residential districts are intended to collectively facilitate the development and operation of all types of employment-generating uses, including, but not limited to, retail and service establishments, neighborhood convenience stores, business parks and professional offices, research and development centers, storage warehouses and other light-industrial uses in a manner consistent with the Peoria General Plan. 
(Ord. No. 2017-33 , § 89, 6-13-17) 
Sec. 21-502. - Zoning Districts. 
A.  Office Commercial District (O-1). The O-1 District is intended to provide an environment conducive to the establishment of professional offices, medical and legal services, and ancillary retail uses. Certain other types of uses are permitted under conditions and standards that ensure their compatibility with surrounding uses as well as nearby residential districts. The O-1 Districts provide for land use transition between more intensive commercial developments and the less intensive residential neighborhoods. 
B.  Convenience Commercial District (C-1). The C-1 District is intended to accommodate neighborhood-scale retail and service establishments that provide the incidental daily necessities for the local residential areas. This district constitutes the secondary level of neighborhood commercial development. In order to prevent the undesirable "strip" commercial development, it is intended that each development be contiguous and limited in scale. The C-1 Districts should generally be restricted to the intersection of major arterial streets while providing one-mile separation from other non-adjacent commercial districts. The regulations and development standards are designed to preserve adjacent residential amenities and to prohibit encroachment by more intensive commercial uses. 
C.  Planned Neighborhood Commercial District (PC-1). The PC-1 District is intended to accommodate small-scale retail and service establishments that provide the incidental daily necessities for the local residential areas. This district allows for planned neighborhood shopping centers typically having a principal tenant (i.e. supermarket) and an accompanying trade area generally limited to adjacent neighborhoods. It is further intended that PC-1 Districts be restricted to the intersection of selected arterial streets while generally providing one-mile separation from other non-adjacent commercial districts. The regulations and development standards are designed to preserve adjacent residential amenities and to prohibit encroachment by more intensive commercial uses. 
D.  Planned Community Commercial District (PC-2). The PC-2 District is intended to accommodate large-scale planned commercial complexes providing comparison shopping goods and services to a community wide and regional trade area. It is further intended that such commercial centers shall be planned, developed and managed as integrated complexes under unified or condominium ownership. 
E.  Intermediate Commercial District (C-2). The C-2 District is intended to provide a shopping center for the sale of convenience goods and personal services. In order to prevent the establishment of undesirable "strip" commercial development, it is intended that each development be contiguous and limited in scale. The C-2 districts should generally be restricted to the intersection of major arterial streets while providing one-mile separation from other non-adjacent commercial districts. The regulations and development standards are designed to preserve adjacent residential amenities and to prohibit encroachment by more intensive commercial uses. 
F.  Central Commercial District (C-3). The C-3 District is intended to accommodate retail and service establishments in the original plat of Peoria, what is now called the 'Old Town' area. While the C-3 District is intended for buildings to be grouped together in compact arrangements in order to provide maximum shopping convenience and efficient use of off-street parking, the development standards contained herein recognize the existing characteristics of individually owned, small-lot business establishments. The regulations and development standards are designed to preserve adjacent residential amenities and to prohibit encroachment by more intensive commercial uses. 
G.  General Commercial District (C-4). The C-4 District is intended to facilitate a wide range of retail, office, service establishments, and other uses not suitable to be located adjacent to residential zones but necessary to accommodate the larger community. This district is particularly suitable along Grand Avenue and Bell Road where uses are primarily related to auto-borne clientele and by nature, create a high degree of turning movement. 
H.  Regional Commercial District (C-5). The C-5 District is intended to accommodate large-scale commercial establishments or developments that provide goods and services to a community-wide and regional trade area. These districts are typically located along major arterials (typically 110' of right-of-way) or other regional transportation corridors. 
I.  Business Park Industrial District (BPI). The BPI District is intended to accommodate the development of office parks, support retail services, warehousing and certain light industrial uses in a comprehensively planned and attractive setting. The regulations and development standards contained within this district include generous screening, landscape buffering and performance standards to ensure compatibility with neighboring districts, particularly when located near residential districts. 
J.  Planned Light Industrial District (PI-1). The PI-1 District is intended to accommodate certain industrial structures and uses having physical and operational characteristics that might have potential adverse impacts on adjacent properties. The regulations and development standards are designed to permit those industrial uses which can be operated in a relatively clean, quiet and safe manner, and are compatible with adjoining industrial uses without causing adverse impacts, danger or hazard to nearby non-industrial uses. 
K.  Light Industrial District (I-1). The I-1 District is intended to accommodate certain light industrial developments such as manufacturing uses which can be operated in a relatively clean, quiet and safe manner without causing adverse psychological influence or nuisance effects on surrounding property or similar reasons. The regulations and development standards are designed to accommodate, control and limit such special uses for their own protection as well as for protection of the character of surrounding districts. 
L.  Heavy Industrial District (I-2). The I-2 District is intended to accommodate certain industrial structures and uses, including large-scale or very specialized industrial operations, having potential adverse environmental impacts on adjoining residential and commercial developments, and, to some extent, the nearby light industrial districts. The regulations and development standards are structured to permit uses involve processing of raw materials and the manufacturing, processing and compounding of semi-finished or finished products.

SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND DESIGNATIONS 
PLANNED AREA DEVELOPMENT (PAD) 

Sec. 21-601. - Intent. 
A.  The Planned Area Development District (P.A.D.) is intended to provide an alternative zoning district to the conventional zoning and development approaches and processes in the City of Peoria, Arizona in order that within this designated District the following goals may be achieved: 
1.  To enhance the City's development growth in order that the public health, safety, and general welfare be enhanced as Peoria increasingly urbanizes; 
2.  To encourage innovations in residential, commercial, and industrial development so that greater opportunities for better housing, recreation, shopping and employment, may extend to all citizens and residents of Peoria; 
3.  To reflect changes in the technology of land development; 
4.  To encourage a more creative approach in the utilization of land in order to accomplish a more efficient, aesthetic, and desirable development which may be characterized by special features of the geography, topography, size or shape of a particular property; and, 
5.  To provide a compatible and stable developed environment, in harmony with that of the surrounding area. 
The P.A.D. may include any development having one or more principal uses or structures on a single parcel of ground or contiguous parcels. The P.A.D. shall consist of a compatible selection of uses and groupings of buildings, parking areas, circulation and open spaces, and shall be designed as an integrated unit, in such manner as to constitute a safe, efficient, and convenient urban area development. 
(Ord. No. 88-29, 6-28-88; Ord. No. 05-64, 11-15-05; Ord. No. 2017-33 , § 95, 6-13-17)

A.  Conformance with the Peoria General Plan. The land uses and design of the proposed P.A.D. shall be consistent with the Peoria General Plan. The Planning Manager shall not approve or recommend approval of any P.A.D. unless the Planning Manager has received a Waiver of Proposition 207 from the Owner or Owners of the property that is the subject of the P.A.D. or has determined that the absence of such a Waiver of Proposition 207 is consistent with the City's General Plan and zoning goals and regulations. 
B.  P.A.D. Regulations. 
1.  All Planned Area Developments shall be between ten (10) and six-hundred (600) acres in size. The minimum total P.A.D. shall be no less than ten (10) acres unless the applicant can show that the minimum P.A.D. requirements should be waived because the waiver would be in the public interest and that one or more of the following conditions exist: 
a.  Unusual physical features of the property itself or of the surrounding area are such that development under the standard provisions of this Ordinance would not be appropriate in order to conserve a physical or terrain feature of importance to the neighborhood or community. 
b.  The property is adjacent to or across the street or alley from property which has been developed under the provisions of this Section and will contribute to the amenities of the area. 
c.  The use of the P.A.D. concept will encourage the use of otherwise undevelopable property, particularly in the case of small undeveloped parcels surrounded or partially surrounded by developed property. 
d.  The property is located within the Infill Incentive District. 
2.  Waivers of the ten (10) acre minimum requirement may be recommended by the Planning and Zoning Commission, upon a finding that one or more of the above conditions enumerated in paragraph B.1 of this Section exist. 
C.  Uses in a P.A.D. Any use or combination of uses may be allowed in a P.A.D. provided it is consistent with the Peoria General Plan, provided such uses are identified as permitted uses upon approval of the P.A.D.

However, the total number of dwelling units and the resulting density allowed in a P.A.D. shall by consistent with the Land Use Plan of the City's General Plan and the target density framework described therein. 
E.  More Than One Building Per Lot. More than one building may be placed on one platted or recorded lot in any P.A.D. Areas for single family detached dwellings or other housing types providing privately owned lots must comply with the City's Subdivision Ordinance in all respects not specifically noted in Section 21-602 as appropriate variances or waivers. 
F.  One Housing Type Not Inconsistent With Intent. A P.A.D., which only incorporates one housing type such as all detached or all attached units shall not be considered inconsistent with the stated purposes and objectives of this Section and shall not be the sole basis for denial or approval. 
G.  Architectural Style, Appearance. Architectural style of buildings shall not solely be a basis for denial or approval of a plan. However, the overall appearance and compatibility of individual buildings to other site elements or to surrounding development may be considered during P.A.D. review by the Planning and Zoning Commission and Council. 
H.  Phasing of Development. 
1.  Any P.A.D. plan proposed to be constructed in phases shall include full details relating thereto, and the City Council may approve or modify, where necessary, any such proposals.

The uniqueness of each proposal for a P.A.D. may allow specifications and standards for streets, utilities and services to be subject to minor modifications of the specifications and standards established in this and other City ordinances. The plans and profiles of all streets, utilities and services shall be reviewed by the City Engineer prior to the final approval of the P.A.D. 
J.  Additional Standards. Development within a P.A.D. shall conform to all conditions and standards agreed upon by the applicant and the City at time of P.A.D. approval.

The design of the Old Town Mixed-Use Districts aims to promote the following land uses: 
1.  High-quality office, storefront retail, restaurant and entertainment to integrate with various residential components in order to create an urban center where people live, work, and entertain. 
2.  Developments that create a compacted pedestrian environment and promote pedestrian activities that would balance day and night uses. 
3.  Innovative integration of compatible uses through the conversion of existing buildings and the development of new buildings in a manner that fosters sensitive and sustainable site design and architectural style. 
(Ord. No. 04-19, 10-6-04; Ord. No. 2017-33 , § 113, 6-13-17) 
Sec. 21-620. - General Provisions. 
A.  The Old Town Mixed-Use Districts are designed to direct development in the Peoria central core area by allowing complimentary mixtures of commercial, specialized retail, office, and various types of residential developments. Development standards are modified to enhance the urban setting and to encourage private investment. All uses shall be subject to the applicable provisions of the Zoning Ordinance. However, where the regulations and standards established by the Old Town Mixed-Use Districts conflict with other provisions of the ordinance, the regulations and standards set forth in the Old Town Mixed-Use Districts shall govern. 
(Ord. No. 2017-33 , § 114, 6-13-17) 
Sec. 21-621. - Zoning Districts. 
A.  The Old Town Mixed-Use Districts encompass an area within the original town plat of Peoria with Grand Ave to the east, Monroe Street to the south, 85th Ave to the west and Peoria Ave to the north. The Old Town Mixed-Use Districts compose of three zoning districts: Core Commercial Mixed-Use (CCM), Core Residential Mixed-Use (CRM), and Park/Open Space (PO). 
1.  Core Commercial Mixed-Use (CCM). The Commercial Mixed-Use designation allows for retail and service businesses mixed with residential, cultural, educational, community, recreational, entertainment uses. Architecturally enhanced parking structure, street level office, business, or community uses that create a pedestrian friendly environment are strongly encouraged. 
2.  Core Residential Mixed-Use (CRM). The Residential Mixed-Use designation allows for primarily single-family residential uses. Limited types of non-residential uses adapted to the residential structures are permitted in the Residential Mixed-Use area. Non-residential uses may include small-scale entrepreneurial, pedestrian-oriented goods and services, family-owned business, bed and breakfast establishments, and small professional or home business whose business is primarily oriented to users in the Old Town area. 
3.  Park/Open Space (PO). The Park/Open Space designation is reserved for open space, passive recreational activities and support facilities. The Park and Open Space designation also provides venues for seasonal activities and short-term events such as arts and crafts sales, farmers' markets, out-door performances and similar uses in an urban park-like setting. 
(Ord. No. 2017-33 , § 115, 6-13-17) 
Sec. 21-622. - Land Use Matrix. 
A.  Uses permitted in specific zoning districts within the Old Town Mixed-Use Districts as permitted by right, permitted subject to a Conditional Use Permit, and permitted as an accessory to a principal use on the same lot are established in the Mixed Use Land Use Matrix (Table 21-622). In the event of a specific use not being identified on the matrix, the Community Development Director or designee(s) shall determine the closest associated use based on the provisions of this ordinance. The City will permit any accessory use customarily incidental to a permitted principal use on the same lot.

HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY DISTRICT (HDOD) 

Sec. 21-710. - Intent. 
A.  It is the purpose of this Section to establish regulations which recognize that development of hillside areas involves special considerations which result from the slope of the land. These considerations include but are not limited to increased hazards to development from rock falls, storm water runoff, geologic hazards, increased limitations on vehicular travel, and increased difficulties in providing public services. In addition, steeply sloped lands introduce design limitations to roadways, cuts and fills, and building sites. 
B.  The Hillside Development Overlay District is an overlay district that applies to all land wherever the natural terrain of any lot or parcel or any portion thereof has a slope of ten percent (10%) or greater. The application of the Hillside Development Overlay district shall be as depicted below in Table 1, Hillside Determination. 
Table 1
Hillside Determination< 10% slope Non-Hillside = 10% slope Hillside = 5 acres with 50% or more of the site in Hillside Hillside = 5 acres with less than 50% of the site in Hillside Only areas greater than 10% considered Hillside  
C.  All rezoning applications to Planned Community District (PCD) and Planned Area Developments (PAD) shall conform with the provisions of this Section unless expressly modified through an approved PC or PAD District Standards/Guidelines Report and Development Plan. 
D.  Conservation features identified in Section 21-726 shall be preserved in accordance with that Section.

Applicants seeking to utilize an alternative methodology shall provide both a written explanation of the proposed alternative methodology and a graphical example of its use. If, upon review of the proposed alternative Slope Category Determination Study by the Planning Manager, the slope analysis is not acceptable, the applicant shall utilize one of the adopted methodologies contained herein. Appeals of the Planning Manager decision pursuant to this paragraph may be heard by the Administrative Hillside Hearing Officer subject to the provisions of Section 21-311 of this Ordinance. 
E.  To determine parcel density and the location and extent of slope categories, carry out one of the following procedures: 
1.  Manual Slope Determination Method 
a.  Utilize a topographic map at a scale of two hundred (200) feet or less to the inch and with contours shown at two (2) foot intervals. Applicant may utilize maps containing contours at five (5) foot intervals for grades of more than twenty percent (20%). All contour lines shall be extended onto adjacent properties to a distance that establishes the overall slope of the land but in no case shall they be extended less than fifty (50) feet onto the adjacent properties. 
b.  The Hillside Development Area shall commence at the midpoint of the one hundred (100) foot horizontal dimensions used to determine the slope as illustrated by Figure 2, attached hereto and by this reference made a part hereof. The one hundred (100) foot slope determination lines shall be located perpendicular to the site or property contour bands. Those properties containing multiple slope planes should provide slope information for all such planes. 
c.  To determine those locations where slopes of ten percent (10%), fifteen percent (15%), twenty percent (20%), twenty-five percent (25%), thirty percent (30%), and thirty-five percent (35%) begin by the application of one hundred (100) foot straight lines that fall within each category. The one hundred (100) foot slope determination lines shall be extended onto adjacent properties to a distance that establishes the overall slope of the land but in no case shall they be extended less than fifty (50) feet onto the adjacent properties. 
d.  Connect the midpoints of each series of one hundred (100) foot lines of the same slope category to establish the limits of that slope category. 
e.  Measure the areas resulting between each series of straight lines to determine the areas in each slope category. 
f.  Figure 2, attached hereto and by this reference made a part hereof, illustrates the method used in calculating the slope categories. 
2.  Computer Generated Slope Determination Method 
a.  Utilize digital topographic information with contours shown at a maximum of two (2) foot intervals, except as established herein. Areas known or shown to contain slopes of more than twenty percent (20%) may utilize digital topographic information with contours shown at five (5) foot intervals. 
b.  Utilizing a slope generating software application, slope categories shall be determined utilizing the slope categories established in Section 21-711 of this Ordinance. 
c.  Computer generated slope analyses shall be prepared utilizing the following modeling parameters: 
1)  Maximum two (2) foot slope contour intervals for slopes less than twenty percent (20%); 
2)  Maximum five (5) foot slope contour intervals for slopes more than twenty percent (20%); 
3)  The slope analysis shall utilize the above noted slope contour intervals through the modeling basis of grid evaluation to determine slope facets or contours; 
4)  The analysis shall utilize a twenty-five (25) foot grid system. 
d.  All data generated through the use of a computer generated slope determination shall be presented in both chart and graphical formats. Graphical slope information shall be presented in a clear and easily understandable format. 
e.  The final map shall be plotted at a minimum scale of 1" = 200' and submitted to the Department for review. If found acceptable, the final slope determination map shall be approved. The Department may reject the analysis and require correction(s) to the digitized slope category lines to more accurately reflect the generalized slope conditions of the property or other revisions necessary to ensure compliance with this Section. Appeals from the decision of the Department may be filed for disposition by the Administrative Hillside Hearing Officer pursuant to Section 21-311 of this Ordinance. 
3.  The Final Slope Category Map resulting from this Section shall be utilized in determining allowable densities, lot area, lot disturbance and lot coverage requirements. Preliminary Plats shall reflect proposed disturbance/coverage envelopes for each lot and shall contain tabular information necessary to determine compliance with this Section. 
(Ord. No. 05-44, 8-25-05; Ord. No. 07-14, 4-17-07; Ord. No. 2011-08, 3-22-11; Ord. No. 2017-33 , § 141, 6-13-17) 
Sec. 21-713. - Density. 
A.  For all major and minor sub-divisions and for multifamily residential developments, the maximum number of residential lots or units permitted within hillside development areas shall be the sum of the number of lots allowed by the zoning district, or the sum of the number of lots allowed in each slope category of land as shown by Table 2, whichever is the lesser number. 
B.  For all non-residential developments or single-lot construction where density allocation does not apply, the applicant shall comply with all other applicable portions of this Section. 
TABLE 2
DENSITY ALLOCATION Slope of Land Maximum Number of Lots Per Gross Acre 0%-10% Underlying Zoning 10% to 15% 1.50 # 15% to 20% 1.00 # 20% to 25% 0.70 # 25% to 30% 0.50 # 30% to 35% 0.30 35% to 40% 0.20 40% and Over 0.10  
# The allowable density of these slope categories may exceed the Maximum Number of Lots per Gross Acre shown above when density is transferred from a higher slope category. In no case shall the density exceed the sum of the number of lots allowed by the zoning district and in no case shall units be transferred to a location of higher elevation within the project. Plateau geographical features shall be addressed according to slope category and not according to elevation. 
C.  Transfer Rate: Disturbance and dwelling units/development rights that are allowed within preserved public and private open space may be transferred to other parcels within the same development. When all of the allowable dwelling units are transferred from a Hillside Development Area above the ten percent (10%) slope line to a non-hillside development area, resulting in a minimum fifty (50) acre undisturbed area above the ten percent (10%) slope line, the density transfer from the Hillside Development Area to the non-hillside development area may occur at a rate of 1:1.25 allowable dwelling units. 
D.  The transfer of density within a Hillside Development Area shall not be an assumed right and in no case shall a transfer of density occur without the approval of the Planning Manager. Approvals of a density transfer shall be made only upon a finding that the proposed transfer will not be detrimental to the intent of the Hillside Development Overlay District and upon a finding that the transfer will advance the City's interests in protecting a Hillside Development Area.

Sec. 21-714. - General Provisions for Hillside Lots. 
A.  Minimum lot sizes in hillside areas shall be limited as shown in Table 3. Lot sizes in areas of 10% slope or greater may be reduced by up to twenty percent (20%) provided that all dwelling units/development rights have been transferred off of slope categories greater than twenty percent (20%). 
Table 3 Slope Category Minimum Lot Size 0% to 10% Underlying Zoning 10% to 15% 10,000 square feet 15% to 20% 32,000 square feet 20% to 25% 43,560 square feet 25% to 30% 75,000 square feet Over 30% Same as Table 1  
B.  No residential lot within the Hillside Development Overlay District and having slope areas in excess of fifteen percent (15%) shall have a front lot width less than seventy-five (75) feet. The front lot width of all flag lots located within the Hillside Development Overlay District shall be measured from the point at which the drive access intersects with the main body of the lot or at a point not to exceed two hundred and fifty (250) feet from the front lot line of the flag lot. 
C.  Building setbacks shall be as required by the zoning district. 
D.  Maximum lot coverage by the main building and all accessory buildings shall not occupy more than that permitted by the zoning district or Table 4, whichever is the lesser area. 
E.  All hillside lots shall provide an individual analysis of each lot or parcel shall be prepared prior to recording the final plat or minor land division. For existing lots of record as of the date of adoption of this ordinance, an individual site analysis shall be submitted prior to the approval of any development permits or entitlements. Following review and approval of the Slope Category Determination Study by the Department, the individual site analysis shall be submitted in conjunction with a grading and drainage plan. No building permit shall be issued prior to approval of the grading and drainage plan and individual site analysis. 
F.  All lots or parcels which abut a dedicated public open space or preserve area shall provide a one (1) foot non-vehicular access easement along the common property line. 
(Ord. No. 2017-33 , § 143, 6-13-17) 
Sec. 21-715. - Height and Appearances. 
    For development within hillside areas, the height of structures shall be determined by the following Sections and not by the definitions described in Section 21-202 of this Ordinance. 
A.  No part of any structure shall penetrate an imaginary plane, the height of which complies with the underlying zoning district measured vertically from any point outside of the building where the face of the building or support intersects natural ground (see Figure 4). 
B.  Where natural grade is not restored back against the building, no exposed face in any vertical plane shall exceed a height of thirty (30) feet measured from the lowest exposed base. 
C.  Materials used for exterior surfaces of all structures shall blend in color, hue and tone with the surrounding natural setting to avoid high contrasts. 
1.  Structures, walls, roofs and fences shall blend with the surrounding terrain and there shall be no material or colors used which have an LRV (Light Reflecting Value) greater than forty percent (40%). Mirror surfaces, or any treatment which changes ordinary glass into a mirror surface is prohibited. Bright untarnished copper or other metallic surfaces shall be treated at the time of installation so they are non-reflective. 
2.  All electrical service equipment and subpanels and all mechanical equipment including, but not limited to, air conditioning and pool equipment, shall not be visible from outside the property when viewed from the same or a lower elevation. For the sake of functionality, solar panels and solar water heaters shall be exempt from screening requirements. It is recommended, however, that to the extent feasible, the frames and support structures for these elements should be painted to match the principal building on the property or be integrated into the building and/or landscape design. 
3.  Water storage facilities, pumping station, and related facilities shall be designed to minimize their visual impact. All such facilities shall be painted to match the predominant color of the natural terrain, disturbed terrain shall be dyed to blend with surrounding area, and walls shall be contextually sensitive in terms of color and materials. Additional screening techniques are provided in order of preference in the list below. Final designs must be approved by the Public Works Director or designee.

(Ord. No. 2017-33 , § 144, 6-13-17) 
Sec. 21-716. - Disturbed Area Calculations for Individual Hillside Lots. 
    Lots shall be developed to provide for the minimum amount of ground disturbance during the time of construction so as to prevent rock slides and falls, erosion and seepage. At final construction, disturbed areas shall be hidden or supported by retaining walls, buildings, finished surfaces or restored and landscaped to its original natural condition to the extent possible. All cut and fill areas visible from off-site locations shall be treated with a natural staining or aging agent. 
A.  Hillside properties north of Pinnacle Peak Road must also comply with Section 21-726 Desert Lands Conservation Overlay. 
B.  All buildings, structures, and roads shall to the fullest extent practicable, utilize the natural contours of the land so as to minimize the disturbed area. 
C.  Disturbed areas may be reclaimed if they are restored to their natural contours, vegetation and colors, and shall reflect the natural condition as depicted in historical aerial photos and site photos taken prior to the development of the site. 
D.  The maximum height of any cut or fill used to establish a building site or a driveway shall not exceed fifteen (15) feet and must comply with the provisions of the Peoria Building Codes. The maximum height of any cut or fill used to establish a road or roadway shall not exceed thirty (30) feet. All areas of cut or fill necessary to establish a public or private roadway and falling outside of the public right-of-way or private roadway easement shall be counted against the total disturbed lot area of the individual lot or parcel. All roadway cuts shall be re-vegetated and all roadway fills shall utilize retaining walls to minimize spill areas. All spill slope areas shall be re-vegetated and all retaining walls shall be designed to minimize their visual impacts. 
E.  The limits of construction and proposed disturbed areas shall be clearly delineated on the property prior to and during construction with visible roping and shall conform to the approved individual site analysis plan. No disturbance outside the designated area shall take place. 
F.  All lots less than 18,000 square feet net area are eligible for mass grading. 
G.  All lots equal to or greater than 18,000 square feet net area shall establish a construction envelope equal to the combined area of the maximum disturbed area and maximum lot coverage from Table 4, below. 
H.  All surplus excavated material shall be removed from the lot. 
I.  Up to ten percent (10%) of the gross land area above the ten percent (10%) slope line may be used for roadways (public and private) that shall not be included in disturbed area calculations. The disturbed area and roadways and driveways (that exceed the 10% roadway allowance), storm water retention areas and accessory use areas, shall not exceed the total disturbed area as set forth in Table 4. 
Table 4 Slope Category Disturbed Area Maximum Lot
Coverage Total Disturbed Area 10% to 15% 25% 30% 55% 15% to 20% 20% 25% 45% 20% to 25% 20% 20% 40% 25% to 30% 15% 15% 30% 30% to 35% 12% 10% 22% 35% + 10% 7.5% 17.5%  
J.  Calculation of Disturbed Area (Table 4): 
1.  The Total Disturbed Area for each individual development or development parcel shall be the sum of the amount of Disturbed Area allowed within each of the individual slope categories found on the development parcel and the Maximum Coverage. 
2.  Disturbed Area accounts for site elements such as driveways, non-natural/un-restored landscaping, pool areas, walkways, uncovered patios, etc. 
3.  Maximum Lot Coverage refers to any under-roof site element and shall include principal and accessory buildings. 
K.  Transfer of Disturbed Area and dwelling units/development rights to a lower slope category shall be subject to the following conditions: 
1.  Permitted Lot Coverage and Disturbed Area from a higher slope category may be transferred to the next lower slope category within the site/parcel provided the transferred-to category does not exceed its allowable disturbed area. In the event that the transfer would cause the lower category to exceed its allowable disturbed area, the remaining portion of the transferred square footage may be transferred to the next lower category. This pattern may be repeated until all hillside categories have attained their respective allowable disturbed area. Transfers below the 10% slope line are not permitted. 
2.  Permitted Disturbed Areas shall not be transferred from the 0-10% slope category to any other category. 
3.  After any applicable transfers of Disturbed Areas have been calculated, the Total disturbed Area, which includes Lot Coverage, within the 10% - 25% slope categories as indicated in Table 4, may be combined to produce a "bucket" of disturbable square footage. This "bucket" may be distributed throughout the 10% - 25% slope categories at the applicant's discretion (Figure 1). 
4.  Approvals of a disturbed area transfer shall be made only upon a finding that the proposed transfer will not be detrimental to the intent of the Hillside Development Overlay District and upon a finding that the transfer will advance the City's interests in protecting a Hillside Development Area. 
5.  The location of the Disturbed Area and the allocation of Disturbed Area among parcels or lots shall require approval of the Planning Manager or designee; such approval shall be made upon a finding that: 
a.  The proposed location will not be detrimental to the intent of the Hillside Development Overlay District and, to the maximum extent feasible, is located in the lowest slope categories; 
b.  The difference of allocated Disturbed Area does not vary by more than twenty percent (20%) among lots of comparable size and location; 
c.  The resulting change in Disturbed Area on an individual lot does not interfere with the preservation of Natural Open Space; 
d.  The resulting change in Disturbed Area does not result in more cuts into hillside slopes above the twenty percent (20%) slope line or changes in contours that will remain unrestored; 
e.  The location will advance the City's interest in protecting a Hillside Development Area; and 
f.  The development or development parcel is otherwise in compliance with this Section. 
Figure 1 - Overview of Steps For Hillside Development 
Step 1: 
Identify slope categories and square footage of each category on property 
Step 2: 
Calculate density, permitted disturbed area and lot coverage per category using Tables 2 and 4 
Step 3: 
Develop property accordingly OR Proceed to Step 4 
Step 4: 
Transfer density or Total Lot Coverage to lower slope categories until such categories are at capacity 
Step 5: 
Combine Disturbed Area and Lot Coverage (in square feet) within the 10-15%, 15-20% and 20-25% slope categories to create a virtual "bucket" 
Step 6: 
Distribute the "bucket" as needed with in the 10-15%, 15-20% and 20-25% slope categories 
L.  In those cases where an increase in the maximum lot coverage is desired due to a transfer of density, the maximum lot coverage shall only be increased on the parcels receiving density transferred from a higher slope area. In those cases where all of the density has been transferred from a higher slope category to lower slope areas, all parcels or portions thereof within those slope categories may utilize the increased lot coverage allowance. 
M.  A Disturbed Area (up to 50% over Table 3, for slope areas over 10%) may be excluded from Disturbed Area calculations when the applicant has committed to comply with the following restoration conditions: 
1.  The restored area shall be re-contoured to match pre-existing contours. 
2.  The restored area shall be re-vegetated to its pre-development condition utilizing native plant types arranged and placed at a density matching the surrounding native desert. 
3.  The restoration area shall be treated with an aging agent approved by the Planning Manager and restored with indigenous desert material. 
4.  The restoration plan and process shall be prepared by a registered engineer or landscape architect and shall be approved prior to issuance of a building permit.

DESERT LANDS CONSERVATION OVERLAY (DLCO) 

Sec. 21-725. - Intent. 
    The purpose of the Desert Lands Conservation Overlay (DLCO) is to identify and protect the unique and environmentally sensitive Sonoran Desert lands in the City and to promote the public health, safety and welfare by providing appropriate and reasonable controls for the development of such lands. Specifically the lands are located north of Pinnacle Peak Road. The DLCO is intended to: 
A.  Identify sensitive desert conservation features and resources. 
B.  Protect and preserve Peoria's distinctive desert landscapes and wildlife habitats for the enjoyment of current and future generations. 
C.  Protect people and property from hazardous conditions characteristic of environmentally sensitive lands and their development. 
D.  Integrate conservation design into the development of sensitive desert lands and employ development standards and guidelines that equitably balance conservation and development objectives. 
In addition, the DLCO is intended to implement the goal, policies and objectives of the Desert Lands Conservation Master Plan (DLCMP). The overlay establishes a holistic approach to evaluating the environmental conditions of each site that allows both City staff and the development community a better basis for determining conservation areas. The overlay also establishes criteria for determining conservation priorities based on the potential to expand or extend a regional open space corridor, the opportunity to provide a link to an existing or future trail system, the possibility of expanding an existing open space, or the possibility of creating a buffer zone between different intensities of uses. 
The DLCO not only preserves sensitive and unique desert features, but also native plants and plant communities in order to enhance the City's aesthetic appeal by conserving distinctive scenic character. Native plant communities are also preserved because they thrive in the local desert environment and provide soil stabilization to fragile desert soils, stabilization that is lost after development activity that disturbs plants and top soil layers. Canopied plants such as mesquite provide nurturing shade and protection for lower level plants. Native plants identified for preservation are chosen on the basis of their slow growth habit, the fact that the plant alone or in combination with others provides unique wildlife habitat and soil stabilization support, its rarity in this environment, and its proven success rate for salvage in this region. 
Finally, the DLCO establishes standards and design guidelines for development within desert areas and adjacent to conservation areas. These regulations and guidelines vary by landform type in order to address the three distinctive types of geography (Desert Floor, Bajada and Hillside) found in the Peoria desert areas. The classification system assumes a single vegetation type in Peoria, Lower Sonoran, consisting of creosote, bursage, and saltbush associations. The DLCO is to be applied in conjunction with the 2003 International Urban-Wildland Interface Code (IUWIC). In cases where there is conflicting provisions, the IUWIC will take precedence. 
(Ord. No. 04-201, 10-6-04; Ord. No. 2017-33 , § 154, 6-13-17) 
Sec. 21-726. - Applicability. 
A.  The Desert Lands Conservation Overlay (DLCO) establishes a special overlay zoning district, which applies to specific resources and environmental conditions north of Pinnacle Peak Road. In order to accomplish the purpose of this district, the City of Peoria shall apply these provisions to these lands that contain any of the following special conservation features and resources: 
B.  Conservation Features: 
1.  Cultural Resource. Prehistoric and historic sites identified according to standards established by the State Historic Preservation Office. Includes artifacts such as rock walls, etc. 
2.  Isolated Peak. The prominent peaks which jut out of a typically flatland area. These are landmark features whose rugged vertical form contrasts sharply with the horizontal ground plain. 
3.  Mountainous Area. Areas such as the Hieroglyphic Mountain Range which include numerous peaks, rugged topography, steep slopes and small v-bottomed washes flowing out of the area. The limits of a mountainous area is established when more than 60% of the area has slopes of 25% or greater. 
4.  Plateau. An extensive land area characterized by slopes leading to a relatively level surface and situated at a uniformly higher elevation than adjacent land on at least one side. 
5.  Primary Peak. Prominent peaks that are visual landmarks from various points of view and rise at least 400 feet above the surrounding base elevation. 
6.  Riparian Vegetation. Native vegetation that grows where there is a concentration of sustainable drainage water resulting in larger plants, greater species diversity and greater density. Generally lines washes, rivers, tanks and springs. 
7.  Riverine Area. Environmentally diverse riparian areas associated with the New River and Aqua Fria Rivers and Major Washes. 
8.  Rock/Boulder Formation. Formations including escarpments, cliffs or pinnacles which consist of exposed rock faces with limited vegetative cover. 
9.  Significant Vegetation Area. A stand of Sonoran Desert vegetation that is thirty percent more concentrated than the general aspect of the immediate context area and difficult to salvage due to slope, rocky soil conditions or exposed roots due to an adjacent wash. Generally located adjacent to a wash or other source of water and maintains the character of the site best when protected in place. 
10.  Significant Vegetation Specimen. A native tree with an 8" or greater caliper trunk and multi-trunk in good health, a saguaro over 20 feet in height and/or multiple arms or crest or other unusual configuration in good health, or other mature protected species, such as Ocotillo. 
11.  Skyline Ridge. Ridge lines and ridge line complexes which are visible from existing and/or planned collector and arterial roads, have an elevation difference of a maximum of three hundred (300) vertical feet from the property line of the subject parcel, have a vertical height increase of more than three hundred (300) feet as measured from the point of the ten percent (10%) slope line of the ridge or ridge complex, are composed primarily of a cliff face with a total height of at least 50 feet measured from the base of the cliff, or are determined by Staff to be significant during the site analysis process. 
12.  Spring. A permanent small stream or source of water coming out of the ground. 
13.  Talus Slope. A slope strewn with a layer of loose rock debris, usually over unconsolidated soils. 
14.  Unstable Slope. A slope that exhibits one or more of the following conditions. boulder collapse, boulder rolling, rock falls, slope collapse and talus slopes. 
15.  Wash, Major. Washes that by their size are more riverine in character than washes. They are characterized by extraordinary depth and width, strewn rock and vegetative rubble, diversity, density and sizes of vegetation and volumes of water that they can accommodate. Major washes include Morgan City Wash, Big Spring Wash and Twin Buttes Wash. Maximum flow capacity exceeds 500 cubic feet per second. 
16.  Wash, Primary. Wide, sand bottom washes that carry drainage from a relatively broad watershed and are fed by a number of smaller tributary washes. These washes generally have dense thickets of tree and shrub vegetation along their edges and are easily identified from aerial photographs. Maximum flow capacities are between 20 and 500 cubic feet per second. 
17.  Wash, Secondary. Tributaries to the significant washes and the rivers. The majority of these washes are the finger washes, which occur between slopes in the rugged areas. They have narrow sand bottoms or are V-shaped. There is increased vegetation density along these washes but the vegetation is more in the large shrub category. Maximum flow capacities are up to 20 cubic feet per second. 
18.  Wildlife Corridor. Pathways or habitat linkages that connect discrete areas of natural open space otherwise separated or fragmented by topography, changes in vegetation, and other natural factors in combination with urbanization, and which 1) permit animals to move between remaining habitats allowing depleted populations to be replenished and promoting genetic exchange; 2) provide escape routes from fire, predators, and human disturbances, thus reducing the risk that catastrophic events, such as fire or disease, will result in population or species extinction; 3) serve as travel paths for individual animals as they wander throughout their home ranges in search of food, water, mates, and other needs, or for dispersing juveniles in search of new home ranges. 
19.  Wildlife Habitat. Locations where native wildlife has a tendency to congregate due to provision of food, shelter and/or water.

    Desert Lands Conservation Report (DLCR). A submittal required with any development application to the City for property within the Desert Lands Conservation Overlay, and which contains the following individual documents: Project Identification and Descriptive Data, Project Narrative and Overview, and Existing Conditions Data Report. 
    Destroy. To kill, or cause the death of any protected native plant by any means. 
    Developer. The property owner or his representative that is undertaking the development of land subject to the Desert Lands Conservation Overlay District. 
    Disturbed Area. That area of natural ground that has been or is proposed to be altered through grading, construction, cut and fill, removal of natural vegetation, placement of material, trenching, or by any means that causes a change in the undisturbed natural surface of the land or natural vegetation. The Disturbed Area is coterminous with the Disturbed Area identified in the Hillside Development Overlay District of this code and shall be subject to the same requirements of that Section. 
    Disturbed Area, Reclaimed. Disturbed areas that have been restored to their natural contours, vegetation and colors to the satisfaction of the City of Peoria. 
    Fill. The deposition of soil, rock or other materials place by man. 
    Finished Grade. The final grade and elevation of the ground surface after grading is completed. 
    Grade, Natural. The elevation through any section of a site on an undisturbed lot at the time of adoption of this overlay by City Council. On lots that have been disturbed previously, the natural grade is the pre-existing grade if it can be determined; otherwise it shall be determined by an average of off-site elevations at points taken around the boundary of the site. All determinations shall have been made by an engineer or land surveyor licensed to practice in the state of Arizona. 
    Grading. Any excavating, or filling or combination thereof, including the conditions resulting from an excavation or fill. 
    Habitat Value. The suitability of the landscape to support wildlife, considering site conditions. Suitability shall be ascertained by comparing similar sites and conditions and may require returning the habitat as closely to its original condition as possible when natural conditions have been changed. 
    Landform Type. 
  Bajada Landform Type. Characterized as the irregular terrain near or at the base of mountain ridges or isolated mountain outcrops. This area is located in the transition zone between the Desert Floor and the Hillside landform types and exhibits relatively high vegetation density and diversity. The lower portions of alluvial fans dominated by palo verde and mixed cacti vegetation typify this area, such as the bases of low mountain ranges. Saguaro is a visually dominant and important component of this area. Higher density and diversity of vegetation results in higher wildlife density and diversity that is dispersed between both wash and upland areas. It is comprised primarily of bedrock materials with land slopes generally in the range of ten (10) to fifteen (15) percent. Drainage courses are typically well incised. Typical hazards include boulder rolling, rock falls, debris movement and general slope instability. The surface movement of materials occurs as a result of both gravity and water transport. The surface material size includes large boulders, rocks and gravel, as well as grainy soil materials. 
  Desert Floor Landform Type. Characterized in general by level plains and expanses that typically occupy the broad lowlands floodplains between desert mountain ranges. The area is dominated by low growing shrubs, such as creosote and bursage, and supports larger shrubs and trees, such as palo verde and ironwood, and cacti, such as saguaro. Because the uplands support a greater diversity and density of plants, wildlife density and diversity are higher and important wildlife resources occur in both wash and upland areas. The terrain is relatively flat, with typical slopes of less than five (5) percent, although the slope of this landform classification extends up to ten (10) percent. Soils are generally deep and alluvial. The more numerous smaller washes that are found in more sloped areas are consolidated into fewer, but larger washes. Because of the flatter terrain, streambeds are typically sandy bottomed, wide braided channels that carry high volumes of floodwaters. 
  Hillside Landform Type. Consists of the higher elevation rugged areas, with relatively steep slope and high vegetation density and diversity. These areas include mountains, hills, buttes, or escarpments predominantly composed of bedrock materials. The slope is greater than fifteen (15) percent, and in many cases is greater than thirty-five (35) percent. Upper portions of alluvial fans and the foothills of low mountains dominated by palo verde and mixed cacti vegetation typify this area. The saguaro is a visually dominant and important component of this area and higher density and diversity of vegetation results in higher wildlife density and diversity. Streambeds are typically narrow, rocky and incised. Drainage courses are relatively poorly defined on the slopes, but collect into deep canyon bottom courses strewn with large-sized rubble. Typical hazards include boulder rolling, rock falls, debris movement and general slope instability. Soils are generally shallow and rocky. Cultural resource sites are smaller and more scattered. There are a greater number of petroglyphs and few sites related to prehistoric agricultural uses. 
    Landscape Character Zone. An association of plants that create an identifiable landscape character, and further defined by specific plant palettes found in the Desert Lands Conservation Guide. 
  Native Sonoran Zone. Landscape character zone that represents indigenous plants typically found in the desert of the northern Phoenix metropolitan areas. 
  Sonoran Character Zone. Landscape character zone with an associated plant list which represents plants that are generally native to the southwest deserts or have the appearance of being native to those deserts. 
  Arid Character Zone. Landscape character zone where plants are generally compatible with the look of an arid landscape. The associated plant list is a broader representation of drought tolerant plants and includes non-natives that are considered appropriate for the area. 
  Exotic Zone. Landscape character zone where plants are permitted which are not included on the other landscape character zone lists, as long as they are not on the prohibited plants list. The use of these plants is limited to Oasis Landscape Development Areas and areas included in the Disturbed Area. 
    Landscape Development Areas. Areas within a site with different recommended plant palettes based on their proximity to natural open space, soil stabilization attributes and the desired visual character for the area. 
  Oasis Area. A landscaped area consisting of enclosed courtyards, similar semi-private areas and other areas located within the Disturbed Area where the use of Native Sonoran, Sonoran Character and Arid Zone plants are strongly encouraged, but where Exotic Zone plants are also allowed. 
  Transitional Areas. A landscaped area consisting of open backyards, commercial and public areas, streetscapes and common areas where use of Arid Zone plants is limited to 30% by area and where a buffer of Native Sonoran Zone plants is required at the perimeter of the lot or parcel or between the Disturbed Area and Natural Open Space. 
  Buffer Area. A landscaped area consisting of open areas adjacent to preserved wash corridors and natural open space areas where the use of plants is limited to the Native Sonoran Zone palette. 
    Master Conservation Plan (MCP). A submittal required with any site plan or subdivision plat application to the City for property within the Desert Lands Conservation Overlay, and which contains the identification of conservation features, native plants to be preserved, development areas, and conservation areas. 
    Mature Trees. Healthy, full-bodied trees with a shape characteristic of the species and of the following minimum sizes: Ten (10) feet-twelve (12) feet height times six (6) inches-eight (8) inches wide or two-inch single trunk caliper or one-inch average trunk caliper for a multiple trunk tree. 
    Mutilate. To deface, maim, damage or disfigure any protected native plant by shooting, chopping, pushing over, burning, cutting or any other means. 
    Native Plant Permit. A permit issued by the city pursuant to the provisions of this Section for the purpose of removing from the premises, relocating on the premises, or destroying any protected native plant.

    Plant Protection. Any project which affects any indigenous plant from the specified Protected Native Plant List is required to submit a Native Plant Preservation Plan detailing the existing location and proposed treatment of each protected plant. Protected plants should, at the most optimal situation, remain in place. 
    Plant Salvaging. Those plants which must be disturbed due to construction are required to be salvaged unless the applicant can demonstrate how conditions such as poor health or orientation make successful relocation impossible. Salvaged plants are to be replanted within the project. 
    Private Buffer. An area located adjacent to a public or private preserve open space edge that is used as an undisturbed or enhanced landscape setback. The buffer may be platted as common open space for the development or as individual lots. The area shall contain no improvements or be used for any purpose other than a landscaped setback.

D.  Desert Lands Conservation Report. A comprehensive report shall be submitted as part of a rezoning, platting site plan or building permit request that reviews existing conditions and site and project characteristics. For projects larger than 10 acres, this shall be the Desert Lands Conservation Report (DLCR). Projects of 10 acres or less may submit a Master Conservation Plan (MCP), as specified in this Section in order to meet this requirement. If a development request is being proposed on a property for which an existing DLCR is on file with the City, the Planning Manager shall determine what information, if any, needs to be updated. 
A request to modify some or all of the submittal requirements listed in this Section may be submitted to and approved by the Planning Manager based upon a finding that sufficient information will be provided to make a determination as to compliance with the provisions of the DLCO. 
A narrative description of the proposed development and information included on exhibits shall be submitted as the essential document of the report. The DLCR shall contain information specified in the Desert Lands Conservation Guide. 
E.  Master Conservation Plan. In addition to the DLCR, a Master Conservation Plan (MCP) shall be submitted at the time of site plan or preliminary subdivision plat review and shall consist of the following items. For phased projects, submittal requirements shall correspond to the areas included in each phase. For projects of 10 acres or less submitting only the MCP, identification and descriptive data required for the DLCR and Projective Narrative and Overview shall also be included. Submittal requirements for the MCP are found in the Desert Lands Conservation Guide. 
F.  Site Inspection. For those sites with particularly complex conditions, the City may arrange for a site inspection of the property by the City. The applicant shall distribute copies of the Existing Conditions Data Report for the on-site meeting. Applicants, their site designers, and the landowner will participate in the site inspection. The purpose of this visit is to review the property's existing conditions and special features, to identify potential site design issues, and to provide an informal opportunity to discuss site design concepts, including the prioritization of conservation features, and possible locations for buildings and street alignments. 
G.  Approval Process. The Planning and Zoning Commission or the City Council shall review and either approve or disapprove any DLCR and/or MCP that is submitted as part of a development request requiring approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission or the City Council. The Planning Manager or his/her designee shall review and either approve or disapprove a DLCR and/or MCP for development request requiring building permit, site plan or subdivision plat approval. Appeals of the decision(s) regarding a DLCR and/or MCP will be addressed in the same manner as the development request which it accompanies. Approvals of the DLCR shall be valid for the same period of time accorded to the accompanying development request After a period of one year from the submittal date of the MCP the Planning Manager shall determine the continued sufficiency of the MCP for future development planning applications. The Planning Manager shall not approve or recommend approval of any DLCR and/or MCP unless the Planning Manager has received a Waiver of Proposition 207 from the Owner or Owners of the property that is the subject of the DLCR and/or MCP or has determined that the absence of such a Waiver of Proposition 207 is consistent with the City's General Plan and zoning goals and regulations.

Note: 
? Usable Open Space requirements of this Section may be satisfied by NOS containing dedicated trails, floodway areas or reserved or dedicated steep slope areas. 
2.  The required NOS shall be comprised of the conservation features listed and defined in this Section. If the total acreage of these elements does not meet the minimum NOS requirements, then areas with 25% or greater slope shall be added in such a manner as to expand or extend the NOS until the required percentage is achieved. If after incorporating all areas with slopes of 25% or greater and the minimum NOS requirement is still not met, then additional open space shall be provided in the following priority: 
a.  Expands or extends a regional open space corridor; 
b.  Increases the size of an existing or adjacent open space area; 
c.  Creates a linkage to an existing or planned trail; or, 
d.  Provides a public access point to existing or planned natural open space. 
3.  In the event that the combined area of all required NOS exceeds the maximum required acreage, the following criteria listed in priority order shall be used to guide the determination of which features shall be preserved: 
a.  Conservation Features; 
b.  Land that expands or extends a regional open space or drainage corridor; 
c.  Land that abuts existing and/or planned open space; 
d.  Land that allows opportunity to provide a link to existing or future trail systems; and, 
e.  Land that provides a non-motorized access route from the nearest public right-of-way to an open space area.

5.  The minimum horizontal dimension for NOS is seventy-five (75) feet. 
6.  Where the minimum finished lot size is twenty-four thousand (24,000) square feet or less, NOS shall not be allowed on individual lots and must be placed in common tracts. 
7.  If land designated as NOS is located in a common tract owned by a homeowners association, the property shall be maintained through a common maintenance agreement. 
8.  Any NOS being considered for dedication to the City of Peoria, regardless of size and location, will be reviewed by the Community Services Director and staff for a recommendation as to the acceptance or rejection of the dedication. 
9.  Whether the NOS is located on individual lots or in common tracts, the boundaries of Disturbed Areas shall be delineated in the field with permanent markers in order to prevent encroachment into NOS areas. 
10.  Areas not specifically identified as Disturbed Area or NOS shall be considered Transition Areas. 
11.  Identification of NOS shall be coordinated with the Peoria Hillside Overlay District, Section 21-710, and the planning of NOS shall specifically consider transfer of density and disturbed area. For Hillside Areas, NOS shall be located in areas planned to be undisturbed. 
12.  Within areas identified as NOS, no grading or other disturbance shall occur except the minimum grading required for trails, roadways and utility easements. No walls are permitted within the NOS.

13.  For residential lots, the area between the buildings and the street and, for lots in excess of 24,000 square feet in size, side yard setback areas not utilized for driveways or parking areas shall be improved with landscaping using indigenous plant materials and groundcovers in addition to the NOS. In addition: 
a.  Perimeter walls or privacy walls shall be allowed in accordance with the provisions of Section 21-710; and, 
b.  The location of all buildings shall be within the delineated boundaries of the Disturbed Area. 
14.  Developments abutting any public NOS shall provide an access plan for public entry onto the NOS. The plan may take into consideration all points of visual and physical access to the NOS from any public or private property. A minimum of 40% of the linear distance along the edge of any public NOS shall consist of one or a combination of the following: 
a.  A public or private street; 
b.  A public or private improved open space having public access with minimum dimensions of 100 feet in length and 75 feet in depth along the NOS; 
c.  A minimum length of 100 feet along the frontage of a public or private street directly connecting the NOS to the street; 
d.  A termination of a public or private street in a configuration that provides on-street parking for four (4) vehicles and sufficient width for maneuvering; or, 
e.  An equivalent creative alternative as approved by the City that provides visual and physical access and results in diversity of the edge treatment. 
15.  The total length of lots backing up to the NOS shall not exceed 1,000 feet without incorporating one of the edge treatments described in this Section or providing a trail access point to the NOS. 
B.  Rivers and Washes. 
1.  All Washes shall be preserved in an undisturbed condition and the habitat value preserved in its original condition. Secondary Washes having no vegetation or plants being preserved in place may be altered or eliminated. 
2.  An undisturbed area of twenty-five (25) feet measured from the edge of riparian vegetation or the floodplain, whichever is greater, shall be preserved on both sides of a Wash that has a one hundred-year peak flow greater than seven hundred (700) cfs. 
3.  If a Wash has a one hundred-year peak flow of less than seven hundred (700) cfs, the area to remain undisturbed should be determined by a width sufficient to allow for wildlife passage outside of the incised wash. 
4.  No major structural changes or improvements shall be allowed in preserved Washes. Protected plants shall be left in place except as follows: 
a.  To prevent erosion from channelization or combination of smaller washes; 
b.  To allow wash crossings of roadways, trails and utility easements. Trails and utilities may cross washes, but in no way shall they be placed in the wash bed running within and parallel to the wash bottom. Public utility easements shall be restored when construction is completed; 
c.  To prevent wash migration, where structures are placed behind the required wash setback; and, 
d.  To allow discharge from adjacent retention or drainage facilities, as approved by the City Engineer as part of a drainage system improvement plan resulting from a drainage study performed by an engineer registered in the state of Arizona. 
C.  Wildlife Habitat. 
1.  Corridors shall be established along both sides of washes identified for conservation which include the estimated 100-year floodplain and an additional upland buffer of 25 feet or the outer edge of the erosion hazard zone, if identified in a map as part of a drainage system improvement plan resulting from a drainage study performed by an engineer registered in the state of Arizona, whichever is greater. Non-motorized trails shall be permitted within the upland buffer. 
2.  Linear utility lines shall be placed parallel to, but just outside, the conserved wash and associated upland buffer to provide a more gradual transition to developed areas. Utility lines shall be buried in accordance with the City of Peoria Infrastructure Development Guidelines and restored using indigenous plants so that there is no net loss of habitat function or value. 
D.  Scenic Resources. 
1.  A scenic corridor of 100 feet, measured from the edge of floodplain, shall be established along both sides of the Agua Fria River within which the immediate foreground is kept intact with native or enhanced desert vegetation and no structures are permitted, except for those associated with utilities, stormwater management, and roadways. 
2.  Scenic corridor buffers, measured from edge of right-of-way, of 50 feet within the Rural Section, 30 feet within the Suburban Section, and 15 feet within the Urban Section, shall be established along both sides of the Lake Pleasant Parkway Corridor within which the immediate foreground is kept intact with native or enhanced desert vegetation and no structures are permitted, except those associated with utilities, stormwater management, and roadways. The limits of the Rural, Suburban, and Urban Sections are shown on Figure 4, Development Section Map, of The Lake Pleasant Parkway Corridor Specific Area Plan dated March 6, 2000, as may be amended. 
E.  Cultural Resources. 
1.  Preliminary Archaeological Site Review. Provide a letter report, to be submitted with the Existing Conditions Data Report, from the Arizona State Museum, the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO), or an Archaeologist that reviews all of the available archaeological information for the site. This record check shall: determine whether the site has been field surveyed for cultural resources; 
a.  Identify any previously-recorded archaeological or historic resources known to exist on the property; 
b.  State the probability that buried archaeological resources not visible from the surface would be discovered on the site; and, 
c.  Make a recommendation as to whether an archaeological survey of the site is needed. 
2.  Archaeological Survey; Duties of the Archaeologist. If an archaeological survey of the site is recommended then the following tasks shall be completed by an Archaeologist. 
a.  Complete a field survey and submit the results with the Existing Conditions Data Report. Any cultural resources identified shall be entered by the Archaeologist making the discovery into the Arizona State Museum site file system. 
b.  Describe and map archaeological and historic sites identified on the property in either the records check or the field survey. Detailed location maps of such sites should not be included in the site analysis, but should be available from the Archaeologist for staff review as necessary. 
c.  The Archaeologist shall complete an archaeological report that: 
i.  Determines the significance of the reported cultural resource(s); 
ii.  Assesses the impact of the proposed development on the cultural resource(s). If the resource cannot be preserved in place or protected by acceptable means, it must be mitigated; 
iii.  Makes a determination that the cultural resource must be either preserved/ protected or mitigated; 
iv.  Identifies mitigation measures and a mitigation plan that have been reviewed and approved by the City and/or SHPO. 
3.  Any proposed mitigation measures shall be reviewed and approved by SHPO, having primary responsibility, and/or the City, as the Certified Local Government with jurisdiction, prior to the commencement of any activity on the site. 
F.  Native Plants.

Footnotes:

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2018-08 , § 2(Exh. A), adopted March 6, 2018, repealed the former §§ 21-827-21-855, and enacted a new §§ 21-827-21-837 as set out herein. The former sections pertained to similar subject matter. 

Sec. 21-827. - Applicability. 
    Any sign erected, altered, or maintained after the effective date of this Section, referred to herein as the Sign Code or Section, shall conform to the following regulations within Sections 21-827 through 21-837 of the Zoning Ordinance. Where other regulations apply, such as property located within an approved Planned Area Development (PAD) or Planned Community District (PCD), or where property is subject to an approved Comprehensive Sign Plan (CSP) existing at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance, the time, place and manner provisions of said PAD, PCD, or CSP shall apply. Whenever an approved PAD, PCD or CSP is silent on a matter relating to signage, the provisions of this Section shall apply to the extent that such provisions are not in conflict with the provisions of the approved PAD, PCD, or CSP. 
(Ord. No. 2018-08 , § 2(Exh. A), 3-6-18) 
Sec. 21-828. - Purpose. 
    Signs perform an important function in identifying and promoting properties, businesses, services, residences, events, and other matters of interest to the public; however; they may obstruct views, distract motorists, displace alternative uses for land, and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation. 
A.  The purpose of this Section is to regulate the size, color, illumination, movement, materials, location, height and condition of signs placed on private property for exterior observation, thus ensuring the stability of the community, the character of the various neighborhoods, the creation of a convenient, attractive and harmonious community, protection against destruction of or encroachment on historic convenience to citizens, and encouraging economic development. This Section allows adequate communication through signage while encouraging aesthetic quality in the design, location, size and purpose of all signs. This Section must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. 
B.  The intent of this Section is to regulate signs within the City of Peoria to ensure that they are appropriate for their context, in keeping with the appearance of the affected property and surrounding environment, and protective of the public health, safety, and general welfare. These regulations do not regulate every form and instance of visual communication that may be displayed anywhere within the jurisdictional limits of the City of Peoria. 
C.  A sign placed on land or on a building for the purpose of identification, protection or directing persons to a use conducted therein must be deemed to be an integral but accessory and subordinate part of the principal use of land or building. Therefore, the intent of this Section is to establish limitations on signs in order to ensure they are appropriate to the building, use, or status of the land to which they are appurtenant and are adequate for their intended purpose while balancing individual and community interests. 
D.  These regulations are intended to promote signs that are compatible with the use of the property to which they are appurtenant, landscape and architecture of surrounding buildings, are legible and appropriate to the activity to which they pertain, are not distracting to motorists, and are constructed and maintained in a structurally sound and attractive condition. 
E.  These regulations do not regulate every form and instance of visual communication that may be displayed anywhere within the jurisdictional limits of the City of Peoria. Rather, they are intended to regulate those forms and instances that are most likely to meaningfully affect one or more of the purposes set forth above. 
F.  These regulations do not entirely eliminate all of the harms that may be created by the installation and display of signs. Rather, they strike an appropriate balance that preserves ample channels of communication by means of visual display while still reducing and mitigating the extent of the harms caused by signs. 
G.  These regulations are not intended to and do not apply to signs erected, maintained or otherwise posted, owned or leased by the government of the United States, the State of Arizona, or the City of Peoria. The inclusion of "government" in describing some signs does not intend to subject the government to regulation, but instead helps illuminate the type of sign that falls within the immunities of the government from regulation. 
H.  Graphical representations are often used throughout this Section to further clarify the intent of the text and serve as examples. However, whenever there is a conflict between the text and the illustration, the language of the text shall prevail. 
(Ord. No. 2018-08 , § 2(Exh. A), 3-6-18) 
Sec. 21-829. - Severability. 
A.  If there is a conflict between provisions of this Section and other provisions of the Zoning Ordinance or other regulations/ordinances of the City of Peoria, the more restrictive provisions shall apply. 
B.  The provisions of this Section shall apply to the erection, design, construction, alteration, use, location and maintenance of all signs within the City of Peoria, except as specified in this Section. 
(Ord. No. 2018-08 , § 2(Exh. A), 3-6-18) 
Sec. 21-830. - Nonconformity and Modification. 
    A sign lawfully in existence on the date of adoption of this Section, and which does not conform to the provisions of this Sign Code, but which was in compliance with applicable regulations at the time it was constructed, erected, affixed or maintained shall be regarded as a legal nonconforming sign. 
A.  Reasonable repairs may be made to legal nonconforming signs. However, to the extent any legal nonconforming sign is: 1) damaged in any manner and that damage exceeds fifty (50) percent of the reproduction cost according to an appraisal by licensed appraisers or fair market cost, 2) is destroyed, or 3) is removed by any means whatsoever, including acts of God or other calamities, then such sign may be restored, reconstructed, or altered only in conformance with the provisions of this Sign Code. 
B.  Any sign which does not fall within the provisions of Section 21-830 shall be brought immediately into compliance with all provisions of this Sign Code. 
(Ord. No. 2018-08 , § 2(Exh. A), 3-6-18) 
Sec. 21-831. - Definitions. 
    Words and terms used in this Sign Code shall have the meanings given here, or in Section 21-202, Definitions if not defined herein. Unless expressly stated otherwise, any pertinent word or term not part of this listing or Section 21-202, but vital to the interpretation of this Section, shall be construed to have its legal definition, or in absence of a legal definition, their commonly accepted meaning, unless its context makes clear otherwise.

B.  Sign Area Calculations. 
1.  Building Wall Signage. A building owner may choose to have the entirety of a building used for computing sign area, even if it is divided into multiple suites occupied by separate tenants. In this case, it is the responsibility of the building owner to determine the percentage of total allowable signage that shall be allocated to every business/tenant. Signage for individual businesses/tenants in buildings where signage is approved on a whole-building basis may be placed on any facade otherwise meeting the regulations of this Sign Code, regardless of the location of the tenant's main entrance. Whole building calculations shall afford a minimum of 20 SF of signage to each business/tenant. 
2.  Multiple Sign Faces. Calculating the sign area shall be based on the number of sign faces as described below. Architectural embellishments are not considered as sign area, so long as they do not constitute an area that is more than twenty (20) percent of the total sign area. 
a.  One (1) face - Area of the single face only. 
b.  Two (2) faces - If the interior angle between the two (2) faces is 45 degrees or less, the area will be the area of one (1) face only; if the interior angle between the two (2) sign faces is greater than 45 degrees, the sign area will be the sum of the areas of the two (2) faces. 

c.  Three (3) or more faces - The sign area will be the sum of the areas of each of the faces. 

d.  Spherical, free-form, sculptural, other non-planar signs - Sign area will be the sum of the area using only the four (4) vertical sides of the smallest cube that will encompass the sign. 

C.  Sign Height Calculations, Freestanding Signs. 
1.  The height of freestanding signs shall be measured from the existing grade within two (2) feet of the proposed sign location to the top of the sign structure. 
2.  In instances where the existing grade of the proposed sign location is lower than the adjacent roadway, the sign height shall be measured from the top of curb, or crown of roadway where no curb exists, to the top of the sign structure. 
D.  Street Designations. When the sign standards refer to a specific street, or the functional classification of street (e.g. Parkway), this shall mean the corresponding street alignment or street classification as designated on the City's Street Classification Map. 
E.  Signage Placement, Multi-Story Buildings. The building owner(s) shall be responsible for designating the allowable areas where signs may be placed on the building façade. For multi-story buildings, the allowable areas may be located anywhere on the building façade, so long as the signage does not project above the roof of the building. 
F.  Signage Projection. Building Wall Signage may be extend up to fourteen (14) inches away from the building. For buildings constructed on or near a property line that abuts a public right-of-way or public access easement (e.g where no building setback exists), the projection may encroach into the public right-of-way or public access easement provided such signs are located higher than eight (8) feet above ground level.

D.  Design and Integration. All permanent signs shall be fully integrated with the design of the building and the site development, reflecting the architecture, building materials and landscape elements of the project. 
1.  The means of integrating freestanding monument signs within the architecture of the building shall be achieved through replication of architectural embellishments, colors, building materials, texture and other elements exhibited in the building design. 
2.  In no case shall any sign be secured with wires such as guy wires or strips of wood which are visible and not an integral part of the sign. 
3.  Signs shall be designed in coordination with landscape plans, planting materials, storm water retention requirements, and utility pedestals, so as not to create problems with sign visibility or prompt the removal of required landscape materials.

(f)  The connection charge will be paid to the City, and the City agrees to repay such amounts to the property owner. Repayments shall be made by the City within sixty (60) days of receipt. The total of such repayments shall not exceed that portion of the agreed construction costs of the approach main allotted to frontage outside the service area of the property owner.

Sec. 25-34. - Water; repayments; water mains. 
(a)  This Chapter shall apply where a water main is extended by one property owner and connected to at a later date by one or more additional property owners. A property owner who extends a water main which is sixteen (16) inches in diameter or less and which provides a means of service to property owned by others may enter into an agreement with the City providing for repayment of a portion of the costs when the property abutting the main extensions develops. The project shall be bid in accordance with the provisions pertaining to public works projects contained in A.R.S. Title 34. The bids shall be opened at a location designated by the City on a pre-determined date agreeable to the property owner and the City. The City and the property owner reserve the right to reject any or all bids. The construction costs shall be determined prior to the commencement of construction and shall be approved by the City. In the event that the agreed upon construction costs increase, the repayment agreement may be amended upon approval of the additional construction costs by the City. 
(b)  The City reserves the right to increase the diameter of the approach main above the standards in this Chapter if it deems advisable, but under the condition, that the City will assume the additional cost to increase the diameter of the water main above that which the property owner would incur for the approach main under the standards required by this code. 
(c)  The final detailed plans and specifications for the water main extension must be approved by the City prior to construction. The engineering costs for the preparation of plans, specifications and staking of the approach main incurred by the property owner may be included in the agreed construction costs as provided for in this section. The costs of distribution mains within the boundary of the project shall not be eligible for repayment. 
(d)  Agreements must be executed prior to construction of the water main and shall run for a period not to exceed ten (10) years from the date of execution by the City Engineer, who is authorized to execute the agreements in accordance with the provisions of this code. The agreements shall automatically terminate at the end of a ten (10) year period or upon repayment of the total amount possible being repaid, whichever is earlier. The City will not approve and/or execute an agreement after construction or acceptance by the City of the water main. There will be no repayments for buy-in assessments collected prior to receipt of the developer's request to enter into an agreement. 
(e)  Repayment will assist in establishing a reasonable charge to permit a connection. The connection charge will be made on a cost per frontage foot, using the agreed water main construction costs (and the extent to which new development is adjacent to the water main), less the repayment transaction fee established by City Council to cover administrative costs associated with the repayment agreement. 
(f)  The City Engineer will determine the amount of footage to be reimbursed, and such determination will be made a part of the agreement. Such agreements must be recorded in the office of the Maricopa County Recorder. 
(g)  The City will make repayments within sixty (60) days of receipt of payment from adjacent property owners. The developer to whom the reimbursement is to be made must be stated on the agreement at the time of execution and it will be the duty of the developer (the individual to whom reimbursement is to be made) to keep the City Engineer advised as to the correct mailing address, etc. for reimbursement. Repayment agreements under this Chapter may be assigned to subsequent property owners of property who purchase or acquire the entire interest of the original property owner who entered into the repayment agreement and in accordance with the specific terms of the repayment agreement. 
(h)  The City retains and reserves the right (and ability) to enter into separate special agreements to cover unique situations where a standard repayment agreement is not applicable. 
(i)  Existing water lines, which are greater than sixteen (16) inches in diameter are considered part of the water transmission system and are not part of the water distribution grid. Property owners may be required to construct distribution mains of the required size parallel with such existing transmission system mains. Where existing distribution system mains within a development or along streets bounding the development, are smaller in size than that required by this code, or are otherwise inadequate, the property owner may be required to replace or parallel such mains with those of the required size.

Sec. 25-67. - Water; Reclaimed Water Use; customers, service agreements. 
(a)  Reclaimed water service shall only be provided to customers through reclaimed water use service agreements or annual orders for delivery as provided by the Public Works-Utilities Director. The Public Works-Utilities Director is authorized to execute such agreements on behalf of the City under the supervision of the City Attorney and approved as to form as required by the City Charter. 
Since contractual rights for/to the use of reclaimed water may result in added value to a customer's property, agreements/contracts shall recognize that possibility and require a waiver by the customer of any such added value in the event of purchase or condemnation of the property by the City through negotiation. This requirement shall be an implied term of all reclaimed water use service agreements or similar agreements between the City and a customer. 
(b)  Reclaimed water use shall be controlled as follows: 
(1)  The use of all reclaimed water derived from water developed by the City, including but not limited to the City's allocation of groundwater, Salt River Project and Central Arizona Project water, shall be directly controlled by the City. 
(2)  The use of all reclaimed water derived from water developed by entities other than the City, but served to customers within the corporate boundaries of the City, shall be directly controlled by the City. 
(c)  It shall be unlawful to receive or use reclaimed water in any area within the City limits other than by a Reclaimed Water Use Service Agreement or annual delivery agreement with the City. 
(d)  When private development requires reclaimed water service in advance of the City's construction schedule, such customers/developers shall work with the Public Works-Utilities Department to formulate a plan of service to be implemented at the sole expense of the customer/developer with facilities to be dedicated to City upon completion. Nothing herein will be construed to require the City to enter into such an agreement. 
(e)  The Reclaimed Water Use Service Agreement shall be in accordance with the Water Reuse System Master Plan, the Water Resources Master Plan and the City's water policy. Additionally, the Reclaimed Water Use Service Agreement recognizes that the use of reclaimed water may reduce the amount of groundwater or surface water that the City would have otherwise provided. 
(f)  Capital costs are those costs associated with providing distribution mains from the wastewater treatment facility to the point of delivery, up to, but not including, the connection. The Public Works-Utilities Director may designate areas as not being appropriate for capital cost recovery taking into account the benefit of promoting reclaimed water use and the benefit to the City from not receiving full capital cost recovery. 
(g)  No customer will be allowed to connect property to the reclaimed water system unless such customer has made payment in full for the share of the capital costs. Alternatively, the customer may enter into an assessment agreement and provide for a lien to be secured against and recorded upon such property. Additionally, the customer may provide such other financial security to cover such capital costs acceptable to the Chief Financial Officer and City Attorney. 
(h)  The City Council's adopted rate schedule for Reclaimed Water shall dictate the cost of reclaimed water. Such schedule may be amended from time to time, as needed. 
(i)  To the extent funding is available in the City's adopted Capital Improvement Program, the City may elect to finance or participate in the construction of reclaimed water pipelines in the City's water service area to serve customers whose estimated reclaimed water usage is sufficient to justify pipeline construction on the basis of economic feasibility and such participation is consistent with the City's adopted Water Reuse Master Plan.

Tampering or performing work shall include, but is not limited to, opening or closing of valves, turning on hydrants, or the causing of any water to flow from the system. It is also unlawful for any individual or customer, unless authorized by the Public Works-Utilities Director to: 
(1)  Cut into or make any improper connection to the City non-potable water distribution system. 
(2)  Use any unapproved connector. 
(3)  Cause or allow their non-potable water system to have any cross connections (between two or more water supplies), any illegal connections or tie-ins, or any discharge of non-potable water into the public sewer system. 
(4)  Let, rent, or resale to any other party or property any part of the non-potable water system or use of the non-potable water in any manner or for any purpose other than described in the ordinance and documents governing the non-potable water system and usage executed by the customer of the non-potable water service and the City. Any violations of the aforementioned nature may result in discontinuance or termination of non-potable water service as provided in this Chapter. The offending individual or customer shall be liable for the cost of all charges attributable to the correction of such tampering, including, but not limited to legal expenses. Payment for or correcting of such damage shall not relieve the offending individual or customer from criminal or Civil Sanctions the City or a court of law may impose for a violation of a City ordinance. 
(b)  It is unlawful for the customer to permit the non-potable water to be used for human or animal consumption, inter-connecting with another water source, sprinkling of edible crops (gardens), body contact, recreation, use through hose bibs, faucets, quick couplers, etc., filling of swimming pools, sharing a common non-potable water service or connection between properties, supplying air cooling systems (a/c units), or washing of equipment such as cars, boats, driveways, roofs, structures, etc.

Sec. 25-73. - Water; Non-potable Water Use; customers, service agreements. 
(a)  Non-potable water service shall only be provided to customers through non-potable water use service agreements or annual orders for delivery as provided by the Public Works-Utilities Director. The Public Works-Utilities Director is authorized to execute such agreements on behalf of the City under the supervision of the City Attorney and approved as to form as required by the City Charter. 
Since contractual rights for/to the use of non-potable water may result in added value to a customer's property, agreements/contracts shall recognize that possibility and require a waiver by the customer of any such added value in the event of purchase or condemnation of the property by the City through negotiation. This requirement shall be an implied term of all non-potable water use service agreements or similar agreements between the City and a customer. 
(b)  Non-potable water use shall be controlled as follows: 
(1)  The use of all non-potable water derived from water developed by the City, including but not limited to the City's allocation of groundwater, Salt River Project and Central Arizona Project water, shall be directly controlled by the City. 
(2)  To be eligible to use non-potable water, a customer shall be in compliance with Section 25-69 of this Code. 
(3)  The use of all non-potable water derived from water developed by entities other than the City, but served to customers within the corporate boundaries of the City, shall be directly controlled by the City. 
(c)  It shall be unlawful to receive or use non-potable water in any area within the City limits other than by a Non-Potable Water Use Service Agreement or annual delivery agreement with the City. 
(d)  When private development requires non-potable water service in advance of the City's construction schedule, such customers/developers shall work with the Public Works-Utilities Department to formulate a plan of service to be implemented at the sole expense of the customer/developer with facilities to be dedicated to City upon completion. Nothing herein will be construed to require the City to enter into such an agreement. 
(e)  The Non-Potable Water Use Service Agreement shall be in accordance with applicable City master plans and the City's water policy. Additionally, the Non-Potable Water Use Service Agreement recognizes that the use of non-potable water may reduce the amount of potable water or surface water that the City would have otherwise provided. 
(f)  Capital costs are those costs associated with providing distribution mains from a non-potable well to the point of delivery, up to, but not including, the connection. The Public Works-Utilities Director may designate areas as not being appropriate for capital cost recovery taking into account the benefit of promoting non-potable water use and the benefit to the City from not receiving full capital cost recovery. 
(g)  No customer will be allowed to connect property to the non-potable water system unless such customer has made payment in full for the share of the capital costs. Alternatively, the customer may enter into an assessment agreement and provide for a lien to be secured against and recorded upon such property. Additionally, the customer may provide such other financial security to cover such capital costs acceptable to the Chief Financial Officer and City Attorney. 
(h)  The City Council's adopted rate schedule for non-potable water shall dictate the cost of non-potable water. Such schedule may be amended from time to time, as needed.

(a)  Sewer main extensions shall be those mains subject to repayment and defined as any one or more of the following: 
(1)  Mains extended beyond the limits of the project, constructed through the project, or constructed along the frontage or boundary of the development; 
(2)  Mains which serve other property owners other than the owner who is developing the property; or 
(3)  Mains which are constructed to contain additional capacity to provide adequate flow above and beyond that required by the development based on the volume of flow and type of waste generated by the development. 
(b)  This Section shall apply where a wastewater line is extended by one property owner and connected to at a later date by one or more additional property owners. A property owner who extends a sewer line which provides a means of service to property owned by others may enter into an agreement with the City providing for repayment of a portion of the costs when the property abutting the sewer line extensions develops. The project shall be bid in accordance with the provisions pertaining to public works projects contained in A.R.S. Title 34. The bids shall be opened at a location designated by the City on a pre-determined date agreeable to the property owner and the City. The City and the property owner reserve the right to reject any or all bids. The construction costs shall be determined prior to the commencement of construction and shall be approved by the City. In the event that the agreed upon construction costs increase, the repayment agreement may be amended upon approval of the additional construction costs by the City. 
(c)  The City reserves the right to increase the diameter of the approach sewer mains above that needed to serve the individual property/development if it deems advisable, but under the condition that the City will assume the additional cost to increase the diameter of the sewer line above that which the property owner would incur for the approach sewer line required to serve the development. 
(d)  The final detailed plans and specifications for the sewer line extension must be approved by the City Engineer prior to construction. The engineering costs for the preparation of plans, specifications, and staking of the approach sewer line incurred by the property owner may be included in the agreed construction costs as provided for in this Section. The costs of distribution mains within the boundary of the project shall not be eligible for repayment. 
(e)  Agreements must be executed prior to construction of the wastewater main and shall run for a period not to exceed ten years from the date of execution by the City Engineer, who is authorized to execute the agreements in accordance with the provisions of this Code. The agreements shall automatically terminate at the end of a ten-year period or upon repayment of the total amount possible being repaid, whichever is earlier. The City will not approve and/or execute an agreement after construction or acceptance by the City of the wastewater main. There will be no repayments for buy-in assessments collected prior to receipt of the developer's request to enter into an agreement. 
(f)  Repayment will assist in establishing a reasonable charge to permit a connection. The connection charge will be made on a cost per frontage foot, using the agreed wastewater main construction costs (and the extent to which new development is adjacent to the wastewater main), less the repayment transaction fee established by the City Council to cover administrative costs associated with the repayment agreement. 
(g)  The City Engineer will determine the amount of footage to be reimbursed, and such determination will be made a part of the agreement. Such agreements must be recorded in the office of the Maricopa County Recorder. 
(h)  The City will make repayments within 60 days of receipt of payment from adjacent property owners.

Sec. 25-120. - Determination of wastewater quantity and billings. 
(a)  For users with installed water meters that are to be billed on basis of water consumption, sewer charges herein shall become effective after each user's first regular meter reading. For uses to be billed on a flat rate the charges shall be effective on the first month after the rates established herein become effective. 
(b)  Any affected user who fails or refuses to install a water meter to any source of water supply used, within thirty (30) days after written notice by the Director of Finance, or their designee, to do so, shall be charged on water usage estimated by the director of finance. 
(c)  If a user discharges sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the city sewer system, either directly or indirectly, and it can be shown by such party, to the satisfaction of the Director of Finance that a portion of the water as measured by the water meter does not and cannot enter the sewer system, then the Director of Finance may determine in such manner and by such method as he may find practicable the percentage of metered water entering the sewer system. The quantity of water used to determine the sewer charge shall be that percentage, determined by the Director of Finance, entering the sewer system. In the absence of suitable data to make such a determination the sewer user charge will be based on the amount of water supplied to the premises. The Director of Finance may require or permit the installation of acceptable additional water or sewer meters at such party's expense and in such a manner as to determine the quantity of water actually entering the sewer system, in which case, the quantity of water used to determine the sewer charge shall be the quantity of water actually entering the sewer system as so determined. 
(d)  After installation of approved measuring equipment, it shall be the obligation of each user to conduct a test on such measuring equipment at least once every twelve (12) months to determine its accuracy and the results thereof shall be furnished in writing to the director. Those users seeking renewal of an industrial wastewater discharge permit or an interim industrial wastewater discharge permit shall file the results as part of the report required in this chapter. It shall also be the user's responsibility to notify the city within a reasonable time in advance so that the department may, if it chooses, have a witness present during the test. If upon test the percentage of accuracy is found to be within the accuracy tolerance as established by the manufacturer's specifications, the measuring equipment shall be determined to have correctly measured the quantity delivered to the sewer system. If, however, upon test the percentage of accuracy is found to be in excess of the accuracy tolerance specified by the manufacturers, then the measuring equipment shall be immediately adjusted to register correctly the quantity delivered to the sewer system. The billings to such user shall be adjusted for a period extending back to the time when the inaccuracy began, if such time is ascertainable, or for a period extending back one-half of the time elapsed since the date of the last test or the date of the last adjustment, if the time is not ascertainable. 
(e)  All users for which the water supply is from other suppliers of water shall furnish to the city either a certified meter reading of water delivered to its plant or company, or a copy of the billing from the water supplier. In this event, the user's charges will be calculated and the same conditions will apply as if the city were the supplier of water to the user.

(a)  All sewer charges are to be added to, and collected with, the bills rendered for water service by the city. Where the user does not use city water the bill shall be due for sewer service rendered. All rules and regulations promulgated by the city shall apply to, and be effective in, the collection of sewer service charges. 
(b)  All sewer user accounts shall be carried on the books of the Finance Department by the house and street number. All notices sent out by the city regarding sewer user accounts, and all notices regarding any other matter pertaining to the use of the city sewer system shall be sent to the house and street number of such property.

Sec. 25-139. - Wastewater Pretreatment; Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards; State Pretreatment Standards; Local Limits. 
(a)  Upon the promulgation of any Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standard, the Federal Standard if more stringent than limitations imposed under this Code for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this Code. The Director shall notify all affected Users of the applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR, Section 403.12. To ensure applicability of current Federal standards to local Industrial Users, the City shall update its Code as necessary to remain current with applicable Federal and State regulations. The national Categorical Pretreatment standards found in 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 are incorporated by reference into this Chapter and made a part hereto. 
(b)  Where a Categorical Pretreatment Standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the Director may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR § 403.6(c). 
(c)  When the limits in a Categorical Pretreatment Standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the Director may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual Industrial Users in accordance with 40 CFR § 403.6(c)(2). 
(d)  When wastewater subject to a Categorical Pretreatment Standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the Director shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR § 403.6(e). 
(e)  A User may obtain a variance from a Categorical Pretreatment Standard if the User can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR § 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the Categorical Pretreatment Standard. 
(f)  An Industrial User may obtain a net gross adjustment to a Categorical Pretreatment Standard in accordance with the following Subsections of this Section and 40 CFR § 403.15: 
(1)  Categorical Pretreatment Standards may be adjusted to reflect the presence of pollutants in the Industrial User's intake water in accordance with this Section. Any Industrial User wishing to obtain credit for intake pollutants must make application to the City. Upon request of the Industrial User, the applicable Standard will be calculated on a "net" basis (i.e., adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water) if the requirements of paragraph (2) of this Section are met. 
(2)  Criteria. 
(i)  Either; 
a.  The applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standards contained in 40 CFR subchapter N specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net basis; or 
b.  The Industrial User demonstrates that the control system it proposes or uses to meet applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standards would, if properly installed and operated, meet the Standards in the absence of pollutants in the intake waters. 
(ii)  Credit for generic pollutants such as Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), and Oil and Grease shall not be granted unless the Industrial User demonstrates that the constituents of the generic measure in the User's effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere. 
(iii)  Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standard(s), up to a maximum value equal to the influent value. Additional monitoring may be necessary to determine eligibility for credits and compliance with standard(s) adjusted under this Section. 
(iv)  Credit shall be granted only if the User demonstrates that the intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the POTW discharges. The City may waive this requirement if it finds that no environmental degradation will result. 
(g)  When a Categorical Pretreatment Standard is expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations, an Industrial User may request that the City convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the Director. The City may establish equivalent mass limits only if the Industrial User meets all of the following conditions: 
(1)  To be eligible for equivalent mass limits the Industrial user must meet all of the following criteria: 
(i)  Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of its' individual wastewater discharge permit; 
(ii)  Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standard, and not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment; 
(iii)  Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-term average production rate must be representative of current operating conditions; 
(iv)  Not all daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not appropriate to control the Discharge; and 
(v)  Have consistently complied with all applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standards during the period prior to the Industrial User's request for equivalent mass limits. 
(2)  An Industrial User subject to equivalent mass limits must meet all of the following criteria: 
(i)  Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits; 
(ii)  Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of a continuous effluent flow monitoring device; 
(iii)  Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify the Director whenever production rates are expected to vary more than twenty (20) percent from its' baseline production rates determined in Subsection (1)(iii) of this Section. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the Director will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
(iv)  Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to Subsection (1)(i) of this Section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit. 
(3)  When developing equivalent mass limits, the Director: 
(i)  Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the Industrial User by the concentration-based Daily Maximum and Monthly Average standard for the applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standard and the appropriate unit conversion factor; 
(ii)  Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and 
(iii)  May retain the same equivalent mass limit in the subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the Industrial User's actual average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow rate used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not based on the use of dilution as a substitute for pretreatment pursuant to Section 25-141. The Industrial User must also be in compliance with Section 25-186 regarding the prohibition of bypass. 
(h)  The Director may convert mass limits of the Categorical Pretreatment Standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 to concentration limits for the purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual Industrial Users. The conversion is at the discretion of the Director. 
(i)  Once included in its permit, the Industrial User must comply with the equivalent limitations developed in this Section in lieu of the promulgated Categorical Standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived in accordance with 40 CFR § 403.6(c)(7). 
(j)  Many Categorical Pretreatment Standards specify one limit for calculating maximum monthly average or 4-day average limitations. Where such standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation in accordance with 40 CFR § 403.6(c)(8). 
(k)  Any Industrial User operating under a permit incorporating mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based Standard shall notify the Director within (2) business days after the User has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the next calendar month. Any User not notifying the Director of such anticipated change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its' permit that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production rate in accordance with 40 CFR § 403.6(c)(9). 
(l)  State Pretreatment Standards.

(i)  The User shall notify the Director orally within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the discharge and notify the Director, the EPA Regional Wastewater Management Division Director, and State Hazardous Waste authorities in writing within ten business days of any discharge into the POTW of a substance, which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA Hazardous Waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the Industrial User discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waster per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the Industrial User: An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharge during the following twelve months. All written notifications must take place no later than ten business days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under 40 CFR 403.12(j). The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by Users subject to Categorical Pretreatment Standards under the self-monitoring requirements of 40 CFR 403.12(b), (d), and (e). 
(ii)  Discharges are exempt from the requirements of subpart (i) of this paragraph during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Discharge of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the Industrial User discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(iii)  In the case of new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the Industrial User must notify the Director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(iv)  In the case of any notification made under this paragraph, the Industrial User shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practicable. 
(2)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by the pretreatment provisions of this Chapter, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable Federal or State law.

Sec. 25-148. - Wastewater Pretreatment; Compliance Date Report. 
    Within Ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standards or, in the case of a New Source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to Pretreatment Standards and Requirements shall submit to the Director a report containing the information described in Section 25-145(f). For Users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR § 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the User's long-term production rate. For all other Users subject to Categorical Pretreatment Standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the User's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. The reports shall state whether the applicable Pretreatment Standards and requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional operation and maintenance and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the User into compliance with the applicable Pretreatment Standards or Requirements. This report shall include the certification statement and be signed as described in Section 25-143. The compliance report shall be reviewed by an authorized representative of the Industrial User and shall be certified by a qualified professional. The qualified professional shall certify the Industrial User's compliance with applicable categorical standards and whether any pretreatment or operation and maintenance is required to attain compliance. This report shall be due ninety (90) days from final date for compliance in accordance with 40 CFR 403.12(d). All sampling will be done in accordance with Section 25-151. 
(Code 1977, §§ 12-2-4.8, 12-7-4; Ord. No. 90-11, 4/10/90; Ord. No. 91-41, 11/12/91; Ord. No. 09-39, 10/20/09, Amended (SUPP 2009-4)) 
Sec. 25-149. - Wastewater Pretreatment; Periodic Compliance Reports. 
(a)  Any Industrial User, whether or not subject to a Categorical Pretreatment Standard, except as specified in Section 25-151, after the compliance date if such Pretreatment Standard, or, in the case of a New Source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the Director, during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the Pretreatment Standard or by the Director, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such Categorical Pretreatment Standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period for the Discharge reported except that the Director may require more detailed reporting of flows. In cases where the Pretreatment Standard requires compliance with Best Management Practices (or pollution prevention alternative), the User shall submit documentation required by the Director or the Pretreatment Standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the User. At the discretion of the Director and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the Director may modify the months during which the above reports are to be submitted. 
(b)  The Director may reduce mass limitations on Users which are using dilution to meet applicable Pretreatment Standards or Requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases, the report required by Paragraph (1) of this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by Pretreatment Standards in the effluent of the User. These reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature, and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the Director, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable Pretreatment Standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be as prescribed in the applicable Pretreatment Standard. All analysis shall be performed in accordance with procedures established by the Administrator pursuant to Section 304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR Part 136, and amendments thereto, or with any other test procedures approved by the Administrator. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the Administrator. Where 40 CFR, Part 136, does not include a sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication, "Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants", April 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the Administrator. 
(c)  This Periodic Compliance Report shall include the certification statement and be signed described in Section 25-143. 
(d)  Compliance schedule for meeting Categorical Pretreatment Standards. The following conditions shall apply to the schedule required by 40 C.F.R. 403-12(c). 
(1)  The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the Industrial User to meet the applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standards (e.g., Hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contract for major components, commencing construction, completing construction, beginning and conducting routine operation, etc.) 
(2)  No increment referred to in paragraph (d)(1) of this subsection shall exceed nine (9) months. 
(3)  Not later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the Industrial User shall submit a progress report to the Director including, at a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason for delay, and the appropriate steps being taken by the Industrial User to return the construction to the schedule established. 
(4)  In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such progress reports to the Director. 
(e)  The City may authorize an Industrial User subject to a Categorical Pretreatment Standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a Categorical Pretreatment Standard if the Industrial User has demonstrated through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the Discharge, or is present only at background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of the Industrial User. [see 40 CFR § 403.12(e)(2)] This is authorization is subject to the following conditions: 
(1)  The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable Categorical Standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater. 
(2)  The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case longer than 5 years. The User must submit a new request for the waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater discharge permit. 
(3)  In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the Industrial User must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is representative of all wastewater from all processes. 
(4)  The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance with Section 25-76, and include the certification statement in Section 25-143. 
(5)  Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the analysis. 
(6)  Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Director must be included as a condition in the User's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the User in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the Director for 3 years after expiration of the waiver. 
(7)  Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the User's permit by the Director, the Industrial User must certify on each report with the statement in Section 25-143(c), that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream due to activities of the Industrial User. 
(8)  In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is expected to be present because of changes that occur in the User's operations, the User must immediately comply with the monitoring requirements of Section 25-149(a), or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the Director, and notify the Director. 
(9)  This provision does not supersede certification processes and requirements established in Categorical Pretreatment Standards, except as otherwise specified in the Categorical Pretreatment Standard. 
(f)  All wastewater samples must be representative of the User's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a User to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the User to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(g)  If a User subject to the reporting requirement in this Section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the Director, the results of this monitoring and a chain of custody for all samples analyzed shall be included in the report. 
(Code 1977, §§ 12-2-5, 12-2-6; Ord. No. 90-11, 4/10/90; Ord. No. 91-41, 11/12/91; Ord. No. 08-35, 12/02/08, Amended (SUPP 2008-4); Ord. No. 09-39, 10/20/09, Amended (SUPP 2009-4)) 
Sec. 25-150. - Monitoring Facility. 
(a)  The city shall require to be provided and operated at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurements of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. 
(b)  There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manholes or facilities to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. 
(c)  Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the City's requirements, and all applicable local construction standards and specification. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following written notification by the city. 
(Code 1977, §§ 12-2-6.2 through 12-2-6.6, 12-2-6.14; Ord. No. 90-11, 4/10/90; Ord. No. 91-41, 11/12/91) 
Sec. 25-151. - Wastewater Pretreatment; Inspection; Sampling and Analytical Procedures. 
(a)  All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the Director or other parties approved by the EPA. 
(b)  Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of the conditions occurring during the reporting period. 
(1)  Except as indicated in Subsections (2) and (3), the User must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the Director. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the City, the samples must be representative of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols; and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the City, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with Instantaneous Limits. 
(2)  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
(3)  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports required in Sections 25-148 and 25-149, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the Director may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by paragraphs Sections 25-149, the Industrial User is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable Pretreatment Standards and requirements. Chain of Custodies for all sampled parameters shall accompany the compliance reports. 
(c)  Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
(d)  The Director shall have the right to enter the premises of any User to determine whether the User is complying with all requirements of this ordinance and any individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the Director ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
(1)  Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the City to have ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purpose of inspection, sampling, records examination or in the performance of any of their duties. 
(2)  The City shall have the right to set upon on the User's property or require installation of such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering of the User's operations. 
(3)  Where a User has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the User shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the City will be permitted without delay for the purpose of performing their specific responsibilities. 
(4)  Any User subject to the reporting regulations established in this Chapter, shall make such records available upon request for the purposes of inspection and copying by the Director. 
(5)  The Director may require the User to install monitoring equipment as necessary, as further described in the City's Engineering Development Guidelines for Wastewater, currently found in Chapter 6-3.B. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the User at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated monthly to ensure their accuracy. 
(6)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the User at the written or verbal request of the Director and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the User. 
(7)  Unreasonable delays in allowing the Director access to the User's premises shall be a violation of the pretreatment provisions of this Chapter. 
(8)  If the Director has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of the wastewater pretreatment provisions of this Chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the City designed to verify compliance with the wastewater pretreatment provisions of this Chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the Director may seek issuance of a search warrant from the Peoria Municipal Court or other appropriate court. 
(9)  The Director retains the right to carry out all inspection, surveillance, and monitoring procedures necessary to determine, independent of information supplied by Industrial User, compliance or noncompliance with applicable Pretreatment Standards and Requirements by Industrial Users. Representatives of the POTW shall be authorized to enter any premises of any Industrial User in which a Discharge source or treatment system is located or in which records are required to be kept under 40 CFR § 403.12(0) to assure compliance with Pretreatment Standards.

Sec. 25-152. - Wastewater Pretreatment; pretreatment required. 
(a)  All Users are required to properly operate and maintain all pretreatment equipment and processes in a manner that will provide for the effective pretreatment of wastes. All Users have a duty to halt and/or reduce, to the extent possible, any discharge that has the potential to cause either Pass-Through or Interference with the operation of the POTW. Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this Code, and shall achieve compliance with all Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards, Local Limits, and all other applicable Federal, State, and local requirements within the time limitations as specified by the EPA, ADEQ, or the Director, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities required to pre-treat wastewater to a level acceptable by the Director shall be provided, operated and maintained at the User's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the Director for review, and shall be acceptable to the Director before construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the User from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the City under the provisions of this Code. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facility or method of operation shall be reported to and be approved in writing by the Director prior to the initiation of the changes. 
(b)  The City shall annually publish in any newspaper of general circulation within the City a list of the Users found in noncompliance with any Pretreatment Requirements or Standards at least once during the twelve (12) previous months. The notification shall also summarize any enforcement action taken against the User(s) during the same twelve (12) months. 
(c)  Whenever deemed necessary, the Director may require Users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the User's compliance with the requirements of the pretreatment provisions of this Chapter. 
(d)  The Director may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. An individual wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization. 
(e)  Grease, oil, sand and lint interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the Director, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil, sand, lint or other objectionable material; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential Users. All interception units shall be of type and capacity approved by the Director and shall be located so as to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired regularly, as required by Sections 25-174, by the User at their expense. 
(f)  Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.

Sec. 25-153. - Confidentiality of Information. 
(a)  Information and data obtained from reports, questionnaires, individual waste discharge permits, monitoring programs and/or from the Director's inspections and sampling activities shall be available to the public or any governmental agency without restriction unless the User specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the User by law. To claim this trade secret protection, the User must specify at the time of submitting their report or information, that part the User desires to protect. 
(b)  When requested and demonstrated by the User furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but such portion of the submission shall be available immediately upon request for use by the State or any other governmental agency for uses related to the AZPDES program or pretreatment program and in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the information. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data as defined by 40 CFR § 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction.

Sec. 25-160. - Wastewater Pretreatment; Administrative hearing; Orders; Fines. 
(a)  Consent Orders. The Director may enter into Consent Orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any User responsible for noncompliance with the Pretreatment sections in this Code. Such documents shall include specific action to be taken by the User to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to this Section and shall be enforceable judicially. 
(b)  Show Cause Administrative Hearings. 
(1)  The Director may order any User who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this Code concerning Pretreatment, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement to appear and show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served upon the User in any manner calculated to provide reasonable notice specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the Director regarding the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the User show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Service may be made in any manner permitted under Rule 4, Arizona Rules of Civil Procedure, except publication. Such notice may be served on any Authorized Representative of the User. 
(2)  The Director shall conduct the show cause hearing and may: 
(i)  Hear and consider all relevant and probative evidence, regardless of whether such evidence is admissible under the Arizona Rules of Evidence. 
(ii)  Issue subpoenas, compel the testimony of witnesses and production of evidence in the manner provided by A.R.S. § 12-2212. Testimony shall be taken under oath and shall be recorded. 
(3)  Following the completion of a show cause hearing, the Director shall issue a written decision explaining the Director's conclusion as to whether the User committed the cited violation(s). If the Director concludes that a violation did occur, the Director may impose any of the penalties and remedies provided for Pretreatment violations. 
(4)  A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against a User who is in non-compliance. 
(c)  Compliance Orders. When the Director finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any Pretreatment provision of this Code, an individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the Director may issue an order to the User responsible for the discharge directing that the User come into compliance within a specified time. If the User does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the User of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User. 
(d)  Cease and Desist Orders. When the Director finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any Pretreatment provision of this Code, a individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, or that the User's past violations are likely to recur, the Director may issue an order to the User directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the User to: 
(1)  Immediately comply with all requirements; and 
(2)  Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User. 
(e)  Administrative Fines. 
(1)  When the Director finds that a User has violated, or continues to violate, any Pretreatment provision of this Code, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the Director may fine such User in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation. 
(2)  This administrative fine shall constitute a lien against the property upon which the violation is located in the same manner as other unpaid utility fees under this Chapter. 
(3)  Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, the Director taking any other action against the User. 
(4)  A User may seek judicial review of an administrative fine issued pursuant to this Subsection. 
(f)  Emergency Suspensions. The Director may suspend immediately a User's discharge, after informal notice to the User, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The Director may also suspend immediately a User's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment. 
(1)  Any User notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a User's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Director may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Director may allow the User to recommence its discharge when the User has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless termination proceedings are initiated against the User. 
(2)  A User that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Director prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing. 
(3)  Nothing in this Subsection shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension. 
(g)  Termination of Discharge. 
(1)  In addition to other enforcement options, any User who violates any one or more of the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
(i)  Violation of an individual wastewater discharge permit condition; 
(ii)  Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 
(iii)  Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge; 
(iv)  Refusal of reasonable access to the User's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 
(v)  Violation of the Pretreatment Standards in this Code. 
(2)  The Director will notify such User of the proposed termination of its discharge and offer an opportunity to show cause under this Section why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the Director shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the User.

Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b)  A User may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause Pretreatment Standards or Requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of Subsections (c) and (d) of this Section. 
(c)  Notice. 
(1)  If a User knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the Director, at least ten (10) business days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(2)  A User shall submit oral notice to the Director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable Pretreatment Standards within twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission also shall be provided within ten (10) business days of the time the User becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Director may waive the written report on a case by case basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours. 
(d)  Prohibition on Bypass. 
(1)  Bypass is prohibited, and the Director may take an enforcement action against a User for a bypass, unless all of the following criteria are met: 
(i)  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
(ii)  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
(iii)  The User submitted notices as required under Subsection (c) of this Section. 
(2)  The Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the Director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in Subsection (d)(1) of this Section.

ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY - ORDINANCE NO. 05-69 
AN ORDINANCE GRANTING ARIZONA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY, AN ARIZONA CORPORATION, ITS SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, THE RIGHT, PRIVILEGE AND FRANCHISE TO CONSTRUCT, MAINTAIN, AND OPERATE UPON, OVER, ALONG, ACROSS AND UNDER THE STREETS, AVENUES, ALLEYS, HIGHWAYS, BRIDGES AND OTHER PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY IN THE CITY OF PEORIA, ARIZONA, ITS ELECTRICAL TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, POWER LINES, AND NECESSARY APPURTENANCES FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUPPLYING ELECTRIC ENERGY TO THE CITY, ITS SUCCESSORS, THE INHABITANTS THEREOF, AND INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES WITHIN THE LIMITS THEREOF; PRESCRIBING CERTAIN RIGHTS, DUTIES, TERMS AND CONDITIONS; PROVIDING FOR THE SUBMISSION HEREOF TO THE ELECTORS FOR THEIR APPROVAL; AND DECLARING AN EMERGENCY. 

Section 1. - Grant of Franchise: 
    There is hereby granted to Arizona Public Service Company, a corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Arizona (herein called "Grantee"), its successors and assigns, the right and privilege to construct, maintain and operate its electrical system, as defined herein, upon, over, along, across and under the present and future public rights-of-way (herein called "Franchise"). These rights-of-way include but are not limited to streets, alleys and highways in the City of Peoria, Arizona (herein called "the City"). Grantee's system includes electric power lines, together with all necessary or desirable appurtenances, including, but not limited to, poles, towers, wires, cables, conduits, transmission lines, transformers, switches and communication lines for Grantee's own use. This Franchise is for Grantee's use of the City's public rights-of-way to supply and deliver electric energy to the City, its successors, the inhabitants thereof, and all individuals and entities either within or beyond the limits thereof, for all purposes. 
    This Franchise shall extend to and include all streets, avenues, alleys, highways, bridges, and other public rights-of-way within the limits of the City, and any part thereof, either as now located and as may be hereafter or extended within the present or any future limits of the City, provided, however, that the City shall not be liable to Grantee should Grantee construct facilities pursuant to this grant on an area which the City has erroneously exercised dominion and control. 
    This Franchise does not include cable communication services as defined by Chapter 5 of the Peoria City Code (1992) or telecommunication services as defined by Chapter 23 of the Peoria City Code (1992) regardless of whether such telecommunication services are interstate or intrastate. Grantee agrees that if Grantee uses its wires, cables or lines for telecommunication services, Grantee must apply for and obtain a telecommunications license from the City. 
Section 2. - Grantee's Compliance with the City's Practice; Plans Submitted for Approval; The City's Construction near Grantee's Facilities: 
    Grantee shall perform all construction under this Franchise in accordance with the City's established practices, duly adopted standards or as required by permits, which may incorporate special standards when required for the City's purposes, with respect to such public rights-of-way. Before Grantee makes any installations in the public rights-of-way, Grantee shall submit for approval a map showing the location of such proposed installations to the City Engineer/Engineering Director. Grantee will provide as available its plans for major construction projects and system improvements in the City planning area. Grantee shall cooperate with the City to furnish upon the City's request the plans and maps required by this section in an electronic format compatible with the City's current electronic format. If Grantee needs to change its electronic format to be compatible with the City's format, Grantee shall do so within a reasonable time. 
    Prior to the installation, construction, erection, enlargement, replacement, extension or relocation of any portion of the electric transmission and distribution system authorized herein, Grantee shall apply for and obtain from the City a permit pursuant to the City Street Code, Chapter 23 of the City Code, as amended. The City shall issue such permit to Grantee on such conditions as are reasonable and necessary to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of this Franchise. 
    If the City authorizes any construction project adjacent to or near Grantee's facilities operated pursuant to this Franchise, the City shall include in all such construction specifications, bids, and contracts, a requirement that the contractor or his designee must comply with the overhead power line safety laws (A.R.S. § 40-360.41 et. seq. as amended). 
Section 3. - Construction and Relocation of Grantee's Facilities; Payment: 
    All Grantee's facilities shall be installed, constructed, located or relocated pursuant to this Franchise so as to interfere as little as possible with traffic, or other authorized uses over, under or through the streets, avenues, highways, bridges, and other public rights-of-way. For the purpose of this Franchise, traffic use shall include the City's traffic signals, traffic control related equipment, as well as the City's signal interconnect fiber. Those phases of construction of Grantee's facilities relating to traffic control, backfilling, compaction and paving, as well as the location or relocation of lines and related facilities herein provided for shall be subject to regulation by the City. Grantee shall keep accurate records of the location of all facilities in the public rights-of-way and furnish them to the City. Upon completion of new or relocation construction of underground facilities in the public rights-of-way, Grantee shall provide the City Engineer/Engineering Director with corrected drawings showing the actual location of the underground facilities in those cases where the actual location differs significantly from the proposed location. All underground abandoned lines shall continue to remain the property of Grantee, unless Grantee specifically acknowledges otherwise to the City Engineer/Engineering Director and such is accepted by the City. 
    Grantee shall cooperate with the City to furnish upon the City's request the actual location of such new or relocated facilities in the public rights-of-way in an electronic format compatible with the City's current electronic format. If Grantee needs to change its electronic format to be compatible with the City's format, Grantee shall do so within a reasonable time. 
A.  If the City requires Grantee to relocate Grantee's facilities which are located in private easements obtained by Grantee prior to the City's acquisition of said property from which the facilities must be relocated, the entire cost of relocating Grantee's facilities (including the cost of purchasing a new private easement if necessary) shall be borne by the City. The City shall also bear the entire cost of all subsequent relocations of the relocated facilities required by the City, until such time as the City condemns or purchases Grantee's private easement. 
B.  Except as covered in Paragraph A above, Grantee shall bear the entire cost of relocating facilities located on public rights-of-way, the relocation of which is necessary for the City's carrying out a function in the interest of the public health, safety or welfare. Grantee's right to maintain its lines and facilities is subject to the paramount right of the City, to use its streets for all governmental purposes. Governmental purposes include, but are not limited to, the following functions of the City: 
(1)  Any and all improvements to the City streets, alleys, and avenues; 
(2)  Establishing and maintaining sanitary sewers, storm drains, and related facilities; 
(3)  Installation of pipe and other facilities to serve domestic and municipal water; 
(4)  Establishing and maintaining municipal parks, parking spaces (or parking lots), parkways, pedestrian malls or grass, shrubs, trees and other vegetation for purposes of landscaping any street or public property; 
(5)  Providing fire protection; 
(6)  The relocation of Grantee's facilities necessary to carry out the exercise of the City's police power for urban renewal; 
(7)  Collection and disposal of garbage and recyclable materials. 
C.  The City reserves its prior superior right to use the public rights-of-way, including the surface areas, for all public purposes, funded with public funds. When the City uses its prior superior right to the public rights-of-way for a governmental function, Grantee shall move its property that is located in the public rights-of-way at its own cost, to such location as the City directs (with the exception of relocations in private easements, addressed in subsection A above). The City will bear the entire cost of relocating any of Grantee's facilities, the relocation of which is necessitated by the construction of improvements by or on behalf of the City in furtherance of a proprietary function. All functions of the City that are not governmental are proprietary. 
If the City participates in the cost of relocating Grantee's facilities for any reason, the cost of relocation to the City shall not include any upgrade or improvement of Grantee's facilities as they existed prior to relocation. 
    While the City and Grantee acknowledge that the City has a right to require relocation of Grantee's facilities in public rights-of-way, the City will not exercise its right to require Grantee's facilities to be relocated in an unreasonable or arbitrary manner, or to avoid its obligation under the Franchise. In such instances where relocation of Grantee's facilities is required, the City will provide Grantee with sufficient time for such relocation. 
    The City agrees it will not require Grantee to relocate its facilities located within the public rights-of-way without providing Grantee adequate space within the rights-of-way to relocate the facilities that must be moved. 
    The City will exercise its best effort to not plant any tree that can normally grow to a height of more than 25 feet in the public rights-of-way under or adjacent to Grantee's overhead power lines. Grantee shall have the authority to trim, prune or remove any trees or shrubs located within or hanging over the limits of the public rights-of-way of the City that in the judgment of Grantee may interfere with the construction, or endanger the operation, of the lines and/or facilities of Grantee. All said vegetation management work is to be done at Grantee's expense. 
Section 4. - Indemnification: 
    The City shall in no way be liable to or responsible for any accident or damage that may occur in the construction, operation or maintenance by Grantee of its lines and appurtenances hereunder, and the acceptance of this grant shall be deemed an agreement on the part of Grantee to indemnify the City and hold it harmless from and against any and all liability, loss, costs, legal fees, damage or any other expense which may be imposed on the City by reason of the acts of this Grantee in the construction, operation and maintenance of its lines and appurtenances hereunder, including the maintenance of barricades and traffic control devices in construction and maintenance areas. The City shall indemnify and hold Grantee harmless from any and all claims, costs, damages, expenses and losses, including but not limited to attorney fees and court costs relating to, or arising out of, or alleged to have resulted from the City's use of Grantee's facilities pursuant to this Franchise, provided, however, that such claims are not the result of willful misconduct, negligent acts or omissions of Grantee. 
    Grantee shall have and maintain throughout the term of this Franchise liability insurance, a program of self-retention or general assets to adequately insure and/or protect the legal liability of Grantee with reference to the installation, operation and maintenance of its facilities authorized herein to occupy the public rights-of-way. 
Section 5. - Restoration of Rights-of-Way: 
    Whenever Grantee shall cause any opening or alteration to be made for any purpose in any public rights-of-way, the work shall be completed with due diligence pursuant to the City issued permit in accordance with Chapter 23 of the City Code (as amended) and Grantee shall, without expense to the City and upon completion of such work, restore the disturbed property in a manner consistent with the City's duly adopted standards, or as required by City permit. 
    Should such restoration, repair or replacement fail to be completed pursuant to the City issued permit or fail to meet the City's duly adopted standards, as may be amended from time to time, the City shall provide notice to Grantee of such failure and provide reasonable time for Grantee to perform restoration, repair or replacement. Except due to circumstances beyond Grantee's control, the City may then perform the necessary restoration, repair or replacement either through its own forces or through a hired contractor and Grantee agrees to reimburse the City for the reasonable expenses it incurred in performing the necessary restoration, repair or replacement, together with the pavement cut surcharges as provided in Chapter 23 of the Peoria City Code (1992) within thirty (30) days after receipt of an invoice from the City. 
Section 6. - Franchise Fee: 
    Grantee shall pay to the City in consideration of the grant of this Franchise a sum equal to two percent (2%) of all revenues of Grantee, including Regulatory Assessments but, excluding governmental impositions, from the retail sales and/or delivery by it of electric energy and other charges for services attendant to the retail sale and/or delivery of electric energy delivered through Grantee's electric distribution system within the present and any future corporate limits of the City, as shown by Grantee's billing records. Except as otherwise provided in this Franchise, said payments shall be in lieu of any and all fees, charges or exaction of any kind otherwise assessed by the City in any way associated with Grantee's use of the rights-of-way, including but not limited to, the construction of Grantee's facilities hereunder or for inspections thereof during the term of this Franchise.. Said payments are due and payable monthly on or before the thirtieth calendar day of the month next succeeding the end of the month in which the franchise fee accrued (the "Due Date"). Such payment shall be considered delinquent if not received by the last day of the month (the "Delinquent Date"). If the payment is later than the Delinquent Date, a 2% penalty will be added, and interest of 1.5% monthly shall occur on the entire amount due. The interest may be waived by the City if the failure to pay by the Delinquent Date was the result of an unforeseen event that renders Grantee unable to compute the liability from business records; provided, however, Grantee in such event must file an estimated payment by the Delinquent Date. Based on a history of prior on-time payments, the City may waive theinterest. 
    Grantee shall not, however, pay said franchise fee on revenues charged to Grantee's retail customers by third party electric service providers. 
    For the purpose of verifying amounts payable hereunder, the books and records of Grantee shall be subject to inspection by duly authorized officers or representatives of the City at reasonable times. 
    Grantee shall pay franchise fees pursuant to the terms of the previously executed franchise agreement through May 13, 2005. Beginning May 14, 2005, payment as described in the preceding paragraphs shall be payable in monthly amounts within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar month. 
    Notwithstanding the provisions of this Franchise, if during the term of this Franchise Grantee enters into any electricity franchise with any other municipality in Arizona during the term of this Franchise that provides for a higher percentage of Grantee's revenues than two percent (2%) or includes more categories of revenues than set forth in this Franchise, Grantee shall notify the City of such higher percentage or expanded revenue base. Grantee agrees to henceforth pay to the City a new franchise fee at the higher franchise percentage or include the additional revenue categories. 
Section 7. - Additional Fees and Taxes: 
    Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary, Grantee shall pay, in addition to the payment provided in Section 6, the following charges, taxes and fees as established in a code or ordinance properly adopted by the City: 
    General ad valorem property taxes; 
    Transaction privilege and use tax as authorized by law and collected by Grantee for its retail sales to its users and consumers of electricity within the present and any future corporate limits of the City; 
    Pavement cut surcharge fees, as described in City Code 23-54(b) as enacted in Ord. No. 97-38, 7/15/97, which is effective as of November 8, 2005; 
    Other charges, taxes or fees generally levied upon businesses by the City, provided that the annual amount of such fee does not exceed the amount of similar fees paid by any other businesses operated within the City. 
Section 8. - Term: 
    This Franchise shall continue and exist for a period of twenty-five (25) years from May 14, 2005; provided, however, that either party may terminate this Franchise on its tenth anniversary by giving written notice of its intention to do so not less than one (1) year before the date of termination. If such notice is given for the purpose of negotiating a new franchise and such negotiation is successful, the party giving the notice of termination shall be responsible for the costs of the resulting franchise election. 
Section 9. - Franchise; Non-Exclusive: 
    This Franchise is not exclusive, and nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent the City from granting other like or similar grants or privileges to any other person, firm or corporation. 
Section 10. - Conflicting Ordinances: 
    Grantee agrees, insofar as the applicable provisions of the City Charter and the City Code existing at the time that this Franchise becomes effective are legally enforceable and constitute valid requirements, to comply therewith in all respects. Provided however, not withstanding any other provisions hereof, all ordinances and parts of ordinances in conflict with the provisions hereof, to the extent applicable to a franchised electric public service corporation, are hereby superseded. 
Section 11. - Independent Provisions: 
    If any section, paragraph, clause, phrase or provision of this Franchise, other than Section 6, shall be adjudged invalid or unconstitutional, the same shall not affect the validity of this Franchise as a whole or any part of the provisions hereof other than the part so adjudged to be invalid or unconstitutional. If Section 6 shall be adjudged invalid or unconstitutional in whole or in part by a final judgment, this Franchise shall immediately terminate and shall be of no further force or effect. 
Section 12. - The City Use of Facilities: 
    In consideration of this Franchise and the rights granted hereby, the City shall, if the following six criteria are met, have the right to place, maintain, and operate on Grantee's poles located on public rights-of-way within the City's corporate limits, any and all wires and appurtenances (other than steps or climbing devices) the City may use for its municipal fire alarm, police telephone or other municipal communications services utilized for governmental functions: 
    The City must notify Grantee in writing of the City's intended use of Grantee's poles; 
    The City shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, defend, indemnify and hold Grantee harmless from any and all claims, costs, damages, expenses and losses, including but not limited to attorney fees and court costs relating to, arising out of, or alleged to have resulted from the City's use of Grantee's facilities pursuant to this Franchise; provided however, that such claims, expenses and losses are not the result of the willful misconduct or negligent acts or omissions of Grantee. 
    The City's facilities and the installation and maintenance thereof must comply with the applicable requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the National Electrical Safety Code, and all other applicable rules and regulations as amended. If the City does not comply with all applicable laws, ordinances and regulations, or if the City's facilities create an immediate safety hazard, Grantee retains the right to remove or correct the City's facilities at the City's expense; 
    The City's facilities and the installation and maintenance thereof must not cause Grantee's facilities and the installation and maintenance thereof to be out of compliance with all applicable requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the National Electrical Safety Code and all other applicable rules and regulations as amended. If the City does not comply with all applicable laws, ordinances and regulations, or if the City's facilities create an immediate safety hazard, Grantee retains the right to remove or correct the City's facilities at the City's expense; 
    The City's use of its facilities shall not interfere with Grantee's use of Grantee's facilities, and; 
    The City shall be responsible for any incremental costs incurred by Grantee as a result of the City's use of Grantee's facilities. 
Section 13. - The City Reserves Certain Powers: 
    As required by the Peoria City Charter, the City expressly reserves unto itself, subject to the limitations of the Constitution and laws of Arizona, certain powers which may be necessary or convenient for the conduct of its municipal affairs, and for the health, safety, and general welfare of its inhabitants, including, among other things, the right to pass and enforce ordinances to require proper and adequate extensions of the service of the grant hereby made, and to protect the public from danger or inconvenience in the operation of any work or business authorized by the grant of this Franchise, and the further right to make and enforce all such regulations as shall be reasonably necessary to secure adequate, sufficient and proper service, extensions and accommodations for the people and insure their comfort and convenience.

Grantee will notify the City if such transfer or assignment should occur.

SOUTHWEST GAS - ORDINANCE NO. 05-68 
AN ORDINANCE GRANTING SOUTHWEST GAS CORPORATION, A CALIFORNIA CORPORATION, ITS SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, THE RIGHT, PRIVILEGE AND FRANCHISE TO CONSTRUCT, MAINTAIN, AND OPERATE UPON, OVER, ALONG, ACROSS AND UNDER THE STREETS, AVENUES, ALLEYS, HIGHWAYS, BRIDGES AND OTHER PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY IN THE CITY OF PEORIA, ARIZONA, ITS GAS LINES, TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AND NECESSARY APPURTENANCES FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUPPLYING GAS, INCLUDING GAS MANUFACTURED BY ANY METHOD WHATSOEVER, AND/OR GAS CONTAINING A MIXTURE OF NATURAL GAS AND SUCH ARTIFICIAL GAS, AND/OR NATURAL GAS, TO THE CITY, ITS SUCCESSORS, THE INHABITANTS THEREOF, AND INDIVIDUALS AND ENTITIES WITHIN THE LIMITS THEREOF; PRESCRIBING CERTAIN RIGHTS, DUTIES, TERMS AND CONDITIONS; PROVIDING FOR THE SUBMISSION HEREOF TO THE ELECTORS FOR THEIR APPROVAL; AND DECLARING AN EMERGENCY. 
    WHEREAS, Southwest Gas Corporation, a California corporation, organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the State of California, has submitted a proposed Franchise to be granted to said Corporation, its successors and assigns, by the City of Peoria, Arizona, for the purpose of constructing, maintaining and operating its gas mains, pipelines and transmission and distribution system upon, over, along, across and under the present and future streets, alleys, highways, bridges, and other public rights-of-way in the City of Peoria, Arizona, together with all necessary appurtenances, for the purpose of supplying natural gas, to the City of Peoria, its successors, the inhabitants thereof, and all individuals and entities within the limits thereof; and the Constitution and laws of the State of Arizona and the Charter of the City of Peoria to provide for and require the submission of this proposed Franchise to the qualified electors of the City of Peoria for their approval or disapproval. 
    THEREFORE, be it ordained by the Mayor and Council of the City of Peoria, Arizona, as follows: 

Section 1. - Repealing and Replacing: 
    This ordinance repeals and replaces the previous Southwest Gas Corporation Franchise and amends Appendix A of the City of Peoria City Code (1992) to read as follows: 
Section 2. - Grant of Franchise: 
    There is hereby granted to Southwest Gas Corporation, a California corporation, organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the State of California (herein called "Grantee"), its successors and assigns, the right and privilege to construct, maintain and operate its gas facilities and distribution system, as defined herein, upon, over, along, across and under the present and future public rights-of-way (herein called "Franchise"). These rights-of-way include, but are not limited to, streets, alleys, highways and bridges in the City of Peoria, Arizona (herein called "the City"). Grantee's system includes a natural gas and/or artificial gas transmission and distribution system, together with all necessary appurtenances, including, but not limited to, conduits, supply lines, laterals, and transmission and distribution system, pipes, laterals, service lines, pumps, manholes, meters, gauges, valves, traps, vaults, regulators, regulator stations, appliances, attachments and related equipment, facilities and appurtenances for the purpose of supplying natural gas and/or artificial gas, including gas manufactured by any method whatsoever, and/or gas containing a mixture of natural gas and such artificial gas (herein called the "natural gas"). This Franchise is for Grantee's use of the City's public rights-of-way to supply and deliver natural gas to the City, its successors, the inhabitants thereof, and all individuals and entities either within or beyond the limits thereof, for all purposes. 
    This Franchise shall extend to and include all streets, avenues, alleys, highways, bridges, and other public rights-of-way within the limits of the City, and any part thereof, either as now located and as may be hereafter or extended within the present or any future limits of the City, provided, however, that the City shall not be liable to Grantee should Grantee construct facilities pursuant to this grant on an area which the City has erroneously exercised dominion and control. 
Section 3. - Grantee's Compliance with City Practice; Plans Submitted for Approval; City Construction Near Grantee's Facilities: 
    Grantee shall perform all construction under this Franchise in accordance with the City's established practices, duly adopted standards or as required by permits, which may incorporate special standards when required for City purposes with respect to such public rights-of-way. Without limitation, Grantee shall comply with ordinances of the City regarding street cuts. Such construction shall be completed within a reasonable time. Before Grantee makes any installations in the public rights-of-way, Grantee shall apply for and obtain from the City such permit or permits as are required by the City (pursuant to the City Street Code Chapter 23 of the City Code) to be issued for other similar construction or work in the public rights-of-way, pay applicable permit fees, and submit for approval a map showing the location of such proposed installations to the City Engineer/Engineering Director. The City shall issue such permit or permits to the Grantee on such conditions as are reasonable and necessary to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of this Franchise. Unless necessitated by emergency or exigent circumstances, should Grantee commence work hereunder without obtaining applicable permits, then Grantee shall pay to the City, in addition to applicable permit fees, a stipulated penalty of equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the applicable permit fees. Upon request, Grantee shall also provide the City with, on an annual basis, their known proposed capital plan and reasonably foreseeable future corridor plans for all improvements in the City's planning area. 
    If the City undertakes, either directly or through a contractor, any construction project adjacent to Grantee's facilities operated pursuant to this Franchise, the City shall notify Grantee of such construction project. Grantee will take steps as are reasonably necessary to maintain safe conditions throughout the construction project, including, but not limited to, the temporary removal or barricading of Grantee's pipelines or equipment, the location of which may create an unsafe condition in view of the equipment to be utilized or the methods of construction to be followed by the Contractor, at Grantee's cost. 
Section 4. - Construction and Relocation of Grantee's Facilities; Payment: 
    All facilities installed or constructed pursuant to this Franchise shall be so located or relocated and so erected as to minimize the interference with traffic and other authorized uses over, under or through the public rights-of-way. 
    Grantee shall coordinate the installation, construction, use, operation and relocation of its facilities within the City as appropriate to enable the City to better plan, facilitate and protect public safety and convenience. Without limiting the foregoing, Grantee shall provide reasonable advance notice of work hereunder to the City and any persons who may be affected by such work. Grantee shall provide the City with installation records to facilitate such coordination and shall plan, respond, facilitate and design its facilities in coordination with City input as the City may request or require for its purposes. Without limiting the foregoing, upon reasonable notice by the City of the proposed paving of a public right-of-way, Grantee shall extend its facilities hereunder in order to reasonably avoid the need to subsequently cut the paved right-of-way. Unless reasonably necessary due to emergency or exigent circumstances, Grantee shall not cut any City street for a period of three (3) years following construction, repaving, or widening of such street. 
    Grantee shall not install, construct, maintain or use its facilities in a manner that damages or interferes with any existing facilities of another utility located in the public right-of-way and agrees to relocate its facilities, if necessary, to accommodate another facility relocation that has a prior rights interest in the public rights-of-way. 
    Those phases of construction of Grantee's facilities relating to traffic control, backfilling, compaction and paving, as well as the location or relocation of lines and related facilities herein provided for shall be subject to regulation by the City. Grantee shall keep accurate installation records of the location of all facilities in the public rights-of-way and furnish them to the City upon request. Upon completion of new or relocation construction of underground facilities in the public rights-of-way, Grantee shall provide the City Engineer/Engineering Director with corrected drawings showing the actual location of the underground facilities in those cases where the actual location differs significantly from the proposed location. All underground abandoned lines shall continue to remain the property of the Grantee, unless the Grantee specifically acknowledges otherwise to the City Engineer/Engineering Director and such is accepted by the City. Subject to reimbursement under Section 8, Grantee shall remove, at Grantee's sole cost, abandoned lines at the request of the City when required to facilitate construction of any municipal project or as the City determines is reasonably necessary to protect public health and safety. Grantee may contract with the City contractor for such removal. Grantee shall maintain installation records pursuant to A.R.S. § 40-360.30. 
A.  If the City requires the Grantee to relocate Grantee's facilities, which are located in private easements obtained by Grantee prior to the City's acquisition of said property from which the facilities must be relocated, then: a) the costs and expenditures associated with relocating Grantee's facilities shall be borne by Grantee in accordance with Section 8 of this Franchise Agreement, except that b) the cost of purchasing of a new private easement, if necessary, shall be borne by the City provided, however, such relocation is not essential to the health, welfare and safety of the general public. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should the Grantee obtain an easement during (or prior to) the development stage of a parcel, the Grantee shall abandon the easement, and based on final development plans approved by the City, either (at the City's discretion) leave the facility as is, or relocate its utilities elsewhere within the future rights-of-way corridor. The development process is defined as the stage after a pre-application conference with the City, which has occurred on the subject property. 
B.  Except as covered in Paragraph A above, Grantee shall bear the entire cost of relocating its facilities located on public rights-of-way, subject to Section 8 of this Franchise Agreement, the relocation of which is necessary for the City's carrying out of its governmental functions. All functions of the City, which are not specifically determined by law to be proprietary are governmental. Governmental functions include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(1)  Any and all improvements to the City streets, alleys, avenues and City property; 
(2)  Establishing and maintaining domestic water systems, sanitary sewers, storm drains, water, and related facilities; 
(3)  Establishing and maintaining municipal parks, parking lots (or parking spaces), parkways, pedestrian malls, or grass, shrubs, trees and other vegetation for the purpose of landscaping any street or public property; 
(4)  Providing fire protection and other public safety functions; and 
(5)  Collection and/or disposal of garbage and recyclable materials. 
C.  The City reserves its prior superior right to use the public rights-of-way and City property, including the surface areas, for all public purposes, funded with public funds. When the City uses its prior superior right to the public rights-of-way, or other City property, the Grantee shall move its property that is located in the public rights-of-way, or on other City property, at its own cost, to such location as the City directs. 
D.  Subject to Section 8, Grantee, shall bear the entire cost of relocating any facilities regardless of the function served, where the City has a prior superior right to use the public rights-of-way, or where the City facilities or other facilities occupying public rights-of-way under authority of a City permit, license or franchise, which must be relocated are already located in the public rights-of-way and the conflict between the Grantee's potential facilities and the existing facilities can only be resolved expeditiously as determined by the City, by the movement of the existing City or permittee facilities. The City and the Grantee agree that the City is not a party to disputes among permittees using the public rights-of-way. 
E.  If the City participates in the cost of relocating Grantee's facilities for any reason, the cost to the City shall be limited to those costs and expenditures reasonably incurred for relocating such facilities in accordance with the City code and, where not in conflict therewith, industry standards. Costs to the City for relocation of Grantee's facilities shall not include any upgrade or improvement of Grantee's facilities as they existed prior to relocation. Prior to payment by the City, Grantee shall provide an itemization of such costs and expenditures. 
F.  The City will not exercise its right to require Grantee's facilities to be relocated in an unreasonable or arbitrary manner, or to avoid its obligations under this Franchise. 
G.  Grantee shall reimburse the City for permit fees/costs and for pavement (cut surcharge) damages fees for the location (or re-location) of Grantee's facilities. Reimbursement for permit fees/costs (i.e., plan review, inspection, location services, design costs, etc.) and pavement (cut surcharge) damage fees is separate, and in addition to, any other Franchise fees included in this Agreement. 
Section 5. - Indemnification: 
    The City shall in no way be liable to or responsible for any accident or damage that may occur in the exercise of this Franchise by Grantee of its facilities under this Franchise, and the acceptance of this grant shall be deemed an agreement on the part of Grantee to indemnify and hold harmless the City from and against any and all liability, loss, costs, legal fees, damages or any other expenses, which may be imposed on the City by reason of the acts of the Grantee in the exercise of this Franchise, including the maintenance of barricades and traffic control devices in construction and maintenance areas. Grantee shall defend, indemnify, and save the City harmless from any expenses and losses incurred as a result of injury or damage to third persons occasioned by the exercise of this Franchise by Grantee, provided, however, that such claims, expenses and losses are not the result of any willfully or grossly negligent acts of the City. 
    Grantee shall have and maintain throughout the term of this Franchise liability insurance and/or a program of self-retention or general assets to adequately insure and/or protect the legal liability of the Grantee with reference to the installation, operation and maintenance of the gas lines, together with all the necessary and desirable appurtenances authorized herein to occupy the public rights-of-way. Such insurance, self-retention or general asset program will provide protection for bodily injury and property damage including contractual liability and legal liability for damages arising from explosion, collapse and underground incidents. Such insurance program and/or program of self-retention or general assets shall comply with the Insurance Requirement recommended by the Risk Manager and approved by the City Manager on file with the City Clerk and as updated by the City Manager during the term of this Franchise. 
    Grantee shall file with the City documentation of such liability insurance, self-retention or general asset program within sixty (60) days following the effective date of this Franchise and thereafter upon request of the City. 
Section 6. - Restoration of Rights-of-Way: 
    If, in the installation, use or maintenance of its natural gas transmission and distribution system Grantee damages or disturbs the surface or subsurface of any public road or adjoining public property or the public improvement located thereon, therein, or thereunder, the Grantee shall promptly, at its own expense (subject to Sections 7 and 8 of this Franchise Agreement), and in a manner acceptable to the City, restore the surface or subsurface of the public road or public property, or repair or replace the public improvement thereon, therein, or thereunder, in as good a condition as before such damage or disturbance, or as may be required by construction standards established by the City issued permit in accordance with Chapter 23 of the City code (as amended) 
    Except due to circumstances beyond Grantee's control, should such restoration, repair or replacement not be completed within a reasonable time or pursuant to the City issued permit or fail to meet the City's duly adopted standards, as may be amended from time to time, the City may, after prior notice to Grantee, perform the necessary restoration, repair or replacement either through its own forces or through a hired contractor, and Grantee agrees to reimburse the City for the expense it incurred in performing the necessary restoration, repair or replacement within thirty (30) days after receipt of an invoice from the City. 
Section 7. - Franchise Fee: 
    Grantee shall pay to the City in consideration of the grant of this Franchise a sum equal to two percent (2%) of its gross revenues derived from the sale at retail by it of natural gas (as defined in Section 2, above) for residential, commercial and industrial purposes/customers, within the present or any future corporate limits of the City as shown by Grantee's billing records. Such payments are to be due and payable monthly and postmarked on or before the twentieth (20 th ) calendar day from the end of he preceding month in which the franchise fee accrues. In the event the payment is received later than the last business day of the month, a five percent (5%) penalty shall be added to payments not made within the required time, and interest of one point five percent (1.5%) monthly shall accrue on the entire amount due. The interest and penalty may be waived by the City if the failure to postmark by the due date was the result of a casualty that renders Grantee unable to compute or estimate the liability from the business records. For the purpose of verifying amounts payable hereunder, the books and records of Grantee shall be subject to inspection or audit by duly authorized officers or representatives of the City at reasonable times. 
    Grantee shall pay Franchise Fees pursuant to the terms of the previously executed Franchise Agreement between Grantee and the City through May 13, 2005. Beginning May 14, 2005, payment as described in the preceding paragraphs shall be payable in monthly amounts within twenty (20) days after the end of each calendar month. 
    Notwithstanding the provisions of this Franchise, if at any time Grantee is paying any municipality in the State of Arizona a Franchise Fee greater than two percent (2%) of Grantee's gross receipts in such municipality, then, the percentage set forth in this Section 7 shall be automatically increased to match the greater percentage amount Grantee is paying to such other municipality pursuant under a franchise agreement. 
    In addition to the foregoing Franchise Fees, Grantee shall pay charges, taxes, and fees as described in Section 8 of this Agreement. 
Section 8. - Additional Fees and Taxes: 
    Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary, Grantee shall pay, in addition to the payment provided in Sections 4G and 7, the following charges, taxes and fees as established in a code or ordinance properly adopted by the City: 
(a)  general ad valorem property taxes; 
(b)  transaction privilege and use tax authorized by law and collected by Grantee for its retail sales from users and consumers of natural gas within the present and any future corporate limits of the City, without reduction or offset; 
(c)  other charges, taxes (except transaction privilege and use tax mentioned above) or fees levied upon businesses generally through the City, provided said charge, tax or fee is a flat fee per year and that the annual amount of such fee does not exceed the amount of similar fees paid by any other businesses operated within the City; and 
(d)  applicable and customary permit and inspection fees (i.e., plan review, inspection, location services, design costs, etc.) and pavement (cut surcharge) damage fees, established by ordinance of the City, necessary for the construction, installation, and other work to be conducted by Grantee hereunder. 
    In addition to and separate from the Franchise Fee set forth above, the City and the Grantee agree that the City shall assess additional compensation to be paid by Grantee to the City in monthly payments in the amount equal to two percent (2%) of the gross revenues of Grantee as defined in Section 7 of this Agreement. The City shall place all funds collected from Grantee due to such additional compensation in a special fund labeled "Capital Expenditures Fund." Upon presentation to the City of documentation by Grantee of the Grantee's incurring of such capital expenditures and approval by the City, the City shall pay the Grantee within thirty (30) days of such approval, if the amount of money in the Capital Expenditures Fund is sufficient to pay the approved capital expenditures. In the event there is a surplus of the Capital Expenditures Fund after the City pays Grantee, such surplus shall be set aside for the City. 
    The Grantee shall provide the City assurances that the payments by the City from the Capital Expenditures Fund will not result in Grantee adding such reimbursed capital expenditures to its rate base or seeking a return on investment for such reimbursed capital expenditures. 
    To the extent that the additional compensation generated by this section is insufficient to cover the anticipated capital expenditures, the City and Grantee shall agree to modify the additional compensation to generate sufficient funds to meet the reasonable capital expenditures in the future years plus any expenditures approved, but not paid due to lack of funds in the Capital Expenditures Fund. The Grantee assures the City that all taxes and other fees or charges shall remain combined and bundled as "taxes and other fees" or "taxes and other charges" on Grantee's invoices/statements unless mandated otherwise by law. 
    For purposes of this Franchise Agreement, capital expenditures subject to reimbursement by the City, consist of any cost or expenditure required by this Franchise Agreement or any ordinance adopted by the City related to this Franchise Agreement, including without limitation, fees and costs for permanent and temporary relocations and general construction for natural gas mains, vaults, and laterals; fees and costs associated with backfilling, compaction, pavement cutting, surface restoration repair or replacement: line location, line exposure, traffic control; and permit fees, plan review fees, design fees and inspection fees. 
Section 9. - Term: 
    This Franchise shall continue and exist for a period of twenty-five (25) years from the day of May 14, 2005; provided, however, that if at any time Grantee is paying to any municipality in the State of Arizona a Franchisee Fee greater than two percent (2%) of Grantee's gross receipts in such municipality, then the percentage set forth in Section 7 shall be increased to match such greater percentage amount payable to such municipality and provided further that, if at any time Grantee provides other enhancements or benefits to any municipality in the State of Arizona, then such enhancements or benefits shall also be provided to the City. 
    The right, privilege and franchise hereby granted shall continue and exist for a period of twenty-five (25) years; provided, however, that either party may terminate this Franchise on its tenth (10 th ) anniversary by giving written notice of its intention to do so not less than one (1) year before the date of termination. If such notice is given for the purpose of negotiating a new franchise and such negotiation is successful, the party giving the notice of termination shall be responsible for the costs of the resulting franchise election. 
Section 10. - Franchise; Non-Exclusive:

Nothing herein shall prevent the Director of Public Works from restricting construction to certain designated hours and days based on traffic control and impact on surrounding areas. 
(b)  In the event that Utility fails to repair the public right-of-way to a safe and satisfactory condition, normal wear and tear excepted and reasonably satisfactory to the City's Public Works Director, the City shall have the option upon fifteen (15) days' prior written notice to Utility to perform or cause to be performed such reasonable and necessary work on behalf of Utility and to charge Utility for the proposed costs to be incurred or the actual costs incurred by the City at City's standard rates, plus an administrative fee of fifteen percent (15)%.

Section 8. - Occupation Tax. 
    Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary, Utility shall, in addition to the aforementioned payment, pay any business or occupation tax established by City and not levied by City exclusively upon Utilities, provided the tax is a flat fee per year and that the annual amount of such fee does not exceed the amount of similar fees paid by the other businesses with comparable gross revenue from sales operated within City. 
Section 9. - Election, Term and Acceptance. 
(a)  The right, privilege and franchise hereby granted shall continue and exist for a period of fifteen (15) years from the date of the granting hereof; provided, however, that either party may terminate the franchise on its tenth anniversary by giving written notice of its intention to do so not less than one (1) year before the date of termination.

Utility shall obtain and maintain at all times during the term of this franchise statutory workers' compensation and employer's liability insurance in an amount not less than Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) and shall furnish City with a certificate showing proof of such coverage,

Sec. 6. - Restoration of Rights-of-Way. 
(a)  Except as hereinafter provided with regard to repairs of Utility facilities, whenever Utility shall cause any opening or alteration whatever to be made for any purpose in any public right-of-way owned or maintained by City, Utility shall apply for and obtain a right-of-way permit from City and shall provide for inspection of the right-of-way by City. When time does not permit prior application for a permit and repairs to Utility's facilities are reasonably required, Utility first may institute and complete the repairs and then complete and file the right-of-way permit application. In this case, telephone notification of the repair will be given as soon as practicable to the contact person designated by the City. Utility shall complete all work with due diligence within a reasonably prompt time, and Utility shall, upon completion of such work, restore the property disturbed back to as good condition as it was prior to such openings or alteration in accordance with the specifications for public works adopted by City. Utility shall comply with the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices and the City of Phoenix Barricade Manual and shall bear the full cost of any barricades, signing, rerouting of traffic, or other action or expense that City shall consider necessary or desirable in the interest of public safety during any such opening or alteration within the public right-of-way and shall bear the full cost of removal of barricades and traffic control devices upon completion of construction, including but not limited to any storage cost incurred by City in holding barricades removed to prevent obstruction to traffic. Nothing herein shall prevent the Director of Public Works-Utilities from restricting construction to certain designated hours and days based on traffic control and impact on surrounding areas. 
(b)  In the event that Utility fails to repair the public right-of-way to a safe and satisfactory condition, normal wear and tear excepted and reasonably satisfactory to the City's Public Works-Utilities Director, the City shall have the option upon fifteen (15) days prior written notice to Utility to perform or cause to be performed such reasonable and necessary work on behalf of Utility and to charge Utility for the proposed costs to be incurred or the actual costs incurred by the City at City's standard rates, plus an administrative fee of fifteen percent. Upon the receipt of such a demand for payment by the City, Utility shall within thirty (30) days reimburse the City for such costs. Unpaid amounts after thirty (30) days shall bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month. 
Sec. 7. - Franchise Fee. 
(a)  In consideration of the granting of the rights under this franchise, Utility agrees to pay to the City, a sum equal to two percent (2%) of the gross receipts of Utility within the City (excluding from gross receipts all sales taxes, gross revenue taxes or similar charges based upon gross receipts), from sale by it of water and wastewater service within the present and any future corporate limits of City, as shown by Utility's billing records (the "Fee"). This Fee shall be due and payable monthly and shall be in lieu of all fees or charges for permits or licenses issued for the construction of Utility's facilities hereunder (except for inspection fees relating to new installation of equipment in City rights-of-way). Notwithstanding the foregoing, fees charged by the City for pavement damage resulting from cuts into new or rehabilitated pavement in accordance with Chapter 23 of the Peoria City Code (1992) shall be permitted. For the purpose of verifying the amounts payable hereunder, the pertinent books and records of Utility shall be subject to inspection by duly authorized officers or representatives of City upon reasonable notice during regular business hours. 
(b)  The City charges an additional Transaction Privilege Tax for the utilities classification at the rate of 3.3% on gross revenues of Utility, which shall not be deducted from the Fee. 
Sec. 8. - Occupation Tax. 
    Notwithstanding any provision contained herein to the contrary, Utility shall, in addition to the payment provided in Section 7, pay any business or occupation tax established by City and not levied by City exclusively upon utilities, provided the tax is a flat fee per year and that the annual amount of such fee does not exceed the amount of similar fees paid by the other businesses with comparable gross revenue from sales within City. 
Sec. 9. - Election, Term and Acceptance. 
(a)  The right, privilege, and franchise hereby granted shall continue and exist for a period of fifteen (15) years from the date of the granting hereof 
(b)  Utility shall be responsible for the costs of the required franchise election. If the franchise is the only item on the ballot, Utility shall pay all City costs. If more than one franchise or item is on the ballot, each franchise will pay a pro-rata share of the total based on the total number of items on the ballot. 
(c)  The franchise shall be void and of no effect if written acceptance thereof by the Utility is not filed in the Office of the City Clerk of City within sixty (60) days after it is granted. 
Sec. 10. - Transfer of Franchise. 
    The right, privilege, and franchise hereby granted may not be transferred in whole or in part by Utility, its successors and assigns, without the prior consent of both the Peoria City Council and the Arizona Corporation Commission and payment of an appropriate transfer fee to the City to reimburse City for any reasonable costs it incurs in processing the transfer. The Peoria City Council's consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. No consent shall be required in connection with an assignment made as security pursuant to a mortgage or deed of trust or in connection with subsequent transfer made pursuant to any such instrument. 
Sec. 11. - Franchise Not Exclusive. 
    This grant is not exclusive, and nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent the City from granting other like or similar grants or privileges to any other person, firm, or corporation. 
Sec. 12. - Repealer. 
    All ordinances and parts of ordinances previously granting this Utility a Franchise and which are in conflict with the provisions hereof, are hereby repealed. 
Sec. 13. - Severability. 
    If any section, paragraph, clause, phrase or provision of the franchise, other than Section 7, shall be adjudged invalid or unconstitutional, the same shall not affect the validity of the franchise as a whole or any part of the provisions hereof other than the part so adjudged to be invalid or unconstitutional. If Section 7 shall be adjudged invalid or unconstitutional in whole or in part by a final judgment, the franchise shall immediately terminate and shall be of no further force or effect. 
Sec. 14. - Title to Facilities; Right to Use Easements; Reserved Right to Purchase or Condemn. 
(a)  Title to all water and wastewater utility facilities wherever situated on public grounds or in easements for public utility purposes and installed by Utility or its agents or contractors shall be and remain in Utility, its successors, or assigns. 
(b)  Nothing contained in this franchise shall be construed as preventing, diminishing, or restricting Utility from using for public utility purposes any easement shown on any plat or plats of any portion of the City before or hereafter platted or recorded that has been or may hereafter be created, granted, or dedicated for public utility purposes by any person, firm, or corporation. The costs associated with such use shall be borne by Utility. The City shall have the right to deny Utility the uses of restricted easements limited to sewer or drainage or easements not wide enough to accommodate a City Water Line and Utility Water Line. 
(c)  The City reserves the right and power to purchase and condemn the plant and distribution facilities of the Utility within the corporate limits or any additions thereto, as provided by law. Utility likewise reserves all of its rights and remedies provided by law in any such circumstance. 
(d)  In the event of a purchase of Utility or under the exercises of eminent domain, this franchise agreement shall be construed to have no value for purposes of establishing value of Utility. 
Sec. 15. - Submission to Qualified Electors. 
    Upon adoption of this Ordinance by the Mayor and Council, the question of whether to issue a franchise to Utility in accordance with the terms of this Ordinance shall be submitted to the qualified electors of City at an election to be held on August 24, 2010 and the City Clerk and City Attorney upon approval are authorized to take all steps necessary to accomplish submission of this item to the qualified electors of City.
