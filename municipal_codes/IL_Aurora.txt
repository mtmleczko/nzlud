PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Aurora of a general and permanent nature. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1969 Code, as supplemented, and ordinances adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1969 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinances included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. At the request of the city the basic format of the 1969 Code has been preserved insofar as possible; therefore, chapters have been reserved in an effort to have chapters coincide with those in the 1969 Code. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in any state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the four hundred and seventy-sixth section of Chapter 2 is 2-476. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 2-476 and 2-477 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 2-476.1, 2-476.2, and 2-476.3 respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If new material is to be included between Chapters 6 and 7, it will be designated as Chapter 6.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Index 
    The index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officers and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Supervising Editor, and Laura Johnson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Mayor David L. Pierce, Corporation Counsel, Ronald R. Moses, City Attorney, Michael B. Weinstein, First Assistant City Attorney, Steven L. Kadden, City Clerk, Eva M. Rodgers, and Legal Assistant, Lynne C. Ratz, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publishers have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

ADOPTING ORDINANCE 
ORDINANCE NO. O88-71 
An Ordinance Adopting and Enacting a New Code for the City of Aurora, Illinois; Providing for the Repeal of Certain Ordinances Not Included Therein, Except as Otherwise Specified; Providing a Penalty for Violations Thereof; Providing for the Manner of Amending Said Code; and Providing When This Ordinance Shall Become Effective. 
    Whereas, the City of Aurora has a population of more than 25,000 persons and is, therefore, a home rule unit under subsection (a) of Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution of 1970; and 
    Whereas, subject to said Section, a home rule unit may exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs for the protection of the public health, safety, morals and welfare; and 
    Whereas, the present City Code was adopted in March, 1969, and has been amended from time-to-time thereafter; and 
    Whereas, the present City Code was adopted prior to the advent of constitutional home rule in Illinois and contains certain provisions which have become obsolete due to home rule as well as the passage of time. 
    Now, Therefore, Be It Ordained by the City Council of the City of Aurora, Kane and DuPage Counties, Illinois, as follows: 
    Section One: The Code entitled the "Code of Ordinances, City of Aurora, Illinois" (hereafter referred to as "the Code") published in 1988 by Municipal Code Corporation and consisting of Chapters 1 through 48, each inclusive, is hereby adopted and enacted. 
    Section Two: All City of Aurora ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted on or before February 26, 1988, and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein or in this ordinance, are hereby repealed; provided however, that those additions and corrections set forth in Exhibit A, attached hereto and made a part hereof are included in the Code as if specifically set forth therein. 
    Section Three: The repeal provided for in Section Two hereof shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance that is repealed by this ordinance. 
    Section Four: Nothing in the Code or this ordinance adopting the Code shall affect any offense or act committed or done, or any penalty or forfeiture incurred, or any contract or right established or accruing before the effective date of the Code. Furthermore, the adoption of the Code shall not be interpreted as permitting any use or the continuance of any use of a structure or premises in violation of any ordinance of the city in effect on the date of adoption of the Code. 
    Section Five: Nothing in the Code or this ordinance adopting the Code shall affect any ordinance: 
(1)  Promising or guaranteeing the payment of money for the city, or authorizing the issuance of any bonds of the city or any evidence of the city's indebtedness, or contract or obligations assumed by the city; 
(2)  Granting any right or franchise; 
(3)  Dedicating, naming, establishing, locating, relocating, opening, paving, widening, vacating, etc., any street or public way in the city; 
(4)  Making any appropriation or providing for a budget, budget amendment or transfer of funds; 
(5)  Levying or imposing taxes not contained in the Code; 
(6)  Establishing or prescribing grades of streets in the city; 
(7)  Providing for local improvements and assessing taxes therefor; 
(8)  Dedicating or accepting any plat or subdivision in the city; 
(9)  Extending or contracting the boundaries of the city; 
(10)  Prescribing the number, classification, benefits or compensation of any city officers or employees, not inconsistent herewith; 
(11)  Relating to zoning; 
(12)  Regulating or prohibiting traffic or parking on any particular streets or in any particular area, or specifying or designating off-street parking lots; 
(13)  Creating specific funds; 
(14)  Which is temporary although general in effect; 
(15)  Which is special although permanent in effect; 
(16)  The purpose of which has been accomplished; 
and all such ordinances are hereby recognized as continuing in full force and effect to the same extent as if set out at length in the Code. 
    Section Six: That whenever in the Code or in any ordinance of the city any act is prohibited or made or declared to be unlawful or a misdemeanor, or whenever in the Code or ordinance the doing of any act is required or the failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful or a misdemeanor, where no specific penalty is provided therefor, the violation of any such provision of the code or any ordinance shall be punishable by a fine of not less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) and not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00). Each day any violation of any provisions of the Code or of any ordinance shall continue shall constitute a separate offense. 
    Notwithstanding all other provisions of the Code, if a summons for a violation of an ordinance of this city or the Code is served by certified mail, return receipt requested, the maximum penalty which may be imposed for such violation shall be a fine of two hundred dollars ($200.00). 
    In all cases where the same offense is made punishable or is created by different clauses or sections of the Code or other ordinance, the prosecuting officer may elect under which to proceed; but not more than one (1) recovery shall be had against the same person for the same offense, provided that the revocation of a license or permit shall not be considered a recovery or penalty so as to bar any other penalty being enforced. 
    No provision of the Code designating the duties of any city officer or city employee shall be so construed so as to make such officer or employee liable for any fine or penalty provided in the Code for a failure to perform such duty, unless the intention of the city council to impose such a fine or penalty on such officer or employee is specifically and clearly expressed in the section creating the duty. In this paragraph, "city employee" includes any member of a board, commission or committee of the city, city servant or employee, whether or not compensated, but does not include an independent contractor. 
    Section Seven: That all additions and amendments to the Code, when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the City to make the same a part of the Code, shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code includes said additions and amendments. 
    Section Eight: That all ordinances adopted after February 26, 1988, that amend or refer to ordinances that have been codified in the Code shall be construed to amend or refer to the applicable provisions of the Code. 
    Section Nine: That this ordinance is an exercise of the home rule powers granted to the City of Aurora by Article VII, Section 6 of the Illinois Constitution of 1970. 
    Section Ten: That this ordinance shall be in full force and effect, and shall be controlling, on and after July 1, 1988. 
    Section Eleven: That all ordinances or parts of ordinances thereof in conflict herewith are, to the extent of such conflict, hereby repealed.

DIVISION 2. - ETHICAL STANDARDS AND DISCLOSURE OF ECONOMIC INTERESTS 

Sec. 2-181. - Statement of policy. 
(a)  It is the policy of the city that in all cases its officers and employees perform their duties for the sole benefit of the citizens of the city. They shall conduct the affairs of the city with integrity and impartiality, without allowing prejudice, favoritism or the opportunity for personal gain to influence their decisions or actions or to interfere with serving the public interest. Continuing observance of this policy is essential to maintaining the public trust necessary for good government. The city council therefore adopts this division to establish guidelines for an ethical standard of conduct for officers and employees of the city and to ensure compliance with those guidelines. 
(b)  The standards of this division are intended to additionally supplement the provisions of section 3-14-4 of the Illinois Municipal Code [Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 24, ¶ 3-14-4] and section 3 of "An Act to prevent fraudulent and corrupt practices in the making or accepting of official appointments and contracts by public officers [Ill. Rev. Stat. Ch. 102, ¶ 3], and any other applicable state statutes and ordinances of the city relating to ethical conduct for municipal officers and employees. However, the obligations of this division shall not be limited to the statutory provisions specified hereinabove. 
(c)  The failure to include in this Code any provision of any statute or ordinance shall not be construed as an attempt to release city officers and employees from the obligations, responsibilities and penalties imposed by any such statute or ordinance. 
(Code 1969, § 2-351) 
Sec. 2-182. - Scope. 
    Except as expressly exempted, the provisions of this division shall apply to any officer or employee of the city whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid, including members and administrative staff of all boards and commissions appointed by the mayor or city council. The term "officer" applies throughout this division to the mayor and members of the city council; the term "employee" refers to all other persons covered by this division. 
(Code 1969, § 2-352) 
Sec. 2-183. - Standards of conduct. 
(a)  Compliance. Every officer and employee of the city shall be subject to and abide by the standards of conduct in this section. 
(b)  Impartiality. No officer or employee shall grant any special consideration, treatment or advantage to any person or business entity beyond that which is available to every other person or business entity which is similarly situated. 
(c)  Use of public property. No officer or employee shall request, use or permit the use of city funds, equipment, services, materials or property for personal convenience or profit, except when such are available to the public generally or are made available, by administrative authorization, to such officer or employee in the conduct of official city business. 
(d)  Conflicts of interest-Generally. No officer or employee shall engage in any business or transaction nor have an interest, direct or indirect, financial or otherwise, which is incompatible with the proper discharge of his official duties. For the purposes of this subsection, "interest" means the direct or indirect pecuniary or material benefit accruing to an officer or employee as a result of a contract or transaction which is or may be the subject of an official act or action by or with the city except for such contracts or transactions which by their terms or by the substance of their provisions confer the opportunity and right to realize the accrual of similar benefits to all other persons or property; or any such involvement arising from a blood or marriage relationship or direct business association. For the purposes of this subsection, an officer or employee shall be deemed to have an interest in the affairs of: 
(1)  Any person or business entity with whom a contractual relationship exists with the officer or employee, with regard to such relationship; 
(2)  Any business entity in which the officer or employee is an officer, director or member having a financial interest therein, or employed thereby; 
(3)  Any business entity the legal or beneficial ownership of which is controlled or owned directly or indirectly by the officer or employee. 
(e)  Same-Illustrative enumeration. Prohibited interests under subsection (d) expressly include, but are not limited to, the following examples: 
(1)  Gifts and favors. No officer or employee shall direct or indirectly solicit, accept or receive any gifts or favors whether in the form of money, services, loan, discount, travel, entertainment, hospitality, promise or other similar consideration in any other form, which gift or favor arises out of or is in any way related to such officer or employee's relationship with the city, and is in any way reasonably interpreted or expected to influence that officer or employee. 
(2)  Disclosure of confidential information. No officer or employee shall disclose or use information not officially available to the public concerning the property, government or affairs of the city to advance the financial or other private interests of himself or others. 
(3)  Pecuniary interests in city business or contracts. No officer or employee shall have a pecuniary or material interest, directly or indirectly, in any contract, work or business of the city or in the sale of any article, whenever the expense, price, or consideration of the contract, work, business or sale is paid either from the city treasury or by an assessment levied by any statute or ordinance. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, no officer or employee shall have a pecuniary or material interest, directly or indirectly, in the purchase of any property which belongs to the city, or is sold for taxes or assessments, or is sold by virtue of legal process at the suit of the city; provided, however, that officers and employees, shall be allowed to bid at auction or competitive bidding open to the general public and thereafter purchase city property. 
(4)  Representing private interests before city bodies or courts. No officer or employee shall represent or appear on behalf of private interests other than his own before any city body or department nor represent any such private interests in any litigation to which the city is a party; provided, however, an employee may represent other employees in personnel matters as provided in the city's personnel code and civil service rules; and provided further, an officer may appear, without receiving additional compensation therefor, on behalf of constituents in the course of his duties as a representative of the electorate, or in the performance of public or civic obligations. 
(5)  Incompatible outside occupations or employment. In this paragraph, "outside occupation or employment" means any paid or unpaid occupation or employment other than the performance of official city duties, including, but not limited to, self-employment, working for another, rendering of services for other than the city, and employment or involvement in the management, operation or direction of any enterprise, public or private. No employee shall engage in or accept an outside occupation or employment when such occupation or employment tends to create a conflict with or impair the proper and impartial discharge of the person's official responsibilities. Such prohibited occupations or employments include, but are not limited to, those which: 
a.  Are of such a nature as to be reasonably construed by the public to be an official act of the city; 
b.  Are of such a nature that the employee would be expected to perform it as a part of his official responsibilities; 
c.  Involve management of an enterprise or business closely related to or tending to involve the employee's official responsibilities; or 
d.  Would tend to influence the employee's impartial judgment in the exercise of his official responsibilities.

Sec. 5-40. - Airport-referenced imaginary surfaces. 
(a)  In order to carry out the purposes of this article there are established five (5) airport-referenced imaginary surfaces, as shown on the map, which consist of and are described as follows: 
(1)  Datum plane. The datum plane is a horizontal plane or surface, which includes the surface point of the airport elevation established to be at seven hundred six (706) feet above mean sea level. 
(2)  Approach surfaces (noninstrument runways). The approach surfaces are inclined planes located directly above the approach area, extending upward and outward from its point of beginning at the near end of the runway or landing strip, at a slope ratio of one (1) foot vertical to forty (40) feet horizontal, or at an angle of 1° 25' 56? from the horizontal, such approach area being symmetrically located with respect to the extended runway or landing strip centerline. The dimensions of the approach area are measured horizontally as follows: 
 A length of ten thousand (10,000) feet beginning two hundred (200) feet from the end of the runway or one hundred (100) feet from the end of the landing strip, and extending outward, ending at a point ten thousand two hundred (10,200) feet from the end of the runway or ten thousand one hundred (10,100) feet from the end of the landing strip on the extended centerline of the runway or landing strip; a total width of four hundred (400) feet at the end nearest to the runway or landing strip and flared uniformly to a total width of two thousand four hundred (2,400) feet at the end of the ten-thousand-foot section. 
(3)  Approach surfaces (instrument landing system runway). The approach surfaces for all designated instrument landing system runways are inclined planes, located directly above the approach area, extending upward and outward from its point of beginning at the near end of the runway at a slope ratio of one (1) foot vertical to fifty (50) feet horizontal, or at an angle of 1° 08' 45? from the horizontal, for the first ten thousand (10,000) feet, and thence continuing upward and outward at a slope ratio of one (1) foot vertical to forty (40) feet horizontal, or at an angle of 1° 25' 56? from the horizontal, such approach area being symmetrically located with respect to the extended runway centerline. The dimensions of the approach area are measured horizontally and encompass the following area: 
 A length of fifty thousand (50,000) feet beginning two hundred (200) feet from the end of the runway or one hundred (100) feet from the end of the landing strip, and extending outward, ending at a point fifty thousand two hundred (50,200) feet from the end of the runway, or fifty thousand one hundred (50,100) feet from the end of the landing strip, on the extended centerline of the runway; and having a total width of one thousand (1,000) feet at the end nearest the runway or landing strip and flared uniformly to a total width of sixteen thousand (16,000) feet at the end of the fifty-thousand-foot section. 
(4)  Horizontal surfaces. The horizontal surfaces are horizontal planes, circular in shape, having a radius of eleven thousand five hundred (11,500) feet from the airport reference point, at its outer limits but excluding the approach and transition surfaces, insofar as they are contained within such eleven thousand five hundred (11,500) feet radius, and which together with the conical surface form the upper boundary of the turning zone. 
(5)  Conical surfaces. The conical surfaces extend upward and outward from the outer limits of the horizontal surfaces. Measuring radially outward from the outer limits of the horizontal surfaces, the conical surfaces extend for a horizontal distance of seven thousand (7,000) feet. 
(6)  Transition surfaces. The transition surfaces are inclined planes, symmetrically located about the centerline of the runway or landing strip, extending from the lateral boundaries of all approach surfaces upward and outward, at a slope ratio of one (1) foot vertical to seven (7) feet horizontal or at an angle of 8° 07' 48? from the horizontal, to the intersection with the horizontal or conical surface. Transition surfaces also extend outward and upward at the same slope ratio and angle noted above beginning at any point five hundred (500) feet normal to and at the elevation of the centerline of noninstrument runways, extending two hundred (200) feet beyond each end thereof, and five hundred (500) feet normal to and at the elevation of the centerline of the instrument runway, extending two hundred (200) feet beyond each end thereof, and extended until they intersect the horizontal surface. 
 With relation to a runway designated for instrument operation, the approach surfaces projecting through and beyond the outer limits of the conical surfaces have a transition surface extending upward and outward at a slope ratio of one (1) foot vertical to seven (7) feet horizontal, or at an angle of 8° 07' 48? from the horizontal, for a distance of five thousand (5,000) feet measured horizontally from the edges of the approach surfaces and at right angles to the extended runway centerline.

The reference elevation for determination and establishment of the height limits for the approach and transition surfaces shall be the elevations of the near end of the respective runway or landing strip, as the case may be. 
(b)  The height limit for each type zone is established as follows: 
(1)  Noninstrument approach surface zones. One (1) foot of height for every forty (40) feet in horizontal distance, measured outward from the inner boundary of the respective approach surfaces. 
(2)  Instrument approach surface zones. One (1) foot of height for every fifty (50) feet in horizontal distance, measured outward ten thousand (10,000) feet from the inner boundary of the respective approach surfaces. The area extending from the outer boundary of the respective approach surfaces continuing at the rate of one (1) foot of height for every forty (40) feet of horizontal distance. 
(3)  Horizontal surface zones. One hundred fifty (150) feet above the established airport elevation. 
(4)  Conical surface zones. One (1) foot of height for every twenty (20) feet in horizontal distance, measured outward from the inner boundary of the respective conical surfaces, to a height of five hundred (500) feet.

(c)  In addition to the foregoing, no object, structure or growth which would constitute an obstruction to air navigation by reason of its height shall be erected, altered, allowed to grow or be maintained in any zone created by this article. An existing object, structure or growth, including a mobile object, is, and a future object, structure or growth would be, an obstruction to air navigation if it is of greater height than any of the following heights or surfaces: 
(1)  A height of five hundred (500) feet above ground level at the site of the construction or alteration, within certain limits. 
(2)  A height that is two hundred (200) feet above ground level or above the established airport elevation, whichever is higher, within three (3) statute miles of the established reference point of an airport, excluding heliports, with its longest runway more than three thousand two hundred (3,200) feet in length, and that height increases in the proportion of one hundred (100) feet for each additional statute mile of distance from the airport up to a maximum of five hundred (500) feet. 
(3)  A height that is one hundred (100) feet above ground level or one hundred (100) feet above the elevation of the approach, and of the runway, whichever is higher, within an instrument approach area and within three (3) statute miles of the runway end, and that height increases in the proportion of twenty-five (25) feet for each additional statute mile of distance outward from the runway end up to a maximum of two hundred fifty (250) feet and continuing at that height to a distance of ten (10) statute miles from the runway end. 
(4)  A height which would increase an instrument approach minimum flight altitude.

(2)  Where it is desired to increase the height of any structure which already projects upward to a point which is less than ten (10) feet below the height limit within any zone created by this article; provided, that in any such instance it is determined by the airport zoning board that such structure should be marked or lighted in the interest of safe air navigation, the airport zoning board may make a condition to the granting of any such permit that marking or lighting should be accomplished as it shall direct, and the cost and expense of installation, operation and maintenance shall be allocated between the authority and the owner as the circumstances may require. 
(3)  Where it is desired to erect a new or additional structure that will project upward to a point that is less than ten (10) feet below the height limit within any zone created by this article; provided, that in any such instance it is determined by the airport zoning board that such structure should be marked or lighted in the interest of safe air navigation, the airport zoning board may make a condition to the granting of any such permit that marking or lighting shall be accomplished as it shall direct, and the cost and expense of installation, operation and maintenance shall be paid by the owner. 
(b)  Application. 
(1)  Application for such permit shall be made to the airport zoning board. 
(2)  Each such application shall indicate the purpose for which the permit is desired with sufficient particularity to permit a determination of whether the structure will conform to the regulations prescribed in this article. 
(c)  Exceptions. Where an emergency installation, repair or replacement is required to be made by any public utility company, which would ordinarily require a permit as above set forth, but the interest of the public from the standpoint of health, safety or general welfare does not permit sufficient time to obtain such permit, then in that event the requirement shall not apply, but a written report shall be given to the airport zoning board immediately upon commencement of such alteration or erection, setting forth the facts relating thereto with sufficient particularity to permit a determination as to whether such structure conforms to the regulations prescribed in this article. 
(d)  Nonconforming uses abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the airport zoning board determines that a nonconforming structure or growth has been abandoned or more than eighty (80) percent has been torn down, physically deteriorated or decayed, no permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or growth to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. The airport zoning board may by appropriate action compel the owner of the nonconforming structure or growth, at his own expense, to lower, remove, reconstruct or equip such project as may be necessary to conform to such regulations. If the owner of the nonconforming structure or growth shall neglect or refuse to comply with such an order after ten (10) days' notice thereof, the airport zoning board may proceed to have the object so lowered, removed, reconstructed or equipped, and shall place a lien on behalf of the city upon the land whereon it is or was located, in the amount of the cost and expense thereof. Such lien may be enforced by the authority by suit in equity for the enforcement thereof, as in the case of other liens. Except as provided herein, all applications for permits or replacement, change or repair of nonconforming uses shall be granted. 
(e)  Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any structure, or permit a growth, or use his property, not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this article, may apply to the board of appeals for a variance from such regulations. Such variance shall be allowed where it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest and safety, but would do substantial justice and be in accordance with the spirit of this article; provided, that any variance may be allowed subject to any reasonable conditions that the board of appeals may deem necessary to effectuate the purposes of the article. 
(f)  Hazard marking and lighting as conditions of issuance. Any permit or variance granted may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this article and is reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of the structure or growth to install, operate and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary in the interest of safe air navigation, as shall be determined by the airport zoning board, to indicate to flyers the presence of any airport hazard. The cost and expense of the installation, operation and maintenance of same shall be paid by the owner.

A person who is habitually intoxicated may lack self-control as to the use of alcoholic beverages and use such beverages to the extent that their health is substantially impaired or endangered and their social or economic functioning is substantially disrupted. Such conduct is dangerous to the individual and to others. It is in the interest of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the City of Aurora to prohibit the harmful conduct of habitually intoxicated persons, and it is a reasonable exercise of the city's police powers to enforce these provisions to prohibit a retailer from selling alcoholic liquor to these habitually intoxicated persons. 
(2)  Definition. A known habitually intoxicated person is a person who, within the past one hundred eighty (180) days: 
(i)  Has been convicted of six (6) or more civil or criminal offenses, in which the police reports or other evidence indicate that the police officer who made the arrest determined, based upon the training and experience of the officer, that the person was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the commission of the offense, or 
(ii)  Has been transported and hospitalized six (6) or more times under conditions where the person appeared to be incapacitated by alcohol and in need of emergency treatment, or 
(iii)  Has been subject to any combination of arrests and convictions under subparagraph (i) and hospitalized under subparagraph (ii) that equals or exceeds six (6) times. 
(iv)  Where a person from the same incident has been both convicted of a civil or criminal offense, as defined in subparagraph (i), and has been hospitalized under subparagraph (ii), both the arrest and the hospitalization may be counted separately for the calculation provided in subparagraph (iii). 
(v)  A person may voluntarily request that their name be added to the list of known habitually intoxicated persons. Such a request shall be made in writing and shall be submitted to the police chief. 
(3)  Maintenance of list. 
(i)  The police chief or his designee shall maintain a list of known habitually intoxicated persons and shall, in his judgment, determine the format and content of the list. The chief or designee shall periodically review the format of the list. Whenever the chief determines that a person meets the definition of a known habitually intoxicated person, as provided in subparagraph (2), the chief or designee shall cause the name of that person to be placed on said list, as provided in this section, along with a photograph of the person, which reasonably represents the likeness of the person. 
(ii)  Petition for removal. If one hundred and eighty (180) days have passed from the time the name of a person has been placed on the list, and the person has not either been convicted of an offense under subparagraph (2) (i), or has not been hospitalized during that one hundred eighty (180) day period, that person may petition the chief to remove their name from the list, pursuant to this Section, by filing a written request with the city clerk, stating that they qualify for removal from the list. Upon verification that within the past one hundred eighty (180) days the person has not either been convicted of an offense under subparagraph (2) (i), or has not been hospitalized during that one hundred eighty (180) day period, the chief shall remove the name of the person from the list. 
(iii)  Removal by chief. On or about January 1 of each year, the chief or his designee shall review the list of known habitually intoxicated persons, and shall remove the names of all persons who during the prior six (6) months, has not been convicted of an offense under subparagraph (2) (i) and who has not been hospitalized.

The chief or designee shall keep a record of the date and time that the person was provided with such written notice. 
(5)  Appeals. 
(i)  A person who has been informed in writing by the chief or designee that their name will be placed on the list of known habitually intoxicated persons, may appeal the determination of the chief or designee by filing a written objection with the city clerk within five (5) business days of receiving the notice from the chief or designee. The content of an appeal shall be liberally construed so that, as long as the person appealing provides timely written notice that states that he or she objects to being placed on the list of known habitually intoxicated persons, the appeal shall be deemed to be in proper form. 
(ii)  Hearing officer. The local liquor control commissioner or the local liquor hearing officer shall serve as hearing officer for appeals under this section, and shall have authority to conduct hearings upon the filing of a written objection as provided herein. 
(iii)  Authority of hearing officer. The hearing officer shall have the authority to administer oaths and shall be responsible for the fair, orderly and impartial conduct of the hearing and the preservation of the exhibits and record therein.

(v)  Standard of proof. In the hearing, the chief or designee shall have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the person has been convicted of six (6) or more civil or criminal offenses, where the police reports or other evidence indicate that the person was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the commission of the offense; or that the person has been hospitalized six (6) or more times under conditions where the person appeared to be incapacitated by alcohol and in need of emergency treatment; or has been subject to any combination of convictions and hospitalizations that equals or exceeds six (6) times. If after the hearing, the hearing officer finds that there is not a preponderance of evidence of any combination of six (6) convictions or hospitalizations, as provided herein, the hearing officer shall enter an order granting the appeal and the chief or his designee shall remove the person's name from the list of known habitually intoxicated persons. If after the hearing, the hearing officer finds that there is a preponderance of the evidence that the person has been subject to any combination of six (6) or more convictions or hospitalizations, the hearing officer shall deny the appeal and the chief or his designee shall retain the persons' name on the list of known habitually intoxicated persons. 
(vi)  Finality of appeal. All orders of the hearing officer shall be final administrative determinations and shall be subject to review in court as by law may be provided from time to time. Any party to the proceeding may seek review thereof within thirty (30) days of service by mail of the final determination of the hearing officer. In addition, written notice of any request for judicial review shall be given by the party seeking review to all parties who appeared at the proceeding before the hearing officer, with said notice to be sent by first class mail to each party's last known address. The institution of the proceeding for judicial review shall not stay the decision and order of the hearing officer; however, the reviewing court may order a stay upon such terms as it deems proper.

If the city clerk has provided a copy of the most current list to the licensee, at the address of the licensee as listed by the city clerk, it shall not be a defense that the licensee did not have a copy of the most current list. If a licensee has no prior convictions for violation of this section, and has not previously received a warning, the local liquor commissioner shall formally warn the licensee that any future violations will result in a liquor violation hearing. The city clerk shall be responsible for maintaining a list of those licensees who have received warnings under this section.

Sec. 13.5-11. - Promotions. 
    The civil service commission shall, by its rules, provide for promotions in the classified service, on the basis of ascertained merit and seniority in service and examination, and shall provide, in all cases where it is practicable, that vacancies shall be filled by promotion. All examinations for promotion shall be competitive among such members of the next lower rank as desired to submit themselves to such examination; and it shall be the duty of the commission to submit to the appointing power the names of the six (6) applicants for each promotion having the highest rating; provided, however, that if there are less than six (6) persons in the next lower rank, the human resources director, acting in consultation with the appropriate department head, may promote from among those persons eligible.

The method of examination and the rules governing the same, and the method of certifying, shall be the same as provided for applicants for original appointment. 
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in either this Code or in state law, an individual who has been passed over the promotion for the last available vacancy to be filled from a particular promotional list may be submitted for any or all promotions to be made from the next succeeding promotional list; provided, however, that said individual has successfully passed the succeeding promotional exam and has been placed upon such list. Such individual shall be considered in addition to the six (6) applicants normally submitted for promotion.

Editor's note- Formerly section 33-51. 
Sec. 13.5-12. - Original and temporary appointments. 
(a)  When a position classified under this article is to be filled, the human resources director shall follow the applicable labor agreement requirements concerning job bidding. If the position in question is still vacant after said bidding requirements have been satisfied, the human resources director may, if the vacancy is not a police officer or fire fighter position, allow all other members of the classified and exempt service to bid on the vacant position. After the bidding procedures have been met and the vacancy still exists, the human resources director shall notify the civil service commission of that fact and the commission shall certify to the human resources director the names of the six (6) candidates standing highest upon the register of eligibles who are available for employment for the class or grade to which the position belongs. The human resources director, acting in consultation with the appropriate department head, shall fill each position by the appointment of one (1) of the six (6) persons certified to him by the commission. 
(b)  Whenever a register of eligibles for original appointment contains less than six (6) candidates, the personnel director may request that the civil service commission prepare and certify a superseding register. Upon such request, the commission shall, as expeditiously as is possible, prepare and certify such register. Any individuals who remain on the prior register shall be given notice of the preparation of the new register and shall be given the opportunity to take the appropriate examination based upon their prior application. Such notification of individuals shall occur no more than once. 
(c)  An original appointment shall be on probation for a period of six (6) months, but all time spent attending training schools and seminars, except appointments to the police department and fire department, shall be excluded in calculating the probation period. Appointments to sworn positions in the police department and fire department shall be on probation for a period of at least one (1) year, or as set forth in the relevant labor agreement. The commission may strike off names of candidates from the register after they have remained thereon more than two (2) years. At or before the expiration of the period of probation, the head of the department or office in which a candidate is employed may request the discharge of said candidate by presenting, in writing, the reasons for such request to the human resources director. A copy of the discharge request shall be contemporaneously served upon the probationary employee in person or by certified mail to the address on file with the human resources department. An affected employee may have an informal conference with the human resources director, provided that a request for such conference is made within three (3) business days of receipt of the discharge request. The employee may bring a representative of his choosing to the conference provided, however, that the name of the representative is given, in writing, to the human resources director at least two (2) business days prior to said conference. If, upon examination of the reasons for discharge, and after a conference if so requested, the human resources director concurs in the discharge request, the probationary employee shall then be discharged. The reason for such discharge shall be filed with the civil service commission for this information. Upon completion of the probationary period, the employee's appointment shall be deemed complete. 
(d)  To prevent the stoppage of public business, or to meet extraordinary emergencies, the personnel director may make a temporary appointment to remain in force not exceeding one hundred twenty (120) days and only until a regular appointment, under the provisions of this article, can be made. However, if such temporary appointee shall qualify upon the register of eligibles for the class or grade to which he is temporarily assigned during the period of such temporary assignment he may be permanently appointed irrespective of his ranking on the register for said class or grade. The civil service commission shall approve all such permanent appointments. Such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Such charges shall be investigated by or before the civil service commission, or by or before some officer or board appointed by the commission to conduct such investigation. The finding and decision of such commission or investigating officer or board, when approved by the commission, shall be certified to the appointing officer, and shall be forthwith enforced by such officer. 
(b)  Nothing in this article shall limit the power of any officer to suspend a subordinate for a reasonable period, not exceeding thirty (30) days, except that any employee or officer suspended for more than seven (7) days or suspended within six (6) months after a previous suspension shall be entitled upon request, to a hearing before the commission concerning the propriety of such suspension. 
(c)  In the course of investigation of charges, each member of the commission, and of any board so appointed by it, and any officer so appointed, shall have the power to administer oaths, and shall have power to secure by its subpoena both the attendance and testimony of witnesses, and the production of books and papers relevant to such investigation. 
(d)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to require such charges or investigation in cases of persons having the custody of public money, for the safekeeping of which another person has given bonds.

    Department: The Illinois Department of Revenue. 
    Gross charge: The amount paid for the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in the city and for all services and equipment provided in connection therewith by a retailer, valued in money whether paid in money or otherwise, including cash, credits, services and property of every kind or nature, and shall be determined without any deduction on account of the cost of such telecommunications, the cost of the materials used, labor or service costs or any other expense whatsoever. In case credit is extended, the amount thereof shall be included only as and when paid. Gross charges for private line service shall include charges imposed at each channel termination point within a municipality that has imposed a tax under this article and, charges for the portion of the inter-office channels provided within that municipality. Charges for that portion of the inter-office channel connecting two (2) or more channel termination points, one or more of which is located within the jurisdictional boundary of such municipality, shall be determined by the retailer by multiplying an amount equal to the total charge for the inter-office channel by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of channel termination points that are located within the jurisdictional boundary of the municipality and the denominator of which is the total number of channel termination points connected by the inter-office channel. However, "gross charge" shall not include any of the following:

(2)  Charges for a sent collect telecommunication received outside of such municipality.

(6)  Charges for telecommunications and all services and equipment provided in connection therewith between a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries when the tax imposed under this act has already been paid to a retailer and only to the extent that the charges between the parent corporation and wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries represent expense allocation between the corporations and not the generation of profit for the corporation rendering such service. 
(7)  Bad debts (defined as any portion of a debt that is related to a sale at retail for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible or excludable that has become worthless or uncollectible, as determined under applicable federal income tax standards; if the portion of the debt deemed to be bad is subsequently paid, the retailer shall report and pay the tax on that portion during the reporting period in which the payment is made). 
(8)  Charges paid by inserting coins in coin operated telecommunication devices. 
(9)  Amounts paid by telecommunications retailers under the Telecommunications Infrastructure Maintenance Fee Act.

If the nontaxable charges cannot reasonably be identified, the gross charge from the sale of both taxable and nontaxable services or telecommunications billed on a combined basis shall be attributed to the taxable services or telecommunications. The burden or proving nontaxable charges shall be on the retailer of the telecommunications. 
    Interstate telecommunications: All telecommunications that either originate or terminate outside this state. 
    Intrastate telecommunications: All telecommunications that originate and terminate within this state.

    Purchase at retail: The acquisition, consumption or use of telecommunications through a sale at retail. 
    Retailer: Includes every person engaged in the business of making sales at retail as defined in this section. The department may, in its discretion, upon application, authorize the collection of the tax hereby imposed by any retailer not maintaining a place of business within this state, who, to the satisfaction of the department, furnishes adequate security to ensure collection and payment of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued, without charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be the duty of such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges for telecommunications in this state in the same manner and subject to the same requirements as a retailer maintaining a place of business within this state. The permit may be revoked by the department at its discretion. 
    Retailer maintaining a place of business in this state: Includes any retailer having or maintaining within this state, directly or by a subsidiary, an office, distribution facilities, transmission facilities, sales office, warehouse or other place of business, or any agent or other representative operating within this state under the authority of the retailer or its subsidiary, irrespective of whether such place of business or agent or other representative is located here permanently or temporarily, or whether such retailer or subsidiary is licensed to do business in this state.

For air to ground systems and the like, service address shall be the location of a taxpayer's primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number, authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent. 
    Taxpayer: A person who individually or through his or her agents, employees, or permittees engages in the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in a municipality and who incurs a tax liability as authorized by this chapter.

As used in this article, "private line" means a dedicated nontraffic sensitive service for a single customer, that entitles the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other specified locations. The definition of "telecommunications" shall not include value added services in which computer processing applications are used to act on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other than transmission. "Telecommunications" shall not include purchases of telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end-to-end communications. Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of inter-company facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end-to-end telecommunications service shall be non-taxable as sales for resale. Prepaid telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications" subject to the tax imposed under this article. For purposes of this section, "prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in section 2-27 of the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act.

Sec. 19-2. - Simplified municipal tax imposed. 
    A tax is hereby imposed upon any and all the following acts or privileges: 
(1)  The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving in the municipality intrastate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six (6) percent of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail from a retailer. To prevent actual multi-municipal taxation of the act or privilege that is subject to taxation under this subsection, any taxpayer, upon proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another municipality on that event, shall be allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this section to the extent of the amount of the tax properly due and paid in the municipality that was not previously allowed as a credit against any other municipal tax. 
(2)  The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving in the municipality interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six (6) percent of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail from a retailer. To prevent actual multi-state or multi-municipal taxation of the act or privilege that is subject to taxation under this subsection, any taxpayer, upon proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another state or municipality in this state on such event, shall be allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this section to the extent of the amount of such tax properly due and paid in such other state or such tax properly due and paid in a municipality in this state which was not previously allowed as a credit against any other state or local tax in this state.

Any tax required to be collected pursuant to or as authorized by this chapter and any such tax collected by such retailer and required to be remitted to the department shall constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this chapter shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the department in the manner provided by the department. 
(b)  Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this chapter shall, when collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross charge for telecommunications. 
(Ord. No. O09-30, §§ 1, 3, 5-12-09)

Sec. 19-5. - Resellers. 
(a)  If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will show the department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by this chapter on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional information as the department may reasonably require. 
(b)  Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation, or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax free when such actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the person having discontinued the making of resales. 
(c)  Except as provided in this section, the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made tax free on the grounds of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active resale number from the department and furnishes that number to the retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is nontaxable because of being a sale for resale. 
(Ord. No. O09-30, §§ 1, 3, 5-12-09) 
Sec. 19-6. - Maintaining books and records. 
    Every retailer maintaining a place of business in this state, every retailer authorized or required to collect the tax imposed by this article and every taxpayer shall keep accurate books and records of its business or activity, including original source documents and books of entry denoting the transactions that gave rise, or may have given rise, to any tax liability or exemption.

(d)  If requested by the grantee, or if the city is not satisfied that sufficient corrective action is being actively and diligently pursued by the grantee to remedy the breach or violation, the city shall schedule a public hearing to hear and determine the issues and to consider whether sufficient cause exists to revoke the franchise. The city shall give the grantee not less than fourteen (14) days' written notice specifying the city's intent to consider the revocation of the grantee's franchise, and the date, time and place of the public hearing to be held before the city council or a hearing officer appointed by the city council.

Failure by a grantee to comply with a timetable for corrective action as required by the city council pursuant to the requirements of this section shall be considered to be a breach of this article and may result in a cause for revocation of the franchise. 
(i)  The city council may, upon good cause shown, and upon its own motion, impose any lesser sanction permitted by this article, a franchise agreement, or as such lesser sanction is permitted at law or in equity.

Sec. 19-41. - Availability of access facilities. 
(a)  Use of facilities for public, educational and governmental access upon any CATV system, cable system and video system shall be made available as provided by law, under the conditions and in the manner provided and required hereinbelow, in connection with the production of that public, educational and governmental access programming cablecast upon the system. Where a grantee controls and operates an access channel or channels, the grantee shall establish reasonable rules and procedures designed to promote the utilization of the access programming channel that it controls and operates. Where the city or a school controls and operates an access channel or channels, the city or school shall establish reasonable rules and procedures designed to promote the utilization of the access programming and channel or channels. Subject to the approval of the city, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, the grantee shall accept and cablecast such public, educational and governmental access programming upon the system as shall be provided to the grantee by all PEG users and entities. The grantee shall allow all PEG users and entities desiring to cablecast public, educational and/or governmental access programming to produce such programming upon and electronically interface directly with the cable system of grantee so as to effectively cablecast the public, educational or governmental access programming. 
(b)  Unless otherwise provided in a franchise agreement, grantee shall dedicate an amount of channel space on its system at a minimum level of one (1) channel for public access programming, one (1) channel for educational access programming, and one (1) channel for governmental access. Grantee shall, where possible, cluster access programming channels together.

Any sale, transfer, or assignment not made according to the procedures set forth in this article shall render the franchise agreement void. The sale, transfer, or assignment in bulk of the major part of the tangible assets of a grantee shall be considered an assignment and shall be subject to the provisions of this section. 
(b)  In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the city will not approve any such transfer of control or ownership prior to substantial completion of construction or reconstruction of the CATV system. Notwithstanding the foregoing a grantee may transfer ownership or control of the franchise or the CATV system, after notice to the city, to an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with grantee, where such transfer does not result in a change in the management, operator or ultimate controlling entity of the franchise or the system without any release of the liability of the grantee. The recipient of a transferred franchise for said CATV system shall not be subject to the requirements for new franchises, nor shall the recipient be considered a new franchise for any other purpose provided by law, provided that the transferee agrees in writing to abide by all of the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement with the transferor. In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be approved without the successor(s) in interest to the franchise agreement agreeing in writing to comply with the terms, obligations, and conditions of the franchise agreement for the remainder of the franchise term. The grantee, as transferor, shall promptly cure any present or ongoing franchise violations or defaults prior to the city's granting of consent for the transfer of control or ownership of the franchise. 
(c)  Whenever any transfer subject to city approval under subsection (a) hereof is proposed, a grantee and any proposed assignee or transferee of the franchise shall submit an FCC Form 394, or its successor, containing or accompanied by such information as is required in accordance with applicable law and FCC regulations. In addition, the grantee and/or the transferee shall provide any and all information and documentation of the legal, financial, technical, and character qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party to operate and maintain the CATV system. Such information may include that required by subsection 19-23(a)(1) hereinabove. The grantee and the prospective transferee or controlling party shall provide all other reasonable information as allowed under applicable law requested by the city in connection with such inquiry within the timeframes established by the FCC, and that addresses the effect of the proposed transfer or assignment upon the public. 
(d)  Prior approval of the city shall be required where ownership or control of more than twenty-five (25) percent of the right of control of a grantee acquired, is transferred or during the term of the franchise in any transaction or series of transactions by a person or group of persons acting individually or collectively, on the effective date of the franchise agreement. The word control as used herein is not limited to major stockholders but also includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. By its acceptance of the franchise agreement, a grantee specifically acknowledges and agrees that any such acquisition occurring without a prior approval of the city shall render the franchise void. 
(e)  Subject to any limitations set forth in the franchise agreement, any transfer of the grantee's CATV system, or any part thereof, subject to the city's right of approval pursuant to subsection (a) hereof shall also be subject to the city's right to elect to acquire the grantee's CATV system, or the part thereof proposed to be transferred, for the consideration specified in a bona fide purchase offer based upon valuations from a qualified firm specializing in CATV system appraisals acceptable to the grantee. The city shall exercise this right by written notice to a grantee within thirty (30) days following its receipt of the notice required in subsection (c) hereof. Except for the consideration, the city shall be obligated in exercising this right to accept all other terms of the proposed transfer. The city's rights hereunder shall in no way affect its independent rights under any other provision of this article or under the franchise agreement. 
(f)  Whenever any transfer subject to city approval under subsection (a) hereof is proposed, the grantee shall file an FCC Form 394 at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the proposed date of transfer. The grantee shall provide the city with any additional information requested pursuant to subsection (b) above within thirty (30) days of the written request of the city. 
(g)  As prescribed by the Cable Act (47 U.S.C. 537), the city shall be deemed to have consented to a proposed transfer if the city fails to render a final decision on the request for approval of the proposed transfer within one hundred twenty (120) days following the city's receipt of the written application together with all technical, legal, and financial information and all other reasonable information requested by the city as to the effect of the proposed transfer or assignment upon the public, unless the city and the applicant agree in writing to extend the time for the city to review the application and to grant or deny its consent. The consent of the city shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
(h)  Any transfer approved by the city shall be made by a bill of sale or similar document evidencing closing of the transaction, an executed copy of which shall be filed with the city within sixty (60) days after any such transfer. No such transfer shall be approved unless the proposed transferee shall have agreed in writing to comply with all the provisions of this article now in effect or as amended, as well as the applicable franchise agreement and is found by the city to be, in all respects, legally, technically and financially qualified and possess the operating experience reasonably deemed necessary by the city in order to hold a CATV system franchise. Furthermore, no such approval shall be granted until all defaults are cured or a plan to cure has been approved by the city, and unless all monies accruing to the city as of the date of transfer, whether by way of fees, penalties, damages or otherwise, have first been paid in full or is guaranteed to be paid out of the consideration received by the transferor for such transfer. 
(i)  Any sale, transfer, assignment, mortgage, pledge, lease, sublease or other encumbrance of whatever kind or nature made in violation of the provisions of this section shall be void. 
(j)  The transferee shall reimburse city for any incidental administrative expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, and fees for consulting or other assistance provided on behalf of city that has been expended under this section. 
(k)  The consent or approval of the city to any transfer of the grantee, franchise, or other control thereof, shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the city in and to the use of public streets and public rights-of-way, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subordinate to the terms and conditions of the franchise being transferred.

Sec. 19-43. - Procedure-remedying material franchise violations. 
(a)  In the event that city determines that grantee has violated any material provision of the franchise, city may make a written demand on grantee to remedy such violation. If the violation is not remedied, or in the process of being remedied to the satisfaction of city, within thirty (30) days following any such demand, city shall determine whether or not such violation by grantee was excusable or inexcusable as follows: 
(1)  The city shall conduct an administrative hearing to review the alleged violation, and grantee shall be provided with an opportunity to be heard upon thirty (30) days' written notice to grantee of the time and the place of the hearing; the allegations of franchise violations; and the remedy sought by the city. 
(2)  If, after notice is given and a hearing is held, city determines that such violation by grantee was excusable, city shall direct grantee to correct or remedy the same within such additional time, in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as city may reasonably direct. If city determines that such violation was inexcusable under a like analysis, then it may impose a fine, penalty or other sanction in accordance with this article or take any other action allowed in law or equity to a municipality for addressing a violation of municipal ordinances. 
(3)  A hearing reviewing the administrative findings may be conducted by a hearing office appointed by the city council on the appeal of either the city or the grantee. Such hearing officer shall be an attorney licensed to practice under the laws of the State of Illinois.

(5)  In any hearing conducted by a hearing officer, the officer shall, upon conclusion of the hearing, prepare a recommended decision which includes findings of fact and conclusions. The recommended decision shall be filed with the city clerk and mailed to the parties not later than thirty (30) calendar days after the conclusion of the hearing. Upon receipt of such a recommended decision, the city council may, without holding a further hearing, either: 
a.  Adopt the recommended decision, including findings of fact and conclusion submitted by the hearing officer; 
b.  Adopt the findings of fact and conclusions contained in the recommended decision, modify the decision, and adopt the recommended decision as so revised; 
c.  Based upon the record of, the hearing, modify the findings of fact, conclusions or decisions, and adopt the recommended decision as so revised; or 
d.  Reject the recommended decision and order that a new hearing be held. 
(6)  If the city council determines there are grounds for termination of the franchise and that the franchise should be terminated, the city council may adopt a resolution which terminates the franchise and includes the decision. The effective date of termination shall be such date as is prescribed by the city council, within its sole discretion, in the resolution. 
(7)  In the event that the city council determines that a remedy other than termination is warranted, the city may impose a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day per occurrence from the date upon which the violation or violations were to have been cured. 
All fines levied are to be paid within thirty (30) days and if not, such non-payment after thirty (30) days could constitute an additional breach or cause for revocation of the franchise. 
(8)  If the city council adopts a resolution under this section which terminates the franchise, grantee shall have all further legal remedies available to it by law.

Neither the existence of other remedies identified in this article nor the exercise thereof shall be deemed to bar or otherwise limit the right of the city to recover, monetary damages (except where liquidated damages are otherwise prescribed) for such violation by the grantee, or judicial enforcement of the grantee's obligations by means of specific performance, injunction relief or mandate, or any other judicial remedy available at law or in equity. 
(Ord. No. O07-134, § 1, 11-27-07)

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. O17-081, Exh. A, adopted November 14, 2017, amended Article III, §§ 19-65-19-80, as herein setout. The former Article III pertained to similar subject matter. 

Sec. 19-65. - Purpose. 
(a)  The purpose of this article is to establish regulations for the facilities and equipment involved in all modes of communication, and intended to regulate all such communication as it now exists and in the future, including for example communication and wireless data transfer services, as well as their accompanying facilities, including but not limited to antennas, dishes, poles, equipment and towers. The goals of this article are: 
(1)  To protect residential and riverfront areas and land uses by minimizing adverse impacts of towers, antennas, dishes, poles and communications and data transfer facilities; 
(2)  To encourage the location of all such facilities in non-residential and non-riverfront areas and to ensure that they are located in areas that minimize adverse impacts; 
(3)  To enhance the ability to provide all such modes of communication services to the community quickly, effectively and efficiently; 
(4)  To promote, encourage and require, as appropriate, the shared use/collocation of such facilities as a primary option, rather than construction of additional single-use structures and to encourage the attachment of antennas, dishes and equipment to existing structures; 
(5)  To promote and encourage utilization of technological designs that will either eliminate or reduce the need for erection of new structures to support such communication facilities; 
(6)  To ensure such facilities are configured in a way that minimizes adverse visual impacts by careful design, appropriate siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques; 
(7)  To avoid potential damage to property caused by such facilities by insuring such structures, facilities and equipment are soundly and carefully designed, constructed, modified, maintained and removed when no longer used or are determined to be structurally unsound; 
(8)  To ensure that all such facilities are compatible with surrounding land uses; and 
(9)  To ensure that said communications facilities do not compromise public safety communications. 
(b)  In furtherance of these goals, the city shall give due consideration to its comprehensive plan, zoning map, existing land uses and environmentally sensitive areas in approving sites for the location of these facilities.

For a new tower, or pole with antenna(s) the applicant shall demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the zoning administrator, FoxWalk Overlay District Design Review Committee, the planning commission, or city council, as the case may be, that no existing tower, pole, structure or alternative technology which does not require the use of towers or additional structures can accommodate the applicant's proposed pole or antenna. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower, pole, structure or alternative technology which does not require the use of towers or structures can accommodate the applicant's proposed pole or antenna may consist of any of the following: 
(1)  No existing towers, poles or structures are located within the geographic area which meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
(2)  Existing towers, poles or structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering requirements and cannot be enlarged sufficiently to meet their needs. 
(3)  Existing towers, poles or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment. 
(4)  The applicant's proposed pole or antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with antenna on existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
(5)  The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing tower, pole or structure or to adapt an existing tower, pole or structure for sharing are unreasonable. 
(6)  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing towers, pole and structures unsuitable. 
(7)  The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that does not require the use of towers, pole or structures, such as a microcell network using multiple low-powered transmitters/receivers attached to a wireline system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new tower or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology unsuitable.

Where a ground-mounted facility is allowed, such equipment shall be screened around the perimeter in accordance with a landscape plan sealed by a professional landscape engineer. Plant materials shall consist of approved plantings and layouts as determined by the director of land use and zoning or their designee. The owner or wireless provider shall be responsible for maintenance of all landscaping as provided in the approved landscape plan. 
4.  Future undergrounding. The city may, from time to time, make a decision to eliminate above-ground utility poles of a particular type generally, such as electric utility poles, in all or a significant portion of the city. In the event that such a utility pole has a collocated small wireless facility in place at the time of such a decision, the city shall either: 
a.  Continue to maintain the utility pole, or install and maintain a reasonable utility pole or wireless support structure for the collocation of the small wireless facility; or 
b.  Offer to sell the utility pole to the wireless provider at a reasonable cost, or allow the wireless provider to install its own utility pole so it can maintain service from that location. 
(f)  Collocation limits. Wireless providers shall not collocate small wireless facilities on city utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the pole or the electric supply zone of the pole. 
    However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may be located in the communications space on the city utility pole and on the top of the pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the pole. 
    For purposes of this subsection, the terms "communications space", "communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. 
(g)  Code compliance. Wireless providers shall comply with applicable codes and local code provisions or regulations that concern public safety. 
(h)  In the event city, in its reasonable discretion, deems it necessary to remove, relocate or replace a utility pole or wireless support structure, the city shall notify wireless provider at least one hundred eighty (180) days prior of the need to remove or relocate its small wireless facility. In such event, the city shall provide options for alternative locations for the wireless provider's relocation of equipment which shall be in a mutually agreeable location ("Alternative Premises"). The wireless provider shall be solely responsible for all costs related to the relocation of its small wireless facility to the alternative premises. In the event that a suitable alternative premises cannot be identified, the wireless provider may terminate the applicable permit. In the event of an emergency, the city must provide as much notice as reasonably practical under the circumstances.

Sec. 21-19. - Abatement procedure. 
    An abatement action under this section is a remedy cumulative to other remedies at law and equity. Injunctive relief may be sought to prevent or restrain violations of this article. An abatement action in no way preempts, supercedes or bars civil or criminal prosecution for violation of this article or any other applicable building, fire prevention or public safety regulation. The commencement of an abatement action is not a condition precedent to the initiation of criminal prosecution or any other remedy. Failure to adhere to the procedure prescribed in this section shall not bar relief or remedy if such failure causes no prejudice and merely constitutes harmless error. 
    The following shall be the procedure for the abatement of a nuisance within the jurisdiction of the city: 
(1)  Notice shall be given to the owner of the nuisance or the owner of the property on which the nuisance exists. For purposes of this section, the person to whom the last general tax bill on the property was sent shall be presumed to be the owner. Notice by regular mail and posting of notice on the front entrance to the structure or similar location shall be deemed sufficient, legal notice to the owner and all other responsible parties. If there is no structure on the property, a sign may be posted anywhere on the premises. 
(2)  The notice shall state the location and nature of the nuisance. It shall inform the owner that if the nuisance is not abated within a specified number of days, the city will, at the expense of such owner, have such nuisance abated. Fourteen (14) days shall be such specified number unless otherwise stated in the City Code, or the public health and safety require a shorter abatement period. The obligations of the owner are continuing obligations which are effective for one (1) year from the date of the notice, which date shall be the date the notice was mailed or the date the notice was posted, whichever comes last. 
(3)  If upon the giving of notice, the owner fails to abate the nuisance within the time and in the manner specified in the notice, the city may cause the nuisance to be abated, as it deems appropriate. The cost of the abatement shall be assessed against the land upon which the nuisance is located. 
(4)  If the nuisance is of such threat to the welfare and safety of the community that it must be abated immediately, the mayor or his designee, in his or her sole discretion, is authorized to take such steps as may be necessary to effect the abatement regardless of the requirements of this article. 
(5)  All fees, costs or charges assessed or incurred by the city shall be a lien upon the real property. The lien shall be superior to all subsequent liens and encumbrances. The city shall file a notice of lien within two (2) years after such cost and expense is incurred, which notice of lien shall be filed in the office of the appropriate county recorder of deeds, and 
a.  Upon payment of the cost and expense by the owner or responsible party after notice of lien has been filed, the city shall release the lien. 
b.  The lien may be enforced by proceedings to foreclose as in the case of mortgages or mechanics liens. 
(Ord. No. O06-127, § 1, 12-12-06) 
Sec. 21-20. - Nuisance originating outside the city jurisdiction. 
    Upon a reasonable showing that a nuisance from a source outside the city jurisdiction is causing prejudice to a resident or residents of the city, the mayor or his designee shall have the authority to pursue all avenues, including the institution of court proceedings to effect the abatement of such nuisance. 
(Ord. No. O06-127, § 1, 12-12-06) 
Sec. 21-21. - Nuisance fee. 
    Any person found maintaining a nuisance as set forth in this article II and who fails to abate it within thirty (30) days or such shorter time period contained in any notice to abate, shall be absolutely liable to the city for a daily nuisance fee in the amount set forth in section 1-11 of the Aurora City Code. This nuisance fee shall be in addition to any fines or costs recoverable pursuant to this article or any other Code provision.

Such reductions may be granted upon the written motion of a person who has, pursuant to Section 39.2(b) of the Act, filed a notice of intent to submit an application for location approval, which notice has also advised the recipients of the applicant's intention to move for a copies reduction under this section. Such reductions motion must be filed with the clerk at least five (5) calendar days prior to a regularly scheduled city council meeting. The moving party must submit a certified copy of the notice of intent, and demonstrate that: compliance with the copies requirement of subsection (1) above will be inordinately expensive, without commensurate benefit to the city and the public; and that the proposed copies reduction will not work any fundamental unfairness on the city or the public, in their ability to review, and prepare for the hearing on the location approval application. The city council shall act upon the motion expeditiously and may act upon the request for copies reduction at its first regular meeting after filing of the motion. 
(3)  In addition to the foregoing, the applicant shall deposit with the city clerk at the time of filing the application for site approval of a new PCF a filing fee deposit in the form of a certified or cashier's check of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00), except that a filing fee deposit of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000.00) is required if said proposed facility is designed as a hazardous waste disposal site or if the disposal or volume reduction of any waste will be by incineration or burning. If the applicant elects to file an amended application for site location approval for any PCF in accordance with this article, such filing shall be accompanied by payment of a supplemental fee of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00). 
The applicable filing fee is intended to defray the reasonable and necessary costs of processing the application, including, but not limited to: costs of site inspection, clerical expenses, copying costs, space rental, hearing officer compensation, court reporter expenses, transcription costs, public notice expenses, staff review time, if any, city attorney and city consultants (such as qualified professional engineers, planners, appraisers, environmental counsel, etc.) (including tests, exhibits, and testimony, if any, provided by said consultants), and other relevant costs incident to the consideration of an application, the costs incident to preparing the record for appeal, and the cost of representing the city on appeal in case of an appeal of a city council decision (the "city costs"). Should the city incur any additional costs in access of the applicable filing fee deposit, the applicant shall bear any and all such additional costs and shall promptly pay over such additional amount to the city upon request or demand. If at any time the funds deposited by the applicant are reduced below fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), the applicant shall deposit an additional fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00). 
If there are funds remaining in the filing fee deposit after payment of the city costs, such amount shall be refunded to the applicant upon the final resolution of the application process (including appeals to the Illinois Pollution Control Board, appellate court, Illinois Supreme Court, federal courts, and administrative review in the courts, if any). 
The application must be complete, with answers provided for each question on the application form. The application must contain consecutively numbered pages and it must be accompanied by all site plans, exhibits, maps and documents required by this article and by the rules and procedures. The date that the applicant files a complete application in proper form, together with the applicable filing fee deposit, with the city clerk shall be considered the official filing date for all time limit purposes. The application is not effective unless the application is in strict compliance with this article, the rules and procedures and with the Act. If upon review of the application within twenty-one (21) days of its submittal it is determined by the city to be incomplete and not in strict conformance with the aforesaid, the application is deemed not filed and the filing fee (less city costs and expenses) shall be returned to the applicant. Failure of the city to reject a request for site approval is not, and shall not be deemed, acceptance of the form or substance of the request, and the applicant remains solely responsible to demonstrate that the location approval criteria are all met. At any time prior to completion by the applicant of the presentation of the applicant's factual evidence and an opportunity for cross-questioning by the hearing officer, city representatives and any participants, the applicant may file not more than one amended application upon payment of additional fees pursuant to Section 39.2(k) of the Act and this subsection. Provided, however, that the time limitation for final action set forth in Section 39.2(e) of the Act and subsection 21-46(b) shall be extended for an additional period of ninety (90) days. 
(4)  In the event a host agreement has been entered into between the city and the applicant, fees and costs will be paid in accordance with the host agreement in lieu of subsection (3) above. If, prior to making a final local siting decision, the city has negotiated and entered into a host agreement with the applicant, the terms and conditions of the host agreement, whether written or oral, shall be disclosed and made a part of the hearing record for that local siting proceeding. In the case of an oral agreement, the disclosure shall be made in the form of a written summary jointly prepared and submitted by the city and the applicant and shall describe the terms and conditions of the oral agreement. 
(b)  (1)  Upon receipt of a proper and complete application, and payment of the applicable filing fee deposit, the city clerk shall date stamp all the copies and immediately deliver one (1) copy to the chairman or county executive of the county board, one (1) copy to the county solid waste director, one (1) copy to each member of the Aurora City Council, one (1) copy to the clerk of each municipality entitled to notice of the public hearings pursuant to subsection 21-45(b), one (1) copy to the head of each City of Aurora Department or Office as follows: (1) city corporation counsel's office; (2) department of planning and zoning; (3) public works department; (4) street department; (5) department of engineering; (6) building department; (7) fire department; (8) police department; and three (3) copies to the hearing officer selected by the mayor and city council. The city's corporation counsel shall be responsible for coordinating review of the request for site approval by the aforementioned departments and is authorized to call interdepartment meetings for the purpose of defining those reports and studies that are desired and for setting deadlines for the submittal of reports and recommendations. 
(2)  The corporation counsel for the city may retain consultants on behalf of the city to develop a record sufficient to form the basis of an appeal of the city council's decision. The consultants and the city departments shall then commence a study of the application. The applicant shall cooperate fully with the consultants and the technical staff of the city in their review of the application, including providing access to the site for study or testing, including but not limited to geophysical testing. 
(c)  A copy of the application and all related documents or other materials on file with the city council shall be made available for public inspection in the office of the city clerk during normal business hours. Members of the public shall be allowed to obtain a copy of said application or any part thereof upon payment of the actual cost of reproduction as outlined in the Illinois Freedom of Information Act (5 ILCS 140/1, et seq.) 
(d)  It is the applicant's duty to comply with all notice requirements set forth in the Act. The applicant shall: 
(1)  No later than fourteen (14) days prior to filing an application for site location approval with the city clerk, cause written notice of such application to be served either in person or by registered mail, return receipt requested, on the owners of all property within the subject area not solely owned by the applicant, and on the owners of all property within two hundred fifty (250) feet in each direction of the lot line of the subject property, said owners being such persons or entities which appear from the authentic tax records of the county in which the facility is to be located; provided, that the number of all feet occupied by public roads, streets, alleys and other public ways shall be excluded in computing the two hundred fifty (250) feet requirement; provided further, that in no event shall this requirement exceed four hundred (400) feet, including public streets, alleys and other public ways. 
(2)  The applicant shall serve such written notice upon each member of the general assembly from the legislative district in which the proposed facility is to be located, and this notice shall also be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the site is located. 
(3)  The applicant shall state in such notice the name and address of the applicant, the location of the proposed site, the nature and size of the development, the nature of the activity proposed, the probable life of the proposed activity, the date when the request for site approval will be submitted to the city clerk, a description of the right of persons to comment on such request as hereafter provided, and any other information as may be required by the rules and procedures and the Act.

Sec. 22-26. - Complaint process. 
(a)  Any person may file a complaint alleging a violation of this chapter with the human relations commission if the alleged violation occurred within the City of Aurora. 
(b)  The human relations commission, in accordance with its bylaws and rules of procedure, shall conduct investigations regarding all complaints filed with the human relations commission and hold any hearings necessary to facilitate said investigations and to aid human relations commission members in determining whether or not there has been a violation of this chapter. 
(c)  The following parameters shall govern the filing of complaints with the human relations commission: 
(1)  A complaint under this chapter must be filed with the human relations commission within one hundred and eighty (180) days from the date of the alleged occurrence of the alleged violation. If the alleged violation is of a continuing nature, the date of occurrence may be any date subsequent to the commencement of the violation, up to and including the date on which it may have ceased. 
a.  In order to preserve rights under the Illinois Human Rights Act ("Human Rights Act"), 775 ILCS 5/1-101, et seq., a contemporaneous complaint must also be filed with the Illinois Department of Human Rights ("IDHR") within one hundred and eighty (180) days from the date of the alleged occurrence of the alleged violation. 
b.  Any investigation on the part of IDHR will be independent of the Human Relations Commission's investigation and will be governed by the statutory provisions of the Human Rights Act and applicable regulations. 
(2)  A complaint will be deemed filed with the human relations commission when it has been filed with the chairperson of the human relations commission or an employee of the city designated by the chairperson to receive complaints; in person, in writing and signed by the complainant. The human relations commission may waive any of these requirements upon a showing of extraordinary circumstances. Each complaint, once filed, shall be docketed and assigned a case number by the chairperson or an employee of the city designated by the chairperson to receive complaints. 
(3)  A complaint shall be in such detail as to substantially apprise any party of the date, place and facts with respect to the alleged violation. It must contain the following: (a) the name and address of the complainant; (b) the name, address and telephone number (if known) of the respondent; and (c) a statement of the facts alleged to constitute the chapter violation, including the date(s), location(s) thereof, and basis of discrimination. 
(4)  The filing of a complaint or the failure to file a complaint with the human relations commission does not bar any person from seeking any other remedy that may be provided by law. 
(d)  The human relations commission shall serve upon the respondent a copy of any complaint (original or amended) filed against said respondent and a copy of this chapter within ten (10) days of filing thereof. 
(e)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, once a complaint has been served on a respondent, the respondent shall preserve all records and other material which may be relevant to the case until the matter has been closed. 
(f)  If a majority of the human relations commission determines after such investigation that probable cause exists for the allegations made in the complaint, the human relations commission shall set a date for a conciliation conference. Such conciliation conference shall be informal and no record of the proceedings shall be kept. At such conference, the human relations commission or any member thereof shall interview the complainant and the person against whom the complaint has been directed and shall attempt to resolve the complaint by all proper methods of conciliation and persuasion. If such attempts at conciliation are not successful within thirty (30) days after the date of filing of the complaint, the human relations commission shall then proceed promptly with a full hearing of the complaint. 
(g)  The following parameters shall govern the amendment of any complaint filed with the human relations commission: 
(1)  A complaint, or any part thereof, may be amended as a matter of right to cure technical defects or omissions at any time. 
(2)  A complaint, or any part thereof, may be amended by the complainant as matter of right to clarify or amplify allegations made therein, due to a change of circumstances, or to set forth additional facts or allegations related to the matter of the original charge, at any time before a public hearing and such amendment shall relate back to the original filing date. The amended complaint shall be in writing, shall be in the same form and shall follow the same content requirements as specified in this section, paragraphs (3)(a), (b), (c) with respect to the original complaint, unless impracticable. 
(3)  When facts not raised by the pleadings are heard at a conference or hearing by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings. Such amendment of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause them to conform to the evidence and to raise these issues may be made upon motion of any party at any time, but in any event before a final decision is reached; failure to so amend shall not affect the result of the hearing of these issues. If evidence or an amendment is objected to at a hearing on the grounds that it is not within the issues made by the pleadings, the sitting panel may allow the pleadings to be amended and shall do so freely when the presentation of the merits of the action will be served thereby and the objecting party fails to satisfy the siting panel that the admission of such evidence would prejudice the party in maintaining the party's action or defense upon the merits. The chairperson of the human relations commission may grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to respond to such evidence. 
(h)  A complaint or any part thereof may be unilaterally withdrawn by the complainant at any time prior to a determination of the human relations commission that there is probable cause to believe that the allegations made in the complaint state a violation of this chapter, or prior to the human relations commission's dismissal of the complaint. A complainant's request to withdraw a complaint shall be in writing and shall be signed by the complainant. The human relations commission shall approve the request if it is knowingly and voluntarily made, and shall promptly notify all parties in writing of the withdrawal. 
(i)  Each respondent shall file a short written answer and any defenses within fourteen (14) days of receipt of the complaint. The respondent shall file the answer with the human relations commission and shall serve it upon the complainant. The answer shall not exceed five (5) typewritten pages unless the human relations commission expressly grants permission otherwise. The response shall contain the full name, address and telephone number of respondent and the name, address and telephone number of respondent's attorney if respondent is represented by counsel. The response should contain specific information that directly addresses the allegations contained in the complaint. If no response is filed within the fourteen (14) days, it is presumed that the complaint is not denied and such failure to respond will not delay processing of the complaint. 
(j)  Every party has the responsibility to promptly provide the human relations commission with notice of any change in address or any prolonged absence from that current address where he or she can be located when necessary at any time while the case is pending before the human relations commission. In addition, each party is responsible for providing the human relations commission with necessary information and to be available for interviews and conferences upon reasonable notice or request by the human relations commission. If a complainant cannot be located or does not adequately respond to reasonable requests by the human relations commission, the human relations commission may dismiss the complaint. The human relations commission shall promptly serve upon the parties written notice of the dismissal. The notice shall be addressed to the complainant at the last known address, and shall advise that the complainant may obtain review of the matter by the human relations commission by filing a motion to reconsider. If a respondent does not adequately respond to reasonable requests by the human relations commission, the human relations commission may consider the lack of response as an admission of guilt by the respondent. 
(k)  The human relations commission may subpoena witnesses and documents as permitted by law, union contract and/or personnel/disciplinary regulations, in order to facilitate any such investigation and/or hearing, provided, however, that subpoenas shall only be issued to persons or for documents which have a substantial evidentiary connection with a written complaint sworn to before the human relations commission, where the opposing parties cannot or will not agree to provide such information voluntarily. In regard to complaints against city employees, the issuance of a subpoena shall be further contingent upon the human relations commission's determination that any internal review procedure of a prospective subpoena recipient has concluded, and upon the human relations commission's consideration of the results thereof, that the subpoena issuance is still required in order to facilitate the proceedings pending before the human relations commission. 
(l)  All members of the human relations commission shall maintain the highest level of confidentiality with regard to any and all information received in connection with their work hereunder, and in connection with any and all reports, results of investigations and recommendations it shall issue, and shall sign a confidentiality agreement to that end. 
(m)  The human relations commission may issue such publications and results of investigations and hearings, subject to legal and confidentiality limitations, and may make such recommendations to complainants, accused persons and the mayor and city council as in its judgment will effectuate the policy of this chapter. Within forty-five (45) days of receipt of such recommendations, every recipient thereof must respond to the human relations commission, including a written statement of the recipient's actions, or refusal to act, in accordance with the recommendations of the human relations commission. 
(Ord. No. O12-043, § 1, 6-12-12) 
Sec. 22-27. - Judicial relief.

(Ord. No. O12-043, § 1, 6-12-12) 
Sec. 22-28. - Penalty.

Chapter 23 - IMPACT AND DEVELOPMENT FEES 
ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Secs. 23-1-23-10. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - LAND/CASH DEDICATION 

Sec. 23-11. - Park and school contribution criteria. 
    Park and school contributions required by section 43-56 of Aurora's Code of Ordinances shall be determined by the following criteria and formula: 
(1)  Criteria for requiring park and recreation land dedication. 
a.  Requirement and population ratio. The ultimate density of a proposed development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required for dedication. The total requirement shall be ten (10.0) acres of land excluding retention and detention facilities, except for land needed for emergency overland routing of water, per one thousand (1,000) of ultimate population in accordance with the following classifications: 
Local Classification Sub-neighborhood/ 
Neighborhood Community Designation Mini Park Community Park Neighborhood Park Neighborhood Park/School Community Park/School Size Range 4 acres minimum to 15 acres 15-200 acres Acres per 1,000 pop. 5.5 4.5 Population Served 800-2,700 3,000+ Service Area Neighborhood: Within 1/2 mile walking distance 15 minutes driving time  
b.  Location. The comprehensive park and recreation plan as adopted by the Fox River Valley Pleasure Driveway and Park District (Southern Kane County Section) shall be used as a guideline in locating sites. A park site adjoining all elementary school sites of not less than five (5) acres of land excluding retention and detention facilities, except land needed for emergency overland routing of water, shall be considered a requirement. A central location which will serve equally the entire development is most desirable. In large developments these sites can be located throughout the development according to established standards for park area distances. 
c.  Credit for private open spaces and recreation areas. When subdividers or developers provide their own open space for recreation areas and facilities, it has the effect of reducing the demand for local public recreational services. Depending on the size of the development a portion of the park and recreation area in subdivisions or planned unit developments may at the option of the city council be provided in the form of private open spaces in lieu of dedicated public open space. The extent of same shall be determined by the city council, based upon the needs of the projected residents and in conformance to the total park and recreation land for the general area. In general, a substitution of private open space for dedicated parks will imply a substantially higher degree of improvement and the installation of recreational facilities, including equipment by the developer as part of his obligation. Detailed plans of such areas, including specifications of facilities to be installed, must be approved by the city; and before any credit is given for private recreation areas, the subdivider or developer must guarantee that these private recreation areas will be permanently maintained for such use by the execution of the appropriate legal documents. Private swimming clubs are included in this provision. When an adjustment for private recreation areas is warranted, it will be necessary to compute the total park land dedication that would have been required from the subdivision or planned unit development and then subtract the credit to be given. 
(2)  Criteria for requiring school site dedication. 
a.  Requirement and population ratio. The ultimate number of students to be generated by a subdivision or planned unit development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required to be dedicated for school sites. The land dedication requirement shall be determined by obtaining the ratio of estimated children to be served in each such school classification over the maximum recommended number of students to be served in each such school classification as stated herein, and then applying such ratio to the minimum recommended number of acres for a school site of each such school classification as stated herein. The product thereof shall be the acres of land deemed needed to have sufficient land for school sites to serve the estimated increased children in each such school classification. 
b.  School classifications and size of school site. School classifications and size of school sites within the city shall be determined in accordance with the following criteria: 
School classification by Maximum number of students for each school classification Minimum number of acres of land for each school site of such classification Elementary schools grades kindergarten through 5 600 11 Junior high schools grades 6 through 8 900 29 High schools, grades 9 through 12 2,300 53  
c.  Location. The comprehensive school plan and/or the standards adopted by the effected school district shall be used as a guideline in locating sites. 
(3)  Criteria for requiring a contribution in lieu of park and school sites. Where the resulting land contribution is too small to be practical or when the available land is inappropriate for park and recreational purpose or a school site, the city shall require the subdivider or developer to pay a cash contribution (pursuant to subsection (5)) in lieu of the land dedication required. The cash contributions in lieu of park and recreation land dedication shall be held in trust by the city, or other public body designated by the city, solely for the acquisition of park and recreation land as hereinbefore classified, which will be available to serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or development or for the improvement of other existing local park and recreation land which already serves such needs. The cash contributions in lieu of school sites shall be held in trust by the city, or other public body designated by the city, solely for use in the acquisition of land for a school site to serve the immediate or future needs of children from that subdivision or development or for the improvement to any existing school site or buildings which already serves such needs. 
(4)  Criteria for requiring dedication and fee. There will be situations in subdivisions or planned unit developments when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both necessary. These occasions will arise when: 
a.  Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the location for a park or school site. That portion of the land within the subdivision falling within the park or school location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated; 
b.  A major part of the local park or recreation site or school site has already been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from the development to complete the site. The remaining portions shall be required by dedication, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required. 
(5)  Cash contribution computation factors. 
a.  Density. The city council shall establish by separate resolution a table of population density generally indicative of current and short-range projected trends in family size for new construction which shall be used in calculating the amount of required dedication of acres of land or the cash contribution in lieu thereof unless a written objection is filed thereto by the subdivider or developer. 
b.  Land value. In such separate resolution, a land value for the purpose of making the calculation of cash contributions required herein shall be based on the present fair market value of land in and surrounding the city. 
c.  Land improvement. The cash contribution shall be based on the land value defined above, adjusted for the cost to improve the land as otherwise specified in this Code for purposes of being dedicated for park and school sites.

Sec. 23-18. - School developmental impact fees. 
(a)  This section is intended to set forth the policy of the city council, that all annexations of territory hereinafter to the city for residential development, for which the owners and/or developers thereof have entered into an annexation agreement in accordance with the Illinois Municipal Code, shall include, among other agreement terms, a contribution in an amount based on the proportionate share of costs of the various public school facilities required to serve the new development. This section shall also apply to property rezoned for residential subdivisions hereafter and developed in territory currently within the city, but which is not subject to or limited by any applicable such annexation. Further, this section shall not apply to territory hereafter annexed that is either: currently subject to an annexation agreement that specifically prohibits such new fees and exactions, or is made up of individual lots or groups of lots undeveloped but not otherwise subject to subdivision control. 
(b)  The amounts listed in Exhibit A* (the "School Developmental Impact Fee Table"), attached hereto and made a part hereof, as limited to seventy-five (75) percent thereof and a maximum fee amount of three thousand five hundred dollars ($3,500.00), and specifically referencing thereafter to any modification thereof developed by and for the school districts in which the proposed development is to occur, are collectively considered by the city council to fairly and equitably represent the applicable proportionate costs of public school facilities, as adopted and/or modified by each such district, after consideration of the additional demand from new residential development, and appropriate consideration for contribution of land, cash in lieu of land, debt service payments, or other taxes dedicated for such public school facilities. All amounts listed in Exhibit A were calculated as a model basis for each of the individual school districts, to be reviewed in accordance with the various documentation and assessments completed on behalf of each said district to analyze the impact of development on such district. In all cases, for the purpose of determining a bedroom under this section, it shall be a room which is a habitable space that may be lawfully furnished with a bed and used for sleeping, but not including a living room, a dining room or a kitchen. However, a den or loft which may lawfully be used as a bedroom shall be considered a bedroom. 
(c)  Upon receipt of school developmental impact fees, the city shall deposit such funds into such city accounts as it shall determine, to be held for the use and benefit of the applicable school district within which collected, in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof. As a condition precedent to delivery of any funds to any school district, it shall execute and deliver to the city an indemnification and hold harmless intergovernmental agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B*; to be approved individually by the city council from time to time. Such agreements shall incorporate such modifications to Exhibit A as shall be applicable thereto. 
(d)  Each respective school district shall also maintain and keep adequate financial records for all funds collected pursuant to this section and all monies disbursed. These records shall show the source and disbursement of all revenues, shall account for all monies received, and shall ensure that the disbursement of such funds shall be certified by the applicable school district to be used solely for the provision of projects specified in its capital improvement program. 
(e)  Each individual school district shall, each year, review the development potential of the school district and its improvement program, and recommend to the city such modifications as are deemed necessary to be adopted by the city, on the advice and consent of the applicable district, as a result of (1) development occurring in the prior year, (2) public school facilities actually constructed, (3) changing facility needs, (4) inflation, (5) revised cost estimates for public school facilities, (6) changes in the availability of other funding sources applicable to public school facility projects, and (7) such other factors as may be relevant to both parties.

b.  Non-individually identifiable articles: 
i.  Articles that cannot be distinguished from any other similar articles may be described in groups of similar types of articles, but only within the same transaction made by the same seller/pawner. Licensees shall provide reasonable descriptions of the number and types of items within each group to enable the Police Department to determine if they may have been stolen during a particular crime. Example: an individual pawner/seller brings in a video game controller, 5 video game discs, and numerous items of jewelry. The licensee would first of all have to individually itemize and photograph the video game controller as outlined in "Individually identifiable articles" above, as it would be a serially-numbered item. As for the remaining items, the licensee shall not list them as "Miscellaneous video games and jewelry." Instead, the licensee shall describe them as follows: "5 video game discs to include the following titles...." and "Miscellaneous jewelry to include 2 yellow gold necklaces, 1 silver necklace, 2 pairs of silver earrings, one women's yellow gold ring, 1 women's white gold diamond ring and two silver bracelets." 
ii.  A digital photograph(s) shall be taken of each group of similar types of articles within each transaction made by the same seller/pawner. The articles may be photographed together as a group, but each individual article shall be visible in the photograph. For example, given the circumstances outlined in subparagraph "a" above, the 5 video game discs would be photographed together as a group side-by-side (not stacked on top of each other), and the jewelry items would be photographed together as a group with each item laid out so as to be individually viewable (not piled together in a heap). 
b.  Sales by licensees. 
1.  In order to facilitate the return of stolen items to their rightful owners, individually identifiable non-junk/scrap articles sold by a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer to an individual shall be reported to LeadsOnline. Licensees shall individually itemize and describe each individually identifiable article so sold. 
2.  Each individually identifiable non-junk/scrap article sold by a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer shall be associated with the person to whom it was sold. The licensee shall record/report the following information for each such transaction: 
a.  The name and current address of the purchaser must be recorded/reported-a photographic image of a government-issued photo ID card is not necessary. 
b.  A digital photograph of non-junk/scrap articles sold by a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer to an individual is not required. 
3.  As there is no lawful basis for confiscating and returning property to the victim of a crime that cannot be individually identified as having been stolen from the victim, reporting the sale of non-individually identifiable articles by a licensee to LeadsOnline is not required. 
(2)  Junk/scrap articles. 
a.  Purchases by licensees. 
1.  Junk/scrap articles may be recorded/reported in bulk, but must specify the weight, type (e.g., steel, copper, aluminum, etc.) and form (e.g. sheet, pipe, wire, etc.) of the bulk material. 
2.  Each different type and form of junk/scrap bulk material brought in to a secondhand dealer by an individual for sale during a transaction shall be associated with the person who brought the material in. Licensees shall record/report the following information for each such transaction: 
a.  The name, current address and date of birth of the pawner/seller. 
b.  A photographic or scanned image of a photo ID card of the seller, sufficiently clear to allow the information on the ID to be read. The photo ID must be a currently valid (not expired) card issued by a government entity of the United States, and must include the pawner/seller's first and last name, current address, date of birth, and physical descriptors. 
c.  If the seller is selling on behalf of a company or business, the name, address, and telephone number of such company or business shall also be recorded/reported. 
d.  If the junk/scrap is brought by motor vehicle to a licensee for sale, the make, model, color, and license plate number of that vehicle shall be recorded/reported. 
e.  The date and time of the transaction. 
f.  A digital photograph or, if the licensee has a video system, video segment of each individual type and form of bulk material purchased by the licensee shall be linked to the record of that transaction. 
b.  Sales by licensees. 
1.  Licensees do not need to record/report any information pertaining to the sale of junk/scrap material. 
2.  Reserved. 
(3)  Coins and paper money. 
a.  Purchases/receipts by licensees. 
1.  Coins have no distinguishing characteristics that separate them from other coins of the same mintage, and although paper money is serial numbered, those serial numbers are so seldom known by their last possessor that paper money is effectively indistinguishable from other paper money of the same denomination. Furthermore, unlike coins made of precious metals, paper money seldom carries any value significantly beyond the face value of the bill, and when stolen is usually used directly as cash and not sold to a currency dealer. Accordingly, coins or paper money brought in by an individual (pawner/seller) for sale, barter, trade, pledge or pawn during a single transaction do not need to be itemized individually, but rather may be recorded/reported in bulk. 
2.  Coins or paper money brought in to a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer by an individual (pawner/seller) for sale, barter, trade, pledge or pawn during a transaction shall be associated with the person (pawner/seller) who brought the article in. The licensee shall record/report the following information for each such transaction: 
a.  The name, current address and date of birth of the pawner/seller. 
b.  A digital photographic or scanned image of a photo ID card of the pawner/seller, sufficiently clear to allow the information on the ID to be read. The photo ID must be a currently valid (not expired) card issued by a government entity of the United States, and must include the pawner/seller's first and last name, current address, date of birth, and physical descriptors. 
c.  The date and time of the transaction. 
d.  The quantities and types of coins or paper money present. If coins are all of the same type, they shall be reported by either quantity or weight, and type (e.g., 5 Morgan silver dollars, 25 buffalo nickels, 5 lbs. of wheat pennies, etc.). If coins are from a collection, a description of the theme of the collection (e.g., Bicentennial coins, state quarters, etc.) along with the number of coins shall be provided. If coins represent an accumulation of disparate coins with no overall theme, a generic description of the type and quantity of coins shall be provided (e.g., approximately 200 U.S. coins of miscellaneous dates and denominations, approximately 100 foreign coins from various countries, etc.). Paper money shall be reported by quantity and type (e.g., 25 U.S. $5 silver certificates, etc.). 
3.  As a photograph of coins or paper money conveys no more information than can be obtained from the written descriptions required by subsection (3)a.2.d. of this section, no photographs of coins or paper money are required. 
b.  Sales by licensees. 
1.  Licensees do not need to record/report any information pertaining to the sale of coins or paper money to other individuals or businesses. 
In the event the electronic reporting system malfunctions or is otherwise not operational, the licensee shall, at all times during such malfunction or non-operation, be required to keep written records of any and all transactions made during the period of malfunction or non-operation, to include all information required by this section. These written records shall be reported/uploaded to LeadsOnline, or the city's current electronic reporting system, as soon as practicable after the electronic reporting system is functional. No such written records shall be erased, mutilated or changed. Written records shall be open and available for review upon request by the city treasurer or any peace officer during regular business hours.

Sec. 25-117. - Secondhand dealer not to act as a pawnbroker. 
    No secondhand dealer shall receive any article or thing by way of pledge or pawn, nor shall he loan or advance any sum of money on the security of any article or thing, unless he also happens to be separately licensed as a pawnbroker under this article, and complies with the specific requirements of sections 25-115 and 25-116 of this article. 
(Ord. No. O11-028, § 1, 6-28-11) 
Sec. 25-118. - Waiting periods. 
    No articles received on deposit or pledge by any pawnbroker, shall be permitted to be redeemed or removed from the place of business of such pawnbroker for the space of forty-eight (48) hours after the delivery of the signed receipt required by Section 25-115. No articles pawned or pledged shall be sold or disposed of by any pawnbroker within one (1) year from the time the pawner or pledger shall make default in the payment of interest on the money so advanced by the pawnbroker, unless by the written consent of the pawner or pledger. 
    No pawnbroker or secondhand dealer shall expose for sale, or sell, trade or barter, or melt, crush/compact, destroy, or otherwise dispose of, any non-scrap/junk article that is individually identifiable within thirty (30) days of the time of purchasing or receiving the same, nor until the same has been in or upon the premises where the same are offered, exposed, traded, bartered or sold, at least thirty (30) days, unless the article consists primarily of precious metal(s). Due to fluctuations in the prices of precious metals and security concerns emanating from the accumulation of large quantities of precious metals, there shall be no waiting period for such articles, even if they are individually identifiable. 
    There shall be no waiting period for scrap/junk, coins, paper money or other nonindividually identifiable articles. 
(Ord. No. O11-028, § 1, 6-28-11; Ord. No. O12-008, § 1, 2-28-12) 
Sec. 25-119. - Prohibited transactions.

(2)  Any person appearing to be intoxicated or under the influence of drugs or alcohol. 
(3)  Any person known to the pawnbroker or secondhand dealer to have been convicted of theft, residential burglary, burglary, home invasion, vehicular invasion, armed robbery, robbery or electronic fencing under the laws of the State of Illinois, or the equivalent laws of any other state. A peace officer may provide such criminal conviction information to a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer, and a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer may also access the LeadsOnline "No Buy" list prior to making a transaction to ensure that the prospective pawner/seller has not been convicted of any such crime. 
(4)  Any person bringing such articles to the premises in a shopping cart. 
(5)  Any person presenting a serial numbered non-scrap/junk article from which the serial number has been removed or obliterated. 
    In the event that any of the above enumerated persons shall attempt to conduct a prohibited transaction, a representative of that business shall notify the police department of the incident while the person is still present in the business if safe to do so, or otherwise as soon as the person has left the business. 
(Ord. No. O11-028, § 1, 6-28-11) 
Sec. 25-120. - Report of false/fictitious/forged/altered ID card. 
    In the event that a person seeking to sell or pawn any item presents to the owner/operator/employee of a pawn or resale shop what is reasonably believed to be a false/fictitious/forged/altered ID card, a representative of that business shall notify the police department of the incident while the person is still present in the business if safe to do so, or otherwise as soon as the person has left the business. 
(Ord. No. O11-028, § 1, 6-28-11) 
Sec. 25-121. - Report of lost or stolen articles to police.

DIVISION 2. - LICENSE 

Sec. 25-131. - Required. 
    No person shall engage in, carry on or conduct the business of a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer, or operate or cause to be operated any motor vehicle for the purpose of the commercial collecting or disposing of junk/scrap within the city, unless he is licensed to do so. 
    A pawnbroker's license, secondhand dealer's license, and scrap/junk collection vehicle license are separate from each other, and the license shall state which it is for. Persons may hold more than one (1) license under this section. 
    A pawnbroker's license shall entitle the licensee to engage in the purchase, sale, trade or barter of non-junk/scrap secondhand articles in addition to the business of receiving property in pledge or as security for money or other things, but shall not entitle the licensee to the use of a junk/scrap collection vehicle. 
    A secondhand dealer's license will entitle the licensee to the use of one (1) junk/scrap collection vehicle, but shall not entitle the licensee to engage in the business of a pawnbroker. Each additional motor vehicle used for such purpose shall require a separate license and fee in the amount specified annually by resolution or ordinance in the city. 
    No license for a junk/scrap collection vehicle shall be issued for less than the full annual license fee. 
    Violation of this section shall be a Class III misdemeanor, and shall also result in proceedings to revoke any other city-issued business license the person may hold.

Such application shall also set out the location at which it is intended or desired to conduct such business, and such other information as the city treasurer shall from time to time deem appropriate. 
    Any false information provided on the application shall result in the denial or revocation of the license. 
(Ord. No. O11-028, § 1, 6-28-11) 
Sec. 25-133. - License to state location of business. 
    Every license granted to any pawnbroker or secondhand dealer under the provisions of this division shall designate the place in which the person receiving the license shall be authorized to carry on such business. Such business shall not be carried on or conducted in any other place than that designated by the license. 
    Every license granted to any owner of a junk/scrap collection vehicle under the provisions of this division shall designate the business location and phone number that the vehicle operates from, or if none, then the street address and phone number of the licensee's residence. 
(Ord. No. O11-028, § 1, 6-28-11) 
Sec. 25-134. - Change of location of business. 
    In case any person licensed as a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer shall remove his place of business from the place designated on such license, no business shall be carried on or engaged in at the new location under such license until written notice of such change has been given by the licensee to the city treasurer, and such change has been noted by the city treasurer upon such license. The address of his place of business shall thereupon be changed on the sides of any vehicle used by such licensed pawnbroker or dealer, and made to correspond with such new place of business. 
    Any change in the address listed on the license for a junk/scrap collection vehicle shall be provided in writing to the city treasurer, who shall note such change upon said license. No junk/scrap collection shall be carried on or engaged in by the licensee until such notification and change has been made, and until the address of the licensee's place of business or residence shall be changed on the sides and rear of the licensed vehicle, and made to correspond with such new address. 
(Ord. No. O11-028, § 1, 6-28-11) 
Sec. 25-135. - License to be publicly posted. 
    Every license granted under this article shall be conspicuously posted for public viewing so as to be seen by anyone entering the place of business of such pawnbroker or secondhand dealer, whether that place of business is a fixed storefront or temporary, non-fixed location, or in any vehicle licensed under this article.

Sec. 25-136. - Bond. 
    Every person licensed as a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer shall at the time of receiving the license execute a bond to the city in the sum of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) with good and sufficient sureties, conditioned for the due observance of the ordinances of the city respecting pawnbrokers, loanbrokers or keepers of loan offices or secondhand dealers, to be returned upon sale or closure of business, or expiration of the license, whichever comes last.

Sec. 25-137. - Issuance of license; fee. 
    The city treasurer shall grant licenses to such pawn broker, secondhand dealer or junk/scrap collection vehicle applicants as shall pass a background check conducted by the Police Department's sworn officer designated to perform that task, to engage in the business of a pawnbroker or secondhand dealer at, or operate a junk/scrap collection vehicle from, the place designated in the application for and during the period of such license, upon payment by the applicant to the city of an annual license fee in the amount specified annually by resolution or ordinance in the city. 
    Any person employed by or providing volunteer work for the licensee at the business or in the vehicle for which the license is sought, at any time during the period of the license, shall also be required to pass a background check which may be conducted by the police department's records division or a private firm contracted by the licensee, if that employee or volunteer engages in the collection, receipt, purchase or sale of secondhand or junk/scrap articles. Proof of such background check for each employee or volunteer shall be kept on the premises of businesses licensed under this article, or kept on file at their corporate offices if applicable, and be presented for review within a reasonable amount of time upon request by the police department. 
    The results of all background checks shall be provided to the city treasurer, who shall determine if the applicant has a history of past criminal conduct or criminal associations that would make it not in the best interests of the citizens of Aurora to issue a license to the applicant to engage in such business. 
    A license shall only be issued to the actual owner, operator or manager of the business or vehicle for which the license is sought.

Where the lessor complies with the provisions of this section, the lessee of the vehicle at the time of the violation shall be deemed to be the owner of the vehicle for purposes of this chapter. The traffic compliance administrator, within thirty (30) days of being notified by the lessor of the name and address of the lessee, shall mail the lessee a citation which contains the information required under Section 11-208.6 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, 625ILCS 5/11-208.6.

Failure of the respondent to pay such fine or penalty within twenty-one (21) days of the date of the notice may result in the immobilization of the person's vehicle pursuant to the procedures described in section 27-65 of this Code. 
(c)  The city shall withdraw a violation notice, following reasonable collection efforts, when the notice was issued to a registered owner who is deceased at the time collection efforts are undertaken.

Sec. 29-125. - Findings of the city council. 
    The city council hereby finds as follows: 
(1)  The repeated commission of criminal offenses and violations of the City's Municipal Code substantially annoys and injures the health, comfort, repose and safety of the public. 
(2)  The failure of owners or managers of certain real property to control the activity occurring on their property causes repeated and substantial expenditures of public funds in order to enforce state, federal and city laws upon or near their property. Among the property management practices that contribute to the existence of activities which disturb neighborhoods are the failure of owners or managers of real property to require tenants to obey laws as a condition of leases, the failure to enforce existing provisions of leases, the failure of owners or managers to respond to or take affirmative steps to address complaints by adjoining owners, and the overall tolerance by owners or managers of criminal activity on property by tenants or their guests, all of which substantially annoys and injures the health, comfort, repose and safety of the public. 
(3)  The decline in or depression of surrounding property values and the expenditures of public funds results in part from the fact that certain property owners or managers fail to adequately manage and control their property. 
(4)  The provisions of this article will assist the city in the long term to renew certain neighborhoods by lessening the expenditures of public funds, increasing property values, preserving the tranquility of neighborhoods, and deterring property owners and managers from adopting inadequate management practices.

The hearing officer's decision shall be final and binding, except that the administrative review law, as specified in section 12-192 of this Code, shall be applicable. The findings, decision and order shall include the hearing officer's findings of fact, a decision whether or not a code violation exists based upon the finding of fact, and an order for abatement of the nuisance activity or sanctioning the person in charge/owner/occupant, as specified in [subsection (e)] below, or dismissing the case in the event a violation is not proved.

Each day a nuisance activity occurs or continues shall be considered a separate and distinct violation.

No person shall be found in violation of this section unless the city proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the person in charge/owner/occupant failed to take reasonable and warranted measures to abate the nuisance activity.

Sec. 29-130. - Charge for nuisance services. 
    The city council finds that any premises that has generated more calls for police service for nuisance activities after being declared a nuisance property has received more than the level of general and adequate police service and has placed an undue and inappropriate burden on the taxpayers of the city. The city council therefore directs the chief of police to charge the owners of such premises the costs associated with abating nuisance violations as defined herein at such premises for a period of one (1) year, after which, charging for the services will cease unless the council reconsiders the facts and determines to continue to charge for such services.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 37-1. - Declaration. 
(a)  Over the last few decades, unprecedented development has taken place in and around the city.

These properties and areas are important sources of the city's traditions and stability. 
(b)  In the interest of the public health, safety and general welfare and pursuant to sound urban planning principles those properties and areas that have special historical, architectural, community or aesthetic significance should be preserved, enhanced and restored to use.

Structures owned by the city shall not require a certificate of appropriateness where there has been a determination by the city council that a demolition is in the best interest of the city or the safety of its residents. The applicable code official shall forward a notice of the proposed demolition to the commission at least four (4) weeks prior to the city council's call for a vote, unless it is a month where there is a fifth Wednesday, in which case such notice shall be sent six (6) weeks prior to the city council's call for a vote on the proposed demolition.

During this period of delay, the commission shall investigate plans to allow for a reasonably beneficial use or a reasonable economic return, or to otherwise preserve the subject property and improvements. Such plans may include, but are not limited to, a relaxation of the provisions of this chapter. 
e.  If by the end of this six-month period the commission has found that, without approval of the proposed work, the property and improvements cannot be put to a reasonably beneficial use or the owner cannot obtain a reasonable economic return there from, then the commission shall issue a certificate of economic hardship approving the proposed work.

The appeal must be accompanied by a written explanation as to all the reasons why the full amount on the statement should not be charged to the person and why the responsible party believes the costs assessed pursuant to this chapter should be modified. Any reason, basis or argument for a modification of the assessed costs not set forth in the written request to appeal shall be deemed waived by the responsible party. Failure to file a written appeal within fourteen (14) days of the date of the statement of assessed costs shall constitute a waiver of the responsible party's right to appeal and to appear before the city council.

(d)  On appeal of a determination of assessable costs, the city council shall, within a reasonable time, reverse, affirm, or modify the determination appealed from. If the city council determines that the person is not liable for any or all the expense of the emergency or that payment of the expense of the emergency response will impose an undue hardship, the city council may waive any or all of the expense. The decision of the city council shall be final when made. The city clerk shall then send a statement of assessed costs to the responsible party, by first class United States mail, with postage prepaid, to the last known address of the responsible party. The assessed costs shall be due and payable thirty (30) days from the date of that statement. If the responsible party fails to pay the assessed costs within those thirty (30) days, the city shall have available to it all remedies available under subsection (e) below. The findings and decision of the city council shall be in writing and filed with the finance department. 
(e)  If a statement of expenses is not paid in full or appealed within thirty (30) days of the date of the statement, or paid in full within thirty (30) days of the denial of an appeal, the city, to the extent allowed by applicable law, may pursue any responsible party under one or more of the subsections below.

The corporation counsel shall file a notice of lien within two (2) years after such cost and expense is incurred, which notice of lien shall be filed in the office of the appropriate county recorder of deeds. 
(3)  The failure to pay any debt due the city, including, but not limited to, amounts owed on account of a fee, lease, rent, service, sale of real or personal property, overpayment, administrative or judicial judgment, fine, penalty, restitution, damages, interest, tax, reimbursement, recovery of a cost incurred by the city or other source of indebtedness to the city, after the period granted for payment has expired by any person liable for such debt, shall constitute a violation of this chapter. Judgment shall be entered against any person who violates this chapter in the amount of the debt remaining unpaid on the date the judgment is entered plus litigation and collection costs, attorney's fees and an amount representing all fines and penalties assessed pursuant to this chapter. An administrative penalty of one (1) percent of the amount of debt remaining unpaid on the date the judgment is entered shall be assessed for each month or portion thereof in which the debt remained unpaid. 
a.  In addition to any other means authorized by law, the city may enforce this chapter by instituting an action through its administrative adjudication system. 
b.  Nothing in this chapter shall preclude the city from seeking to collect any debt due the city through the use of any other administrative procedure or court proceeding authorized by law. 
(f)  Any expenses collected pursuant to this chapter shall be supplemental to other methods of financing emergency response, including but not limited to budget appropriations, ad valorem taxation, grants, and other sources permitted by law.

Sec. 41-1. - Purposes. 
    This chapter is adopted in relation to the establishment of minimum regulations for the design, construction, alteration, repair, removal, maintenance and use of signs within the city, for the following purposes: 
(1)  To promote commerce by improving the appearance of the city. Attractive, easily readable signage makes for high quality entryways into the city, thus drawing development, tourists, new residents and customers. 
(2)  To stabilize neighborhoods by promoting quality signage. Signage which complements the architecture, is in keeping with the scale of a building and its zoning district, and makes for an easily understandable streetscape, results in more appealing commercial areas, which help to anchor and define neighborhoods. 
(3)  To preserve the value of private property by promoting the compatibility of signs with surrounding land uses. Varying the permitted size and control of signs depending on the zoning district, will assist promotion of compatibility and preservation of values. 
(4)  To increase traffic safety by reducing distractions. With a reasonable level of signage confronting a motorist, one is better able to notice, consider and react to traffic-control devices in a timely and safe manner. 
(5)  To better assist the public in locating the business or use desired in the most effective manner. Signs should clearly identify the business or use even more importantly than to advertise it, and should be in an appropriate visual scale with the surrounding uses, to enable comfortable and prompt recognition and awareness. 
(6)  To protect the public from potential collapse and fire. By regulating construction and placement of signs, the public can be better protected from the possibility of fire, electric shock or sign collapse. 
(7)  To give all businesses and services a fair chance to identify themselves, thus denying to no entity in particular a reasonable use of the sight lines available in local commerce. By application of objective rules to all signage, each may reasonably be seen from the public way in a fair and appropriate manner. 
(8)  To promote signage appropriate to the zoning district-either pedestrian-oriented or automobile-oriented. 
(9)  To recognize the critical nature of and encourage solutions for the special or unique problems and circumstances attendant upon the resources and development of the downtown core.

(Ord. No. O03-159, § 1, 12-9-03) 
Sec. 41-7. - Oversize off-premises commercial signs. 
(a)  Oversize off-premises commercial signs represent a special privilege granted by the city to advertisers to enable them to use the environment for marketing purposes. Such signs derive their profitability solely from use of the public investment embodied in public roads, and offer no additional public benefit such as identification of premises. Therefore, certain additional considerations arise in their regulation. Such signs by definition do not conform to the restrictions otherwise placed upon business signs by section 41-4 of this chapter, and are therefore: 
(1)  Detrimental to property values, the character and quality of neighborhoods, and highway safety; 
(2)  Out-of-scale with pedestrian areas and most buildings; 
(3)  Potential hazards to life and property and potential harbors for criminal activity; 
(4)  Accumulators of junk; 
(5)  Obstructers of light, air and sun; 
(6)  Incompatible with quality building rehabilitation, and with historic architecture, revitalization of existing commercial areas, economic development, and the attraction of image-conscious, high-quality commercial and industrial firms, which attraction is a stated policy of the city; 
(7)  Otherwise in contravention to the stated purposes of this chapter; and 
(8)  Detrimental to aesthetic values and to the public health, safety and welfare otherwise.

(4)  No such sign shall be permitted as a wall sign. 
(5)  No such sign shall be permitted as a roof sign.

(9)  Such signs shall be aesthetically improved by the regular maintenance of the immediate area surrounding the sign (twenty (20) feet in all directions), including maintaining the height of any surrounding weeds or grass at eight (8) inches or less. 
(10)  In addition to the information required in section 41-10(a) hereof, permit applications for such signs shall include: 
a.  A site plan, drawn to scale, showing all setbacks, abutting roadways, abutting zoning, landscape materials, and the proposed sign and its orientation and lighting;

2.  No such sign whose face is oriented to and visible from Stolp Island, shall be located less than six hundred sixty (660) feet from Stolp Island. 
f.  Such signs in existing high-density commercial areas are particularly discouraging of pedestrian uses, detrimental to property values, out of scale with most buildings, potential hazards to life and property, wrongfully disadvantageous to nearby businesses, and incompatible with revitalization of such areas.

3.  Any tree or shrub thereon that dies shall be replaced by the end of the next planting season. 
d.  The new construction of such signs on arterial streets shall be prohibited except that: 
1.  Upon the effective date of this chapter, the total existing number of such sign faces in the city, other than those along primary highways, shall be verified and that total number shall represent the maximum allowable number of such sign faces on arterial streets hereunder; and 
2.  Upon removal of any such existing sign faces, the owner thereof shall have sixty (60) days to apply for and receive a permit to replace such sign faces on one (1) or more structures. If application is not made within said sixty (60) days, a permit shall be granted to the first applicant who files for a new permit and meets the requirements applicable to such application. 
e.  Such signs in historic districts are incompatible with the purpose and goals of such districts. Therefore:

Sec. 41.5-100. - Findings. 
(a)  The city council finds that the city's festivals, races, parades, and other special events contribute to the unique character of the city. Special events throughout the city range from small neighborhood-level events to large-scale productions and these events held in the city can impact public safety and the flow of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. As such, allowing a special event permit application, would allow public safety personnel the ability to plan and manage public safety personnel and resources. 
(b)  A special event permit application process will allow the city to manage the competing uses of its public spaces and ensure that members of the public are able to access public space for their events. Many events have to apply for multiple permits and having an intergovernmental team acting as a "one stop shop" for special events will provide a single point of contact for event organizers and the public.

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. O17-082, Exh. A, adopted November 14, 2017, amended article X in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former article X, §§ 42-300-42-326, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. O07-126, § 2, 11-23-07; Ord. No. O16-084, § 1, 12-13-16; Ord. No. O17-053, Exh. A, 8-8-17. 

Sec. 42-300. - Purpose and scope. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish policies and procedures for the construction of facilities on rights-of-way within the city's jurisdiction that will provide public benefit consistent with the preservation of the integrity, safe usage, and visual qualities of the city rights-of-way and the city as a whole. 
(b)  Intent. In enacting this article, the city intends to exercise its authority over the rights-of-way in the city and, in particular, the use of the public ways and property by utilities, by establishing uniform standards to address issues presented by such facilities in the public rights-of-way, including without limitation: 
(1)  Prevent interference with the use of streets, sidewalks, alleys, parkways and other public ways and places; 
(2)  Prevent the creation of visual and physical obstructions and other conditions that are hazardous to vehicular and pedestrian traffic; 
(3)  Prevent interference with the installation, maintenance, and operation of facilities, the city's utilities and of other utilities lawfully located in rights-of-way or public property; 
(4)  Protect against environmental damage, including damage to trees, from the installation of facilities; 
(5)  Protect against increased stormwater run-off due to structures and materials that increase impermeable surfaces; 
(6)  Preserve the character of the neighborhoods in which facilities are installed; 
(7)  Preserve open space, particularly the tree-lined parkways that characterize the city's residential neighborhoods; 
(8)  Prevent visual blight from the proliferation of facilities in the rights-of-way; and 
(9)  Assure the continued safe use and enjoyment of private properties adjacent to facilities locations. 
(c)  Facilities subject to this article. This article applies to all facilities established or to be established on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the rights-of-way within the jurisdiction of the city. A facility lawfully established prior to the effective date of this article may continue to be maintained, repaired and operated as presently constructed and located, except that, if any existing facility is expanded, extended, replaced or upgraded, such expansion, extension, replacement or upgrade shall be done in compliance with this article. Further, if a facility lawfully established prior to the effective date of this article is subject to a franchise agreement that establishes regulations pertaining to facilities in the public rights-of-way, the franchise agreement shall apply until the franchise agreement expires or the parties agree to terminate the provisions of such franchise agreement pertaining to facilities in the rights-of-way. 
(d)  Franchises, licenses, or similar agreements. The city, in its discretion and as limited by law, may require utilities or other service providers having a legal right to use a right-of-way to enter into a franchise, license or similar agreement for the privilege of locating their facilities on, over, above, along, upon, under, across, or within the city rights-of-way. Utilities that are not required by law to enter into such an agreement may request that the city enter into such an agreement. In such an agreement, the city and utility may provide for terms and conditions that differ from this article, but which are not materially inconsistent with this article, and which are in the public interest, as the parties may agree. 
(e)  Effect of franchises, licenses, or similar agreements. If a utility has a franchise, license or similar agreement with the city, such franchise, license or similar agreement shall govern and control the use of public rights-of-way during the term of such agreement and any lawful renewal or extension thereof to the extent that the franchise, license or similar agreement sets forth standards and conditions pertaining to the use of the rights-of-way. To the extent that a franchise, license or similar agreement is silent with regard to standards and conditions for use of rights-of-way this chapter shall apply. 
(f)  Conflicts with other code provisions. This article supersedes all other Aurora Code provisions or parts of provisions adopted prior hereto that are in conflict herewith with respect to facilities of utilities in the rights-of-way, to the extent of such conflict, including chapter 42, article II, division 2, sections 42-40, 42-45, 42-46; chapter 42, article III, division 2, sections 42-101 through 42-105; chapter 42 article IX, sections 42-271 through 42-277; provided that those provisions shall remain applicable to all users of rights-of-way other than utilities, as defined herein. 
(g)  Conflicts with state and federal laws. In the event that applicable federal or state laws or regulations conflict with the requirements of this article, the utility shall comply with the requirements of this article to the maximum extent possible unless preempted or a violation of such federal or state laws or regulations. 
(h)  Sound engineering judgment. The city shall use sound engineering judgment when administering this article and may vary the standards, conditions, and requirements expressed in this article when the city so determines consistent with generally accepted engineering principles. Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the city to regulate its rights-of-way for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare.

A facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in the following circumstances: 
(1)  Upon expiration or termination of the utility's license or franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law; 
(2)  If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior grant of a license or franchise, if required; 
(3)  If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance of a required permit in violation of this article; or

All costs associated with the repair, replacement, or relocation of the facilities cut or removed by the city, shall be borne by the facility owner. 
(d)  Abandonment of facilities. In the event the use of a facility has been discontinued for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) consecutive days, within the rights-of-way of the city, the facility shall be deemed to be abandoned. Determination of the date of abandonment shall be made by the city engineer, who shall have the right to request documentation and/or affidavits from the utility regarding the issue of the facility's use. Upon the city engineer's determination and written notification to the utility of such abandonment, the utility shall have ninety (90) days within which to: (1) reactivate the actual use of the facility or transfer the facility to another utility which makes actual use of the facility; or (2) dismantle and remove the facility and notify the city engineer in writing of the completion of such removal. Following the end of the ninety-day period from the date of receipt of such notice from the city, if no action has been taken under subsections (1) or (2) hereinabove, the city engineer may direct the utility to remove all or any portion of the facility if it is determined that such removal will be in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare. At the earlier date of either (1) two hundred and seventy (270) days from the date of discontinuance without reactivation, or (2) upon completion of dismantling or removal, any special exception or variance approval for the facility shall automatically expire without further action by the city. In the event that the city does not direct the utility that abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice of abandonment to the city, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent to the alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by another utility or person.

If a hazard does not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations, adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility is available. 
(2)  In an emergency, the utility shall, as soon as possible, notify the city engineer or his or her duly authorized agent of the emergency, informing him or her as to what steps have been taken for protection of the traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of traffic, the city police shall be notified immediately. 
(3)  In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to the traveling public, including immediate repairs of damaged street lights and traffic signal lights.

(2)  All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are impracticable in relation to the requested approach. 
(d)  Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for authorizing a variance, the city engineer may require the utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be expressly be contained within this article but which carry out the purposes of this article. 
(e)  Right to appeal.

Each day a violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. 
    There may be times when the city will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this article. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the city's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit related cost apportionment of the city. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility that does not pay the costs apportioned to it.

Sec. 44-125. - Notice of tax liability; demand for payment of tax; period of limitation. 
(a)  In the event any person fails to file a return when and as herein required, or if it shall appear to the treasurer or his or her designee that the amount of any tax payment is incorrect in that it does not include all taxes payable for such calendar period, or if the treasurer or his or her designee shall find that the collection of any taxes which have accrued but are not yet due will be jeopardized by delay, and declares said taxes to be immediately due and payable, or if it shall appear to the treasurer or his or her designee that he had made any final assessment which did not include taxes payable for the periods involved, or if it appears to the treasurer or his or her designee that any person has, by reason of any act or omission or by operation of any law, become liable for any taxes, interest or penalties not originally incurred by him, the treasurer or his or her designee may in any of the above events determine and assess the amount of such taxes or deficiency, as the case may be, together with the interest and penalties due and unpaid. 
(b)  Any such determination and assessment shall be made by the treasurer or his or her designee upon his best judgment and information, and it shall be permissible for the treasurer or his or her designee to show an estimated figure that represents the tax due for any given six (6) months instead of showing the amount of tax due for each month separately. The treasurer or his or her designee shall immediately serve notice of tax liability, by any means set forth in section 44-127 of this chapter, to such person, making a demand for payment of the tax together with interest and penalties thereon. If the person incurring any such liability has died, such demand may at the discretion of the treasurer or his or her designee be made against his personal representative. If the person fails to pay the amount set forth in the notice of tax liability within twenty (20) days from date of the notice of tax liability the treasurer or his or her designee shall commence administrative hearings pursuant to section 44-126. 
(Code 1969, § 44-125; Ord. No. O87-5685, § 1, 7-7-87; Ord. No. O16-014, § 1, 3-22-16) 
Sec. 44-126. - Hearings; procedure; findings; enforcement of administrative decisions. 
(a)  The city adopts Division 2.1 (the "division") of the Illinois Municipal Code (65 ILCS 5/1-2.1-1, et seq.) as it may be amended from time-to-time and as allowed by said division; provided, however, that the specific provisions of this article shall take precedence over any inconsistent provisions contained within said division. 
(b)  When an owner has failed to pay the amount set forth in notice of tax liability issued pursuant to section 44-125 or there is any other violation of this article, the treasurer or his or her designee shall initiate administrative proceedings against said owner by preparing a summons along with a copy of the notice of tax liability, indicating the name and address of the owner, the type and nature of the violation, and the date(s) of the violation and a hearing date. The hearing date shall not be less than thirty (30) nor more than forty-five (45) days from the date the summons is issued. 
(c)  One (1) copy of the notice of tax liability and summons shall be maintained in the files of the finance department and shall be part of the record of hearing and one (1) copy of the notice of tax liability and summons shall be served, via any method set forth in section 44-127 of this article, to the owner, commanding the owner to appear at a hearing. If the name of the owner cannot be ascertained or if service on the owner cannot be made by mail, service may be made on the owner by posting or nailing a copy of the violation report form on the front door of the establishment where the violation was found, not less than twenty (20) days before the hearing date. 
(d)  At any time prior to the hearing date, the hearing officer assigned to hear the case may, at the request of the treasurer or his or her designee or the attorney for the city, or the owner or his attorney, issue subpoenas directing witnesses to appear and give testimony at the hearing. 
(e)  If on the date set for hearing the owner or his attorney fails to appear, the hearing officer may find the owner in default and shall proceed with the hearing and accept evidence relevant to the existence of a violation of this article. 
(f)  No continuances shall be authorized by the hearing officer in proceedings under this article except in cases where a continuance is absolutely necessary to protect the rights of the owner. Lack of preparation shall not be grounds for a continuance. Any continuance under this article shall not exceed thirty (30) days, unless otherwise authorized by the hearing officer. The case for the city may be presented by the treasurer, his or her designee, or by any other city employee or by an attorney designated by the city. The case for the owner may be presented by the owner, his attorney, or any other authorized agent or representative of owner. 
(g)  At the hearing, a hearing officer shall preside and shall hear testimony and accept any evidence relevant to the existence or nonexistence of a violation of this article. The strict rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings shall not apply to hearings authorized by this article. 
(h)  It shall be a defense to a violation charged under this article if the owner, his attorney, or any other agent or representative proves to the hearing officer's satisfaction that the violation alleged in the notice does not in fact exist or if the payment of the amount set forth in the notice of tax liability has been made, or at the time of the hearing the violation has been remedied or removed; provided, however, that if the violation alleged in the notice has been charged to the owner on the same food establishment or liquor establishment any time within the preceding twelve (12) months, then it shall not be a defense if at the time of hearing the violation has been remedied or removed. 
(i)  At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall make a determination, on the basis of the evidence presented at the hearing, whether or not a violation exists. The determination shall be in writing and shall be designated as the findings, decision and order. The findings, decision and order shall include the hearing officer's findings of fact, a decision whether or not a violation exists based upon the findings of fact, and an order, ordering the owner to correct the violation or dismissing the case in the event a violation is not proved. If a violation is proved, the hearing officer may also, without limitation, impose sanctions, as provided in this article in addition to any amounts set forth in the notice of tax liability, and/or suspend for any period up to thirty (30) days or revoke the privilege tax certificate. A copy of the findings, decision, and order shall be served on the owner; service shall be in the same manner as the report form and summons are served by any method allowed under this article. Payment of any penalty, fine, sanctions, and/or tax liability shall be made to the city finance department and the disposition of fine money may be determined, from time to time, by separate ordinance or resolution of the city council. 
(j)  In the event that the same violation for the same owner is brought before the hearing officer within a twelve-month time period, the hearing officer may, after hearing relevant testimony, retain jurisdiction over the violation, despite any correction thereof, and establish a hearing date or dates to determine continued compliance with the order. At such time, the hearing officer shall hear testimony and accept any evidence relevant to the continued compliance of the property with regard to any said repeated violation. 
(k)  The findings, decision and order of the hearing officer shall be subject to review in the Circuit Court of Kane County, and the provisions of the administrative review law (735 ILCS 5/3-101 et seq.), and all amendments and modifications thereto, and the rules adopted pursuant thereto, are adopted and shall apply to and govern every action for the judicial review of the final findings, decision and order of a hearing officer under this article. 
(l)  Any fine, other sanction or costs imposed, or part of any fine, other sanction or costs imposed remaining unpaid after the exhaustion of, or the failure to exhaust, judicial review procedures under the administrative review law shall be a debt due and owing the city and, as such, may be collected in accordance with applicable law. 
(m)  After expiration of the period within which judicial review under the administrative review law may be sought for a final determination of the code violation, the city may commence a proceeding in the circuit court for purposes of obtaining a judgment on the findings, decision and order. Nothing in this section shall prevent the city from consolidating multiple findings, decisions and orders against a person in such a proceeding. Upon commencement of the action, the city shall file a petition with a court of competent jurisdiction which shall contain a recitation of the relevant facts, findings, decision to show that the findings, decision and order was issued in accordance with this article and applicable state law.

A tax is hereby levied and imposed upon the use and privilege of renting, leasing or letting a hotel room within the city at a rate of three (3) percent of the room rental rate (not including taxes or other nonroom rental charges added to the hotel bill) for each such hotel room rented for every twenty-four-hour period or any fraction thereof.

Sec. 44-193. - Certificate of registration; bond.

Each such application shall be signed and verified by the applicant or a properly accredited agent, which in the case of a corporation shall include the president, any vice-president, the secretary, the treasurer or some other properly accredited agent acceptable to the treasurer.

The treasurer shall fix the amount of such security in each case, taking into consideration the amount of money expected to become due from the applicant under this article. The amount of security required by the treasurer shall be such as in his opinion, will protect the city against failure to pay the amount which may become due from the applicant under this article, but the amount of the security required by the treasurer shall not exceed three (3) times the amount of the applicant's average monthly tax collection and remission liability, or fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), whichever amount is lower, but in no case less than fifty dollars ($50.00).

(e)  If the person so registered states that he operates other such places of business in the city, the treasurer shall furnish him with a subcertificate of registration for each place of business. All subcertificates of registration shall bear the same registration number as that appearing upon the certificate of registration to which such subcertificates related. 
(f)  The certificate of registration shall be conspicuously displayed at the place of business which the person so registered states in his application to be the principal place of business from which he engages in the business of providing hotel accommodations in this city. A subcertificate of registration shall be similarly displayed at the place of business to which it relates. 
(g)  With respect to security other than a bond from a surety company authorized to do business in the state upon which the treasurer may sue in the event of a forfeiture, if the tax collector fails to pay, when due, any amount whose payment such security guarantees, the treasurer shall, after such liability is admitted by the tax collector or established by the treasurer through the issuance of a final assessment that has become final as provided by law, convert the security which that tax collector has furnished into money for the city after first giving the tax collector at least ten (10) days' written notice, by registered or certified mail, to pay the liability or forfeit such security to the treasurer. If the security consists of a bank certificate of deposit, the treasurer shall convert the security into money by demanding and collecting the amount of such bank certificate of deposit from the bank which issued such certificate. If the treasurer realizes more from the security than the amount of such liability plus the expenses incurred by the treasurer in converting the security into money, the treasurer shall pay such excess to the tax collector who furnished such security and the balance shall be paid into the general fund. 
(h)  The treasurer shall discharge any surety and shall release and return any security deposited, assigned, pledged or otherwise provided to it by a tax collector under this section within thirty (30) days after:

    If water service is discontinued because of a delinquent account as set forth in this article or for any other reason, there shall be a forty dollar ($40.00) fee payable in advance either by the consumer or the owner of the property before water service to the premises is turned back on during regular scheduled working hours.

The division of water meter reading and billing shall mail or cause to be mailed to the premises against which the water bill is charged a statement setting forth the nature and the amount of the bill then remaining unpaid as soon as practicable after the date of such delinquency, but failure to mail such notice shall in no way affect the obligation of the consumer to pay the bill. If any such bill remains unpaid after the expiration of a period of thirty (30) days from the date of the delinquency, the public works department shall cause the water service to such premises to be at once discontinued by turning off the water from the water mains into the premises, and such water service shall not be turned on again except as provided in sections 48-64 and 48-65.

(Code 1969, § 47-27) 
Sec. 48-68. - Creation of lien. 
    The city shall have a continuing lien upon the premises and real estate upon or for which water is used or supplied for all water rents, charges or benefits accruing by benefit of the reasons of this article. Every such lien shall, upon compliance with the conditions set forth in this division become and be prior and superior to the rights and interests of creditors, encumbrances, purchasers and other parties in interest in the premises and real estate. 
(Code 1969, § 47-28) 
Sec. 48-69. - Filing of lien; defects not fatal. 
    Whenever a bill for water rates, charges, services or benefits remains unpaid for a period of thirty (30) days after the due date thereof, the corporation counsel shall file with the recorder of deeds of the county, a statement of lien claims verified by the affidavit of himself or by the affidavit of some other person having knowledge of the facts. The statement as contained in the affidavit shall contain a sufficiently correct description of the lot, lots or tracts of land to identify the same, the balance due after allowing all credits, and a statement that the city claims a lien for this amount, as well as for all charges for water supplied subsequent to the period covered by the statement. No such lien shall be defeated to the proper amount thereof because of an error or overcharge on the part of the city, nor shall any such lien be defeated upon proof that such water was used or contracted for by a tenant of the premises or occupant thereof other than the owner.

Such suits shall be commenced or answered by cross-complaint filed within two (2) years after the accrual of such water rates, charges or benefits. Any decree rendered in the court may be enforced and collected as other decrees or judgments of such court. 
(b)  The corporation counsel shall institute such proceedings in the name of the city in the circuit court against any premises or real estate for which the water bill remains unpaid. 
(c)  The remedy provided in this section for the collection of delinquent water rates, charges, services or benefits shall not be construed to abridge or in any manner interfere with the right and power of the city to enforce a collection thereof by any other action or otherwise, but the remedy shall be taken and held as an additional means to enforce payment of such water rents, rates, charges, services or benefits. 
(Code 1969, § 47-30) 
Sec. 48-71. - Settling disputed bills. 
    If a water consumer disputes the amount of the water bill charged him, or a consumer questions the accuracy of the meter for which data for computing the bill was obtained, then the city will, at the written request of the consumer, cause tests and examinations of the meter to be made to determine its accuracy. If it is found as a result of such test that the meter registers a greater or less amount of water than is actually passed through it in excess of the allowable variation of two (2) percent, the division of water meter reading and billing shall have authority to adjust the error either positively or negatively so that the water charge against the consumer shall be that computed for the amount of water that actually passed through such meter. In no case, however, where water service has been rendered for six (6) months or a portion thereof, shall the bill be adjusted below the minimum charges as set by this article, and provided also, that no such adjustment shall be made if request for adjustment has not been made prior to the time such bill becomes delinquent. No charges shall be made for water leaking from the service pipe that has not passed through the meter nor shall any deduction or allowance be made with respect to the bill on account of leakage after water has passed through the meter. 
(Code 1969, § 47-31) 
Sec. 48-72. - Unauthorized turn-on after service discontinued.

Each and every day for which the water is turned on after the water is turned off shall be construed as a separate and distinct offense. 
(Code 1969, § 47-32; Ord. No. O02-94, § 18, 9-10-02; Ord. No. O05-125, § 5, 11-8-05) 
Sec. 48-73. - Final bill. 
    Any person or party vacating any premises receiving city water shall request a final reading of the water meter by the city before vacating said premises. All requests to the city for a final reading of the water meter shall be made no less than five (5) days prior to the date of the anticipated property transfer or vacation. Upon receiving such a request the city shall take a final reading of the water meter and prepare a bill to be submitted to the consumer for payment. In accordance with section 44-224 of this Code, the city treasurer shall not issue any real estate transfer tax stamps for the subject property until said bill is paid. In the event a final reading of the water meter is not possible prior to the transfer of property for which real estate transfer tax stamps are required, the consumer shall pay a reasonable amount as determined by the city. In the event the final reading shows the consumer still owes the city money, said consumer shall promptly pay the city any outstanding sums. In the event the final reading shows the consumer has paid in excess of the amount due, the city shall promptly refund said excess to the consumer.

Sec. 48-104. - Special sewer P.E. use fee in the city's Fox River Corridor Area. 
(a)  The city council hereby finds as follows: 
(1)  The City of Aurora has a population of more than twenty-five thousand (25,000) persons and is, therefore, a home rule unit under Section 6(a) of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution of 1970. 
(2)  Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution of 1970, a home rule unit may exercise any power and perform any function pertaining to its government and affairs for the protection of the public health, safety, morals and welfare. 
(3)  Pursuant to Resolution No. R06-133, approved on March 28, 2006, the city entered into an Intergovernmental Agreement ("agreement") with the Fox Metro Water Reclamation District for the construction of improvements to the combined storm and sanitary sewer system ("improved system") serving the Fox River Corridor Area ("corridor area") of the city which area had been served by the said combined storm and sanitary sewer system ("combined system"). 
(4)  Said combined system was at capacity, and overflows would occur during periods of heavy rain. 
(5)  As a result of the overflows of the combined system, new construction and redevelopment, which increase the flows into said combined system beyond the flows occurring prior to said new construction and redevelopment, could not take place without negatively impacting the environment and the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the city, and further overburdening said combined system. 
(6)  Said improved system contemplated by the agreement has been completed and has allowed and will continue to allow new construction and redevelopment to occur in the corridor area of the city in an environmentally safe manner. 
(7)  That re-developments of existing buildings and the construction of new buildings within the corridor area of the city, which is graphically depicted in Exhibit A-1 attached to Ordinance No. 010-09 and made part hereof [as if fully set out] (the "ordinance") and legally described in Exhibit A-2 attached to the ordinance and made part hereto [as if fully set out], including properties adjoining or contiguous to said area which are or will be connected to the improved system, which take place after the completion of the improved system and the enactment of the ordinance, will have a benefit from the improved system, and should, as part of the sewer connection/building permit process, pay their proportionate share of the costs of said improved system. 
(8)  Pursuant to the agreement, an additional twenty-two thousand five hundred (22,500) population equivalents (P.E.) were created within the improved system for the benefit of the corridor area. 
(9)  That based on the cost for the improved system, (inclusive of debt service costs in relation thereto), the cost per newly created P.E. within the improved system for the benefit of the corridor area is hereby established as eight hundred and forty dollars ($840.00), unless otherwise provided for in any redevelopment agreement entered into by the city prior to the effective date of the ordinance, in which case the cost per newly created P.E. for the property covered by any such redevelopment agreement shall be as set forth in said redevelopment agreement, with five hundred seventy-one dollars and twelve cents ($571.12) of said per P.E. amount to be reimbursed to Fox Metro Water Reclamation District to cover half of the total improved system project cost including debt service. 
(b)  For any redevelopment of an existing building or the construction of a new building within the corridor area, including properties adjoining or contiguous to said corridor area, or which are adjacent to a right of way that is part of the perimeter of the corridor area, and which are or will be connected to the improved system, which occurs after __________, 2010, and requires a building permit (the "post-system improvement development"), an additional fee of eight hundred forty dollars ($840.00) per P.E. is required (the "Fox River Corridor Area P.E. Use Fee"). The determination of the amount of said fee due and payable at the time of obtaining building permit shall be made by city staff using the pre-redevelopment/construction P.E. for the property in question and the post-redevelopment/construction P.E. for the property in question. In this regard, where a building existed on the property on March 28, 2006, but has since been demolished, the P.E. of said building, as opposed to the vacant land P.E., shall be used as the pre-redevelopment/construction P.E. for the property in question. The determination as required by this subsection shall be made in accordance with the following criteria: 
(1)  The pre-redevelopment/construction P.E. and post development/construction P.E. shall be determined by the P.E. properly documented and on file with the city from previous permit applications or by plans of the existing and proposed building(s), submitted to the city by the developer, that identify the total P.E. for the property in question pursuant to a plumbing plan of the existing and proposed plumbing fixtures and outlets and/or residential use or any combination thereof. 
Any such plans or documentation shall be prepared and signed/sealed by an Illinois licensed professional engineer or architect. 
(2)  For residential occupancy uses, the pre-redevelopment/construction P.E. and the post-redevelopment/construction P.E. shall be determined using the following P.E. amounts: 
Type P.E. per Unit Efficiency or Studio Unit 1 1 Bedroom Unit 1.5 2 Bedroom Unit 3 3 Bedroom Unit 3 Single-Family Detached Dwelling 3.5 Mobile Home 2.25  
(3)  For non-residential occupancy uses, the pre-redevelopment/construction P.E. and post-redevelopment/construction P.E. shall be determined by using the chart set forth in subsection (iii) below, based on the total number of plumbing outlet units (hereinafter "POUs"). POUs for non-specific uses shall be determined based on the type and total number of plumbing fixtures as set forth in subsection (i) below. POUs for specific uses shall be based on the specific use as set forth in subsection (ii) below. The total POUs shall be the sum of the non-specific use POUs and the specific use POUs applicable to the non-residential occupancy use, rounded to the nearest whole number, with partial POUs of five-tenths (0.5) or greater being rounded up to the next highest whole number. For buildings that are divided into individual non-residential units, the total POUs shall be determined for each non-residential unit address individually and not for the building as an aggregate of the individual units.

(c)  After the determination as required in subsection (b) has been made by city staff, and as part of the building permit issuance process, the Fox River Corridor Area P.E. Use Fee shall be charged as part of the building permit for any post-system improvement development. For buildings or portions of buildings that are divided into individual non-residential units, the Fox River Corridor Area P.E. Use Fee shall be determined for the submitted permits/plumbing plans for the building and then each non-residential build-out will be subject to the Fox River Corridor Area P.E. Use Fee associated with the proposed increase, based on the POU's proposed with the final building permit. The Fox River Corridor Area P.E. Use Fee shall be based on the following formula: 
{(Post Development or Post Construction PE) - (Pre Development or Pre Construction PE)} × (Dollar Amount As Provided in Subsection (b) Above) = Fox River Corridor PE Use Fee 
(d)  The Fox River Corridor Area P.E. Use Fee shall be in addition to all other permit fees and/or connection charges for any post-system improvement Development. The maximum total P.E. associated with the building/property will perpetually be the sanitary load capacity associated with the site and no refund will be provided to the property owner by reduction of the P.E. thereafter. 
(e)  Where a redevelopment agreement entered into by the city, prior to the effective date of the ordinance and this section, provided for and contemplated the payment of the Fox River Corridor Area P.E. Use Fee, by the developer, at a future date, in regard to the redevelopment of existing buildings or the construction of new buildings that was to take place prior to the enactment of the ordinance and this section, (the "pre-fee construction"), the Fox River Corridor Area P.E. Use Fee, as provided for by this section, shall be applicable to said pre-fee Construction. In this regard, city staff shall calculate the applicable Fox River Corridor Area P.E. Use Fee for any such pre-fee construction, and shall bill the appropriate party(ies) therefor.

Sec. 48-141. - Notice; correction of violations; penalties. 
(a)  If the public works director shall determine that any factory, industry, garage, place of business or other place or the occupant and/or owner of any building, dwelling or other place is not complying with the terms and provisions of this article, then the director or other authorized representative of the city shall serve or cause to be served upon any such person not so complying, a notice in writing stating and setting forth wherein or in what regard such person or party is failing to comply with the terms and provisions of this article and further notifying such person that within one (1) year, or in the case of violations of section 48-133, paragraph (1) sixty (60) days, from the receipt of such notice, or immediately in the case of random inspections of new construction under this article, he shall either cease to discharge such waste, industrial waste or other liquids or solids prohibited by this article or in lieu thereof, if applicable, that such person shall within one (1) year, or in the case of violations of section 48-133, paragraph (1) sixty (60) days, adopt and install such method or methods, process or processes, instrumentalities or apparatus for the treatment of its sewage, industrial wastes and other wastes. From and after the expiration of such applicable period such person shall thereafter continuously and efficiently carry out, operate and maintain such method or methods, process or processes, instrumentalities or apparatus and shall thereafter continuously treat its sewage, industrial wastes and other wastes in such manner that the sewage or effluent discharged from the premises shall be of such character and quality as is permitted by the terms and provisions of this article; provided, however, that if compliance with the terms of this article by such person or party does not require the adoption or installation of any additional methods, equipment, apparatus or instrumentalities, any such person or party shall forthwith from and after the receipt by him or it of such notice thereafter continuously comply with the terms and provisions of this article. In the case of new construction, compliance with this article must be verified by reinspection at the owner's expense prior to receipt of a certificate of occupancy under the zoning ordinance and building code; provided, however, that in the event of a new construction violation within an ongoing development or subdivision, all other current new construction therein shall thereupon be inspected under this article at the developer's expense. If any person or party receiving notice under this section shall produce satisfactory evidence to the city council that he cannot comply with the terms of such notice and the terms and provisions of this article within the applicable period, then the city council, in its discretion, may grant to such person or party such extension of time as the city council shall deem necessary or proper. 
(b)  Additionally, the city council may grant any person or party not in compliance with this article, as it pertains to sanitary and/or stormwater runoff, a variation from the terms and provisions thereof. An application for variance shall be in writing and shall set forth the basis for the variation request. An application for variance may be made at any time, provided, however, that no application will be accepted more than thirty (30) days after a notice of violation has been served. The application shall be acted upon by the city council after first holding a public hearing before the planning and development committee of the council. The hearing shall be held not less than fourteen (14) days after receipt of an application for variance. For all applications, public notice shall be mailed by the applicant. Such notices shall be mailed after a public hearing date has been scheduled by the chairman of the planning and development committee. The notices shall be mailed to the district manager of the Fox Metro Water Reclamation District as well as to all owners of record within two hundred fifty (250) feet in each direction of the location of the property in question. The owners of record within the two-hundred-fifty-foot requirement shall be determined by consulting the tax assessor's rolls of the township or county in which the property is located, provided the number of feet occupied by all public roads, streets, alleys and other public ways shall be excluded in computing the two-hundred-fifty-foot requirement. The notice shall be in writing and shall contain the following information: 
(1)  Common address of the property; 
(2)  Requested action; 
(3)  Date, time and place of hearing; 
(4)  Reference to engineering department of the city for further information; 
(5)  Telephone number of engineering department. 
The notice shall be mailed not more than twenty-one (21) days, nor less than seven (7) days in advance of such hearing. The notice shall be sent by first class mail, properly addressed as shown on the assessor's rolls and with sufficient postage affixed thereto. Proof of mailing certificates, as provided by the U.S. Postal Service, shall be submitted to the chairman of the planning and development committee at least three (3) days prior to the hearing date and shall be made part of the hearing record. A copy of the notice is to be sent to the city engineer. The applicant shall also file a sworn affidavit containing a complete list of the owners of record required to be served, the method of service, and names and addresses of the persons so served with copies of the notice. 
(c)  The following, while neither controlling nor fully measuring the city council's discretion, are deemed indicative of the criteria which may cause a variation request to be granted: 
(1)  The effect of the water runoff in question upon the overall runoff being introduced into the sewer system and, in particular, the effect of the runoff upon downstream users; 
(2)  The cost of repairs, as evidenced by no less than two (2) written contractor's estimates, in relation to the assessed value of the property in question; 
(3)  Previous city approval, either explicit or implicit, with regard to sanitary and/or stormwater runoff; and 
(4)  The length of time the applicant or his predecessors has relied upon the aforesaid city approval. 
(d)  The penalties for violations under this article shall be as provided in subsection 117.4 of section 12-17, as now or hereafter amended; and violating persons shall be subject to all other remedies or actions authorized by the building code as now or hereafter amended.

Secs. 48-143-48-150. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 4. - USER CHARGES 

Sec. 48-151. - User charges. 
(a)  For the purpose of this section, the terms "sanitary sewage" and "industrial wastes" are defined as follows: 
(1)  Sanitary sewage means waste from water closets, urinals, lavatories, sinks, bathtubs, showers, household laundries, floor drains, garage floor drains, bars, soda fountains, cuspidors, refrigerator drops and drinking fountains, etc. 
(2)  Industrial wastes means liquid waste resulting from any commercial, manufacturing or industrial operations or processes, etc. 
(b)  Rates and charges are established upon each lot, parcel of land, building or premises having any sewer connection with the sanitary sewerage system of the city, or which may otherwise discharge sewage or other industrial waste into such system of the city or any part thereof. Such charges and rates shall be based upon the quantity of water used thereon or therein as such quantity may be measured by the water meter serving such lot, parcel of land or premises. Such charges and rates for service shall be those as set forth in section 48-56 and section 48-57 of this Code, as amended. 
(c)  If any lot, parcel of land or premises which discharges sewage or industrial waste in the sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, obtains a part of the water used thereon from sources other than the city, and the water so obtained is not measured by a water meter, or is measured by a water meter which is not acceptable to the division of water meter reading and billing, then in such case the city shall permit the discharge of sewage or industrial waste into its sanitary sewage system only when the owner of such lot, parcel of land or premises, or some other interested party shall, at his expense, install and maintain a water meter which shall be satisfactory to the division. Such water meters shall be installed so as to measure all water received on such lot, parcel of land or premises, and the charges and rates shall be based upon the aggregate quantity of water received, as measured by all such meters. 
(d)  If (1) a lot, parcel of land or premises other than a single-family residence discharges sewage or industrial waste into the sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, and (2) the amount of water is such that the rate or charge will be in excess of the minimum monthly bill therefor, and (3) if it can be shown to the satisfaction of the division of water meter reading and billing that the portion of the water measured by the water or meters does not and cannot enter the sanitary sewage system, then the division may determine, in such manner and by such method as it may deem practicable, the percentage of the amount of water measured by the meter which enters the sanitary sewerage system. In such case the charges and rates shall be based upon the percentage of the metered water so determined. In the alternative in any such case, the division may require or permit the installation of other or additional meters in such a manner that the quantity of water which actually enters the sanitary sewerage system may be determined. In that case, the charges or rates shall be based upon the amount of water so shown actually to enter the sanitary sewerage system. 
    If a lot, parcel of land or premises is used only for single-family residence purposes, the department of public works is authorized to apply water quantities for winter quarters to sewer service charges for summer quarters in lieu of requiring separate metering or other documentation of water used for lawn watering and other purposes wherein water does not enter the sanitary sewer system. 
(e)  From and after August 1, 1972, application for the right to connect to the sewerage system of the city, including all improvements and extensions heretofore made or hereafter made thereto, shall be made in accordance with all existing ordinances and regulations of the city. 
(f)  From and after August 1, 1972, application for the right to connect any premises located outside the corporate limits of the city to the sewerage system of the city shall be made in accordance with all rules and regulations of the city. 
(g)  Bills for the charges and rates shall be made out by the division of water meter reading and billing. The time of making such bills and the period to be covered thereby shall be in accordance with the meter reading practices of the city for all lots, parcels of land and premises with respect to which such meter readings are used as a basis for the charges or rates. In all other cases, bills shall be made out quarterly. If the charges or rates for use of the sewerage system shall not be paid within ten (10) days after the date of any bill rendered therefor, a delayed payment charge in the amount of ten (10) percent of the bill rendered shall be imposed and collected. 
(h)  The city council shall, upon recommendation of the public works department, establish special rates for sewerage service furnished by the sewerage system of the city, not covered in the above-listed categories if any lot, parcel of land or premises has any sewer connection with the system. 
(i)  The owner of any lot, parcel of land or premises and the occupant thereof and the user of the sewerage service of the system shall be jointly and severally liable to pay for such service on such premises, and the services furnished to such premises by the city only upon the condition that the owner of the premises, occupant and user of the service are jointly and severally liable therefor to the city. If such charges and rates for sewerage services are not paid within thirty (30) days after rendition of the bill for such service, such charges shall be deemed and are declared to be delinquent and such delinquencies shall constitute liens upon the real estate for which such services were supplied, and the city clerk shall file sworn statements showing such delinquencies in the office of the recorder of deeds in the county wherein such premises are situated, and the filing of such statements shall be deemed notice for the payment of such charges and for such services. 
(j)  All revenues and moneys derived from the operation of the sewerage system shall be held by the city treasurer separate and apart from all other moneys that may come into his hands as city treasurer and shall be deposited in a separate bank account. Such revenue shall be used only for the purpose of paying the cost of operation, capital improvements and maintenance for the sewerage system, and paying the principal and interest on any bonds which may be issued by the city under state law and the ordinance enacted by the city under which any such bonds are issued. Such bonds shall be further governed by the terms of the ordinance or ordinances which shall authorize such bonds. 
(k)  The city treasurer shall receive all such revenues from the sewerage system and all other funds and moneys incident to the operation of the system and deposit them in a separate bank account, as hereinabove provided, and he shall install and maintain a proper system of accounts showing the amount of revenues received from the sewerage system and the application of the revenues, and such accounts shall be audited properly at least once a year. The keeping of such records and the audit thereof shall be further governed by the provisions of any ordinance which may heretofore or hereafter be adopted authorizing the issuance of bonds payable from the revenues of the sewerage system.

district as shown on the zoning map incorporated herein, the following
rules shall apply:
A. Where district boundary lines are indicated as following streets, alleys
or similar rights-of-way, they shall be construed as following the
centerlines thereof.
B. Where district boundary lines are indicated as approximately following
lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be such boundaries.
C. Where a lot held in one (1) ownership and of record at the effective
date of this ordinance is divided by a district boundary line, the entire
lot shall be construed to be within the less restricted district; provided
that this construction shall not apply if it increases the area of the less
restricted portion of the lot by more than twenty (20) percent.
3.2-11. General Provisions
3.2-11.1. Location of buildings.
A. Except as otherwise provided for in this ordinance, every building shall be
constructed or erected upon a lot, or parcel of land, which abuts upon a
public street or permanent easement of access to a public street, which
easement shall have a minimum width of twenty-five (25) feet, unless an
easement of lesser width was on record prior to the adoption of this
ordinance.
3.2-11.2. Buildings on a zoning lot.
A. Every building hereafter erected or structurally altered to provide
dwelling units, shall be located on a zoning lot as herein defined and in
no case, shall there be more than one (1) such building on one (1)
zoning lot, except that in a two-story garage with living quarters upon
the second floor such quarters may be occupied by a servant (and his
family) of the family occupying the main structure. There may also be
constructed a guest house (without kitchen) or rooms for guests within
an accessory building, provided such facilities are used for the
occasional housing of guests of the occupants of the main structure
and not for permanent occupancy by others as a housekeeping unit.
3.2-11.3. Rezoning of public and semipublic areas.
A. An area indicated on the zoning map as a public park, recreation area,
public school site, cemetery, or other similar open space, shall not be
used for any other purpose than that designated; and when the use of

planting season. An irrevocable Letter of Credit shall be required as
deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator to guarantee installation of
improvements required by the approved landscape plan prior to the
issuance of a permit. The amount of said Letter of Credit shall be based
on written bids from contractors covering the installation of all elements of
the landscape plan including but not limited to all planting material,
fencing, screen walls and pavers. Said Letter of Credit may be required
where there are extensive elements required by the approved landscape
plan as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
5.4-4.9. Timing extension for installation. If construction work is completed
during the off-planting season, with the City agreeing that plantings
installed at that time would likely die, then a temporary certificate of
occupancy shall be issued for the property which shall specify that all

or existing residential structure which has the same front
elevation or the same configuration of building materials or the same colors
facing the public street.
5.8. Nonconformity
5.8-1. Purpose and intent.
5.8-1.1. The Aurora Zoning Ordinance establishes separate districts, each of
which is an appropriate area for the location of the zoning lot
configurations, structures, and uses that are permitted in that district.
Nonconforming zoning lots, structures, and uses may be created when the
application of a specific zoning district to a property changes, or when a
zoning regulation otherwise changes. As a result of such changes, thenexisting
zoning lot configurations, structures, or uses may no longer be
allowed or are otherwise limited. It is necessary and consistent with the
establishment of those zoning districts that all zoning lot configurations,
structures, and uses that are nonconforming therewith be strictly regulated
and properly controlled.
It is the purpose of this section to provide for the regulation of
nonconforming zoning lots, structures, and uses in the various zoning
districts, recognizing that a zoning ordinance change is not enacted to
require all nonconforming situations to be immediately brought into
conformance, but rather to guide them and future zoning lot
configurations, structures, and uses in a new direction consistent with
current city policy. It is the intent of this section is to protect the character
of each zoning district by reducing the negative impacts from
nonconforming situations, to assure that revised zoning regulations will not
cause inappropriate or unnecessary burdens on individual property, and to
permit under limited conditions, but not encourage the survival of these
nonconformities by specifying those circumstances under which they shall
be allowed to continue.
5.8-2. Applicability.
5.8-2.1. The provisions of this section shall apply to all zoning districts when
any of the following circumstances exist:
O19-072 10/22/2019

area of the zoning district for the zoning lot.
B. Nonconforming structure. A structure that does not comply with the
zoning provisions then currently applicable to the zoning lot on which
said structure is located, or a structure originally designed for a use not
permitted within the zoning district for the zoning lot, with such
determination being made by the zoning administrator.
C. Nonconforming use. A use on a zoning lot that does not comply with
the zoning district provisions then currently applicable to the zoning lot
on which said use is located, including a use not allowed in the zoning
district for such zoning lot.
5.8-3. Continuance of a nonconforming zoning lot, structure, or use.
5.8-3.1. Any lawfully established zoning lot, structure, or use that existed prior
to the effective date of the Aurora Zoning Ordinance, or of applicable
amendments hereto and currently subject to one (1) or more of the
circumstances described in the Applicability subsection of this
Nonconformity Section, shall be deemed legal nonconforming and may be
continued subject to the provisions of this section.
5.8-4. Permitted changes to legal nonconforming zoning lots, structures and
uses.
5.8-4.1. Changes to legal nonconforming zoning lots, structures, and uses
permitted to continue pursuant to this section shall be permitted in
accordance with the following sections, with the most restrictive
subsection being enforced in case of multiple applicability. (Legal
nonconforming zoning lot and the structures thereon section contains the
least restrictive provisions, Legal nonconforming structure section contains
more restrictive provisions, and Legal nonconforming uses and the
structures related thereto section contains the most restrictive provisions.)
5.8-4.2. Legal nonconforming zoning lot and the structures thereon.

O19-072 10/22/2019
City of Aurora Zoning Ordinance 138
vitality and desirability and augment the housing quality of a
neighborhood, an administrative variance process will allow for the
construction of residential properties which may differ in scale, yet
meet or exceed the same design quality as determined by the Impact
Area. By virtue of a home being of a larger scale and magnitude than
the surrounding homes, these homes may have adverse effects of
restricting sunlight access, creating a sense of isolation from
neighborhood with a loss of backyard space and experiencing a loss of
open space, views and natural landscaping. The following standards
are in place to address the above stated adverse effects.
B. Variance requirements. An infill lot may be exempt from following
requirements of the Infill Housing Standards; (1) building width at the
structures public street elevation found under required design
elements, (2) garage material and style also found under required
design elements, and (3) stories section under Impact Area Design
standards; when the below stated requirements are met:
i. Lot requirements. The property on which the home is constructed
consists of two or more platted lots with right of way frontage which
shall be consolidated prior to construction. The consolidated lot
must have a minimum width of seventy-five (75) feet, a minimum
area of 10,000 square feet, and form a four square lot. Said lot
cannot be consolidated to leave less than two non-consolidated lots
on the block face between a public right of way and the subject lots.
ii. Exterior architecture. Primary and accessory dwelling units are to
be constructed of a minimum seventy-five percent (75%) brick or
stone masonry.
iii. Garage. All garages are to have a minimum three car capacity.
The style of the garage must be either side loading or detached. A
front loading attached garage is only permitted when over seventyfive
percent (75%) of the Impact Area is determined to have a front
loading garage style.
a. Design for front loading attached three car garage. If permitted
to have an attached front loading three car garage per the
above stated requirements, at least one of the garage entrances
must be set back five (5) feet from the remaining garage
entrances.
iv. Setbacks. Minimum rear setbacks shall be ten (10) feet greater
than required by the zoning districts.

days of registration, the city may proceed on its own to investigate
the complaint using the State of Illinois Standards described above.
ii. Odors. Odors from any use hereafter begun shall not be discernible
at the property line and shall not exceed the odor threshold
concentration. The measurement of the threshold odor shall be in

consistent with protection of residential uses, enhancement of the area's
image and physical appearance, maintenance of circulation safety, and
the assurance of compatibility with surroundings.
8.11-2.2. Intent. The Neighborhood Commercial District is intended to allow
existing commercial uses at a small scale and limited intensity of use
compatible with adjacent residential areas. The allowed uses in the district
are intended to accommodate basic convenience retail and service needs
of the immediate neighborhood, while limiting commercial activities to
those that have the least impact on nearby residences. The district limits
adverse effects on residential areas by excluding commercial activities
that generate heavy traffic or that involve heavy loading needs, by
controlling hours of operation, and by the application of standards to
accessory uses and other site features to mitigate adverse effects to the
maximum practical extent. The Neighborhood Commercial District is
intended to allow existing non-conforming land uses to come into
compliance under this District. These properties will require review of site
plans, traffic impact, parking, landscaping, and the maintenance of certain
land use functions whose operation are wholly within enclosed buildings or
which are otherwise totally screened from public view, and comply with all
the other provisions of this District.

Restrictions set forth in 8.11-5 et. seq. below. All building permits
must be in conformance with said site plan, as determined by the
Zoning Administrator. If the building permit is not in conformance, a
revised site plan review pursuant to the following provisions shall
be required prior to the building permit being issued.

plan is in substantial conformance to the standards below. The city
may reject a plan if any of the following standards are not met:
a. The development is in accordance with the comprehensive plan
and the physical development policies of the city.

properties and help to maintain and advance property values.
e. The proposed development beautifies parking lots through the
provision of landscape screens and islands.
f. The proposed development has taken measures to screen and

iii. Procedure. Site plans for all or specified phases shall be submitted
by the petitioner to the City Clerk with the City of Aurora's
application for site plan review. The City Council shall refer such
site plan review to the Aurora Planning Council. The Planning
Council shall review the site plan for conformance with the above
stated standards and all applicable City codes and ordinances. An
approval may be conditional and if so, shall specifically state what
additions or deletions from the site plan as submitted shall be made
in the site plan as approved. Such additions or deletions shall be
shown on or attached to such approved site plan. Upon the

processing of finished products without adversely affecting the health,
happiness, safety, convenience and welfare of the people living and
working in nearby areas.
9.1-1.5. To protect manufacturing districts from incompatible uses of land by
prohibiting the use of such space for new residential development, thereby
preserving the land for a more appropriate use in accordance with the
plans for city improvement and development.
9.1-1.6. To promote the most desirable use of land in accordance with a well
considered plan of land use for all of the city, to conserve the use of
property, to promote stability of manufacturing activities and related

upon the division of the city into districts, within which districts the use of land
and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation
to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are
uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly
classified in any particular district or districts without consideration, in each
case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public
need for the particular use at the particular location. Such special uses fall
into two (2) categories:
10.6-1.1. Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public interest;
O19-072 10/22/2019
City of Aurora Zoning Ordinance 247
10.6-1.2. Uses entirely private in character but of such an unusual nature that
their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their
impact upon neighboring property or public facilities.
10.6-2. Initiation of special uses. Any person owning or having an interest in the
subject property may file an application to use such land for one or more of
the special uses provided for in this ordinance in the zoning district in which
the land is situated.
10.6-3. Processing application for a special use.
10.6-3.1. Application for a special use. An application for a special use or
expansion or amendment to a special use shall be filed with the city clerk.
No application shall be accepted by the city clerk unless a preapplication
review has been completed with the planning director or said review has
been waived by the planning director. Such a preapplication review must
be arranged so that two (2) business days' notice is given to the planning
director prior to the date of the review. At such a preapplication review, the
planning director and prospective applicant shall review the following as
they relate to the proposed special use application:
A. General plan and physical development policies of the City of Aurora.
B. Existing zoning and land use in the general area of the property in
question.
C. The zoning history in the general area of the property in question.
D. The City of Aurora's special use review process.

use application may be filed with the City of Aurora. The application shall
include all plans and data as required within the City of Aurora's
application for a special use as approved by the Aurora city council.
Copies of such application shall be forwarded by the city clerk to the city
council to the planning council and planning commission with the request
that the planning commission hold a public hearing.
10.6-3.3. Notice of the public hearing shall be conducted pursuant to the
Amendments Section hereof.
10.6-4. Authorization. For each application for a special use, the plan
commission shall report to the city council its findings and recommendations,
including the stipulations of additional conditions and guarantees that such
conditions will be complied with when they are deemed necessary for the
protection of the public interest. The city council may grant or deny any
application for a special use, provided, however, that in the event of written
protest against any proposed special use, signed and acknowledged by the
owners of twenty (20) percent of the frontage adjacent thereto, or across an
alley, or directly opposite there from, such special use shall not be granted
O19-072 10/22/2019
City of Aurora Zoning Ordinance 248
except by the favorable vote of two-thirds of all the members of the city
council.
10.6-5. Standards. No special use shall be recommended by the plan
commission unless it shall make findings based upon Section 11.5-6 Findings
of Fact herein.
10.6-6. Planned developments. Planned developments are of such substantially
different character from other special uses that specific and separate
standards, exceptions, and procedures for approval are hereby established to
govern the recommendations of the plan commission and the action of the
city council.
10.6-6.1. The plan commission may recommend and the city council may
authorize that there be in part of the area of a planned development, and
for the duration of such development, specified uses not permitted by the
use regulations of the district in which said development is located,
provided that the plan commission shall find that:
A. The uses permitted by such exceptions are necessary or desirable and
are appropriate with respect to the primary purpose of the
development;
B. The uses permitted by such exception are not of such a nature or so
located as to exercise an undue detrimental influence on the
surrounding neighborhood;
C. Not more than twenty (20) percent of the ground area or of the gross
floor area of such development shall be devoted to the uses permitted
by said exception;
D. In an industrial planned development, such additional uses allowed by
exceptions shall conform with the performance standards of the district
in which the development is located;
E. The use exceptions so allowed are reflected by the appropriate zoning
district symbols and so recorded on the zoning district map.
10.6-6.2. Procedures for application for planned development.
A. The application for establishment of a planned development shall be
filed with the city clerk. No application shall be accepted by the city
clerk unless a preapplication review has been completed with the
planning director or said review has been waived by the planning
director. The preapplication review must be arranged so that forty-eight
(48) hours' notice is given to the planning director prior to the date of
the review. At the preapplication review, the planning director and
prospective applicant shall review the following as they relate to the
proposed application for establishment of a planned development:

iv. The City of Aurora's process for establishment of a planned
development.
v. Other pertinent factors.

application for establishment of a planned development may be filed
with the City of Aurora. The application shall include all plans and data
as required within the City of Aurora's application for establishment of a
planned development as approved by the Aurora city council. Copies
of the application shall be forwarded by the city clerk to the city council
to the planning commission with the request to hold a public hearing.
C. The application for establishment of a planned development shall be
accompanied by a preliminary plan or both a preliminary plan and final
plan for all or a portion of the planned development. The plan(s) must
include all data as specified in the City of Aurora's application for

10.6-6.3. Bulk regulations. The plan commission may recommend and the city
council may authorize that there be in a planned development, exceptions
to the bulk regulations set forth herein the district regulations applicable to
the district in which the planned development is located, provided that the
plan commission shall find:
A. That such exception shall be solely for the purpose of promoting a
unified site plan no less beneficial to the residents or occupants of
such development as well as the neighboring property than would be
obtained by the bulk regulations of this ordinance for buildings
developed on separate lots;
B. That the overall floor area ratio, when applicable, would not exceed by
more than fifteen (15) percent the floor area ratio regulations of this
ordinance for the district in which it is located;
C. That in the part of the planned development containing only residential
uses, the minimum lot area per dwelling unit may be less than required
by the district regulations applicable to the district regulations
applicable to the district in which the planned development is located,
but not more than fifteen (15) percent, provided there is contained
within the planned development permanent open spaces, the area and
location of which shall meet with the approval of the zoning hearings
commission, and that such open space shall not be less than that
which would pertain if developed on individual lots.
D. Such open areas shall be preserved over the life of the planned
development, for use only by the planned development or dedicated to
the City of Aurora for school, park, playground or other public uses;
and
E. That in part of a planned development devoted to residential uses, the
plan commission may recommend and the city council may approve,
access to a dwelling by a driveway or pedestrian walk easement, and
spacing between buildings of lesser widths or depths then required by
district regulations for the district in which the planned development is
located, provided:
i. That adequate provisions are made which perpetuate during the
period of the special use, access easements and off-street parking
spaces for use by the residents of the dwelling served;
ii. The spacing between buildings shall be approved by the plan
commission and shall be consistent with the application of
recognized site planning principles for securing a unified
development and due consideration is given to the openness
normally afforded by intervening streets and alleys. Spacing
between principal buildings within a part of a planned development
where subsequent transfer of ownership is contemplated, shall be
O19-072 10/22/2019
City of Aurora Zoning Ordinance 251
equivalent to such spacing as would be required between buildings
by district regulations for the district in which it is located; and
F. The yards for principal buildings along the periphery of the
development shall be not less in width or depth than required for
permitted uses in the district regulations applicable to the district in
which the planned development is located, and the plan is developed
to afford adequate protection to neighboring properties.
10.6-7. Conditions and guarantees. Prior to granting any special use, the plan
commission may recommend, and the city council shall stipulate such
conditions and restrictions upon the establishment, locations, construction,
maintenance and operation of the special use as deemed necessary for the
protection of the public interest and to secure compliance with the standards
and requirements specified herein, as may be from time to time required. In
all cases in which special uses are granted, the city council shall require such
evidence and guarantees as it may deem necessary as proof that the
conditions stipulated in connection therewith are being, and will be, complied
with.
10.6-7.1. As part of such evidence and guarantees, before any building permit
is issued for any work associated with a special use permit, the property
owner or developer shall post an irrevocable letter of credit with the City of
Aurora's Division of Inspection and Permits to guarantee required
installation of improvements mandated by the special use permit such as
landscaping, fencing, screen walls, and paving. The actual amount of the
letter of credit shall be determined by the owner or developer, based upon
written bids from contractors and subject to the approval of the zoning
administrator. The city may impose the above letter of credit restriction in
planned developments, where appropriate.
A. Violation of conditions. In cases where conditions and restrictions are
stipulated by special use ordinance upon the establishment, location,
construction, maintenance and operation of the use as deemed
necessary for the protections and securings herein described, and are
not followed, the city council shall have the authority to revoke the
special use.
10.6-7.2. In order to revoke the special use, the city council planning and
development committee shall conduct a public meeting at which time the
parties granted the special use, after service of a ten (10) day written
notice, may explain their reasons for not adhering to the required
conditions and restrictions. Such committee may then grant additional time
for compliance, based upon sufficient cause, or may recommend to the
city council that the special use be revoked. The decision by said
committee to revoke the special use shall become a recommendation to
the full city council. The special use shall be revoked by ordinance.
10.6-8. Effect of denial of a special use. No application for a special use which
has been denied wholly or in part by the council shall be resubmitted for a
O19-072 10/22/2019
City of Aurora Zoning Ordinance 252
period of one (1) year from the date of said order of denial, except on the
grounds of substantial new evidence or proof of changed conditions found to
be valid by the plan commission and the city council.
10.6-9. Termination of special use permit. If construction work such as parking
lots, sidewalks, streets, buildings, sewer and water lines on the proposed
development, have not begun within twelve (12) months from the
authorization order of the city council, the city council shall have the power to
institute proceedings on its own motion to terminate the special use permit.

City of Aurora Zoning Ordinance 254
10.7. Planned development districts.
10.7-1. Purpose. A large planned development which includes multiple principal
uses that would require classification of the property within the planned
development into two (2) or more standard zoning districts presents to both
the city and the owner or developer difficult planning problems if it may be
approved only as a special use pursuant to this section, and the purpose of
this section is to provide for the approval and classification of such planned
developments as separate zoning districts under this ordinance.
10.7-2. Definition and size limitation. A planned development district is a tract of
land which includes two (2) or more principal uses that would require
classification of the tract into two (2) or more standard zoning districts and
which is developed as a unit under single ownership or under single, unified
or coordinated control of its planning and development. A planned
development district must include at least two hundred (200) acres of
contiguous property; provided that after establishment of a planned
development district in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
section, contiguous property of any size may be added to such district; and,
provided further, that properties separated by highways, streets, public ways
or railroads or other public utility rights-of-way may be deemed contiguous for
the purpose of qualifying as a planned development district. All procedures
required by this section for the establishment of a planned development
district shall be applicable to the addition of property to an existing planned
development district, and any provision of this section or of any other
ordinance of the City of Aurora which refers to the establishment of a planned
development district shall, with respect to such added property, be deemed to
refer to the adoption by the city council of the zoning amendment adding such
property to a planned development district.
10.7-3. Preapplication review. An application for the establishment of a planned
development district shall be filed with the city clerk. No application shall be
accepted by the city clerk unless a preapplication review has been completed
with the planning director or said review has been waived by the planning
director. Such a preapplication review must be arranged so that forty-eight
(48) hours' notice is given to the planning director prior to the date of the
review. At such a preapplication review, the planning director and prospective
applicant shall review the following as they relate to the proposed application
for establishment of a planned development district:
A. General plan and physical development policies of the City of Aurora.
B. Existing zoning and land use in the general area of the property in
question.
C. The zoning history in the general area of the property in question.
D. The City of Aurora's planned development district review process.
E. Other pertinent factors.

planned development district may be established only by amendment of the
zoning map in accordance with the amendment procedures set forth in the
Amendments Section of this ordinance and by compliance with the provisions
of this section. Application for the establishment of a planned development
district may be made by the developer by filing with the city clerk an
application for a zoning amendment establishing a planned development
district. Said application shall be accompanied by a plan description which
application and plan description shall be deemed to comply with the
requirements of the Amendment Section for a zoning amendment application
and the plans, data and other information and evidence that must accompany
such application. Said plan description shall include the following:

planned development district including: (i) a description of all land uses to
be included in such district (including open space) with approximate
percentages or, alternatively, maximum or minimum percentage limitations
for each use, (ii) projected densities for residential uses or, alternatively,
maximum and minimum limitations for such densities and (iii) a description
of the development standards and design criteria applicable to the
proposed planned development district. Such written explanation may set
forth the delimitating factors that the developer shall be permitted to use in
locating the proposed land uses to be included in the district.
10.7-4.4. A plat or map of the proposed planned development district which
shall show its relation to existing roads and highways, traffic circulation
features adjacent to the proposed district, existing zoning of the proposed
district and adjacent properties and a generalized plan of existing utilities
which will serve the proposed district.
10.7-4.5. A topographical survey of the proposed planned development
district at five-foot contour intervals, which may be taken from U.S.G.S.
information, showing the limits of the highest recorded flood if available
from public documents.
10.7-4.6. The existing limits of floodplain in the proposed planned
development district if such limits have been mapped by the Northeastern
Illinois Planning Commission or another public agency. If such floodplain
O19-072 10/22/2019
City of Aurora Zoning Ordinance 256
limits have not been mapped by any public body, the developer shall
supply floodplain limits prepared by engineers approved by the city.
10.7-4.7. A description of the modifications, exceptions, and variations from
this ordinance or the city subdivision control ordinance which are being
requested as part of the application for establishment of the planned
development district.

Section, and within the time period provided for in the Amendment Section
but in no event later than ninety (90) days after the date on which the
application was forwarded by the city council, unless the developer and
the plan commission have agreed to an extension of such time period, the
plan commission shall submit to the city council its recommendation with
respect to the application. The plan commission may recommend that the
city council approve or disapprove the application. In either case, the plan
commission shall set forth the reasons for its recommendation, and may,
in the event of a favorable recommendation, specify particular conditions
which should be incorporated in an approval of the application.
Within sixty (60) days after receipt of the plan commission's
recommendation, the city council shall either approve or disapprove the
application. An approval may be conditional and if so shall specifically
state what additions or deletions from the plan description as submitted
shall be made in the application as approved.
10.7-5. Zoning amendment. Upon approval of the application for establishment of
a planned development district by the city council and acceptance by the
developer of any conditions incorporated in such approval, the city council
shall proceed to amend the zoning map by rezoning the property as a
planned development district. The public hearing on the application previously
held by the plan commission pursuant to the amendment procedure provided
for in the Amendment Section of this ordinance shall satisfy all hearing
requirements for the rezoning action.
10.7-6. Preliminary plans.
10.7-6.1. Within such time periods as are prescribed in this section,
preliminary plans for all or specified development phases of the planned
development district shall be submitted for approval in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this section. Approval of preliminary plans may
not be withheld for reasons that would be inconsistent with the approved
plan description. Preliminary plans may contain reasonable variations from
the approved plan description, and subject to such conditions as may be
O19-072 10/22/2019
City of Aurora Zoning Ordinance 257
made a part of the approval of the plan description, a variation shall be
deemed reasonable provided it does not (a) increase the gross residential
density by more than five (5) percent; (b) reduce the area set aside for
common open space by more than five (5) percent; or (c) increase or
decrease by more than ten (10) percent the bulk restrictions on buildings
and structures. In approving a preliminary plan, the city council may,
without further public hearing, also approve changes from the plan
description which exceed the scope of permitted reasonable variations,
provided that no such change is a "major change" as defined in this
section, below.
10.7-6.2. Major changes from the plan description shall not be made without
consideration of such changes at a public hearing held in accordance with
the provisions of the Amendment Section as in the case of an application
for establishment of a planned development district. A major change shall
be a change which substantially alters the proposed uses (including open
space) or the percentages or the maximum or minimum percentage
limitations for each use, projected densities for residential uses or the
maximum or minimum limitations for such densities, or the intent and
purpose of the plan description.
10.7-7. Requirements for preliminary plans. A preliminary plan shall include or be
accompanied by the following:

10.7-8. Time limitations for submission of preliminary plans. A preliminary plan
for not less than forty (40) acres of the proposed planned development district
(first preliminary plan) shall be submitted for approval within twelve (12)
months after adoption by the city council of the amendment establishing the
planned development district; provided that upon request in writing of the
developer, the city council may at any time or from time to time, by resolution
duly adopted at any meeting of the city council, extend the period of time for

and providing flexibility within, existing zoning classifications for those areas
of the city with unique land use and environmental characteristics that may
not be adequately addressed under any of the zoning district classifications
having theretofore been adopted by the city. Further, it is the intent of the city
in establishing overlay districts:
10.8-1.1. To provide specific zoning protection, which includes development
standards and design guidelines, for areas which are nonconforming due
to their having been constructed prior to the establishment of the current
zoning district classification, yet are in accordance with the City's
Comprehensive Plan and Physical Development Policies; and
10.8-1.2. To provide zoning protection, which includes development
standards and design guidelines, for parcels of land with various zoning
district classifications which may be developed as one unified
development; and
O19-072 10/22/2019
City of Aurora Zoning Ordinance 264

standards and design guidelines, for contiguous parcels of land having
similar uses which require special planning considerations due to their
location adjacent to a unique geographic feature, major arterial roadway,
incompatible land use and/or other external influencing factors; and
10.8-1.4. To provide zoning protection, which includes development
standards and design guidelines, for areas with unique architectural
features and/or site planning considerations; and
10.8-1.5. To provide zoning protection, which includes development
standards and design guidelines, for areas where there is potential for
major public/private financial investment requiring clear policy and
planning direction to maximize public benefit and private return from such
investment.
10.8-2. Definition and rules. An overlay district shall be defined as an ordinance
calling for the establishment of certain zoning protection, which includes
development standards and design guidelines, over a specified area within
the city's jurisdiction, and which shall be based upon a city approved
conceptual design, setting forth certain goals and objectives for the district.
