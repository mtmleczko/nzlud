PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Conway, Arkansas. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code was the 1975 Code, as supplemented through February, 2016, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1975 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of Codes of Ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

(Index or Indexes) 
    The (index or indexes) (has or have) been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the (index itself or indexes themselves) which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

D.  Injury. As used herein "injury" shall include, but shall not be limited to, all accidental bodily injuries of whatever kind or nature, which an employee may sustain, while within or without the course of his employment, which incapacitates said employee to such a degree that he is no longer able to perform the ordinary duties required of him by his employment. 
E.  Emergency Leave. Emergency leave shall be a period of time off from an employee's regular employment, in addition to annual leave and sick leave, which an employee may be granted when, in the sound discretion of his supervisor or department head, an emergency is deemed to exist of such a nature as to require the employee to be absent from his employment. 
F.  Holidays. All employees other than firemen and policemen, who receive equalization pay of the city, shall observe the hereinafter set forth holidays, and unless an exemption is granted to their respective department, by the mayor on the request of the department director:

(Ord. No. O-76-35, Secs. 1, 2) 
2.32.03 - Annual leave. 
A.  No employee shall be eligible to take annual leave unless and until he shall have been continuously employed for a term of one (1) year by that department of the city by which he is employed and he shall then be entitled to annual leave for a term which shall be computed as follows: For each full calendar month such employee shall have been continuously employed during the preceding calendar year he shall be entitled to one-twelfth of the full annual leave for members of the department by which such employee is employed. 
B.  Each calendar year each person who shall have been an employee of the public works department or the sanitation department of the city for and during the full calendar year last past shall be entitled to annual leave with pay for a term equal to ten (10) working days during the calendar year. 
C.  Each calendar year the clerk/treasurer of the city, the city inspector, the District Court clerk, each person who shall have been an employee of the fire department or the police department of the city for and during the full calendar year last past shall be entitled to annual leave with pay for a term of two (2) calendar weeks. 
D.  Any employee desiring to take his annual leave shall submit his written request therefore to the superintendent or chief officer of the department of which he is an employee, using appropriate forms prescribed therefore. The time or times of vacations for all employees of any department shall be determined by the superintendent or chief officer thereof, having due regard for the needs of the department and the welfare of the employees. Except in cases of emergency, the approval of annual leave will be obtained in advance of the absence. In emergency situations the employee must notify his department head of the emergency within a reasonable time after the beginning of his regularly assigned shift on the first day of absence and request leave. All requests for annual leave shall specify the length of time desired, except in emergency situations where circumstances do not permit. The supervisor or department head shall advise the employee whether his request for leave is approved or denied. Employees will be encouraged to request a continuous period of at least one (1) week annual leave each year for vacation purposes. Short periods of leave will also be granted for attending to personal business, which shall be counted as part of the annual leave time of that employee. 
E.  In order that all employees shall be given the opportunity for a reasonable vacation period and to permit them to use all annual leave they might otherwise forfeit, each department head shall establish for his department a leave schedule for the entire leave year. Leave will be scheduled to avoid having an excessive number of employees on leave at the same time and to insure that a sufficient number of personnel will be on duty to maintain essential operations. Leave schedules shall be flexible so as to allow for leave for emergency situations which may occur, and when changes are made in a leave schedule the changes must be based on factors that are reasonable and equitable for all persons concerned. Short periods of leave taken for personal business or unforeseen emergencies may be substituted for corresponding periods of scheduled leave. 
F.  Each department head may require the employees of his department to take annual leave at times as may be required by the needs of the department. Such required use of annual leave will be based upon factors that are reasonable, equitable, and do not discriminate among employees. Circumstances within the contemplation of this provision are, for example, times when an employee's services cannot be utilized fully because of a breakdown of equipment, repair of machinery, inventory, fire, adverse weather conditions preventing satisfactory utilization of the employees time or work, or similar conditions. In all cases where employees are required to take leave the department head shall make proper notation thereon upon the employee's employment records. 
G.  If any employee shall fail to take the full annual leave granted to him in any calendar year he may carry the unused portion thereof forward into the next succeeding calendar year, but in no instance shall an employee be permitted to carry forward more than fifty percent (50%) of his annual leave for the year just ended. In the event any employee shall carry a portion of his annual leave forward into the next succeeding calendar year he must take such carried over annual leave during the first six (6) months of said succeeding year or he shall lose the same. It shall be mandatory that each employee shall take fifty percent (50%) of his annual vacation each calendar year, to be taken in one (1) continuous term. Upon the termination of employment of any employee the earned annual leave of that employee which shall not have been taken may then be taken. 
(Ord. No. A-474, Sec. 3 as amended by Ord. No. O-78-6, Sec. 1) 
2.32.04 - Sick leave. 
A.  Sick leave will be granted to employees when they are incapacitated for the performance of their duties by sickness, injury, or pregnancy, and confinement for medical, dental, or optical examination or treatment, or when a member of the immediate family of the employee is afflicted with a contagious disease which is ruled subject to quarantine by local health authorities. All employees of the city shall be entitled to sick leave with full pay. Sick leave shall annually accrue at the rate of one-half day for each month of continuous employment by the same department during each calendar year, plus one (1) day for each year of continuous employment in excess of six (6) years. 
B.  If an employee shall fail to take or utilize all of the sick leave to which he is entitled in any calendar year he may carry forward the unused portion thereof until he shall have accumulated a maximum of sixty (60) days. All accumulated and unused sick leave of an employee shall be forfeited upon termination of the employment of that employee, unless he shall present to his department head the certificate of a duly licensed and practicing physician attesting that such employee is in fact ill or injured to the extent that he was, at the time of such termination, prevented from being gainfully employed, and it shall be the duty of such terminated employee to have an examination made of himself, at his sole expense, by the physician who is on the board of trustees of the pension and relief fund for the department by which said employee was employed at least one (1) time each seven (7) days for the time during which said employee is being paid for accumulated sick leave stating that such employee continues to be ill or injured to the extent that he is prevented from being gainfully employed. 
C.  Any absence from work in excess of one (1) day due to an alleged sickness or injury shall be denied as sick leave unless the employee shall present to the head of the department the certificate of a duly licensed and practicing physician, attesting to such illness or injury. A medical certificate will not ordinarily be required for absences of less than one (1) day. However, an employee who is absent frequently for short periods because of illness may be advised to obtain a physical check up from a qualified physician. When there is reason to believe that an employee is abusing the use of sick leave, a medical certificate may be required for absences of less than one (1) day. 
D.  Sick leave is a qualified right of the employees to be used only in accordance with announced policies and instructions. It is within the discretion of the department head to ascertain whether the reason for absence justifies approval of the request for sick leave. When an employee is unable to report for work because of an incapacitating illness he will notify his department head within two (2) hours after the beginning of the assigned shift on the first day of absence. Such notification may be made by telephone, word of another employee, or by any means available. Notification shall include nature and extent of illness, expected time of return to duty, and address during the period of absence. It shall be the duty of the employee to keep his department head informed of the extent of his illness and the time of his expected return to duty, and failure to do so may result in a charge of absence from work without leave. 
E.  Application for sick leave of more than one (1) day shall be made upon the form provided therefore within two (2) days after return to duty. Sick leave of more than one (1) day must be supported by a statement by a registered and practicing physician that the employee was incapacitated to perform his usual duties and must cover all absences beyond the first day. In some instances where employees are not attended by a physician, a statement by the employee certifying that he was incapacitated for duty may be accepted in lieu of a medical certificate, but such statement must be filed within two (2) days after return to duty. Unjustified leave may be changed to annual leave or absence without leave, and, when appropriate, disciplinary action may be taken. 
F.  Sick leave may be granted to an employee who, because of illness or injury, is unable to return to work following a period of non-pay status. 
G.  Employees on extended leave (including sick leave for maternity reasons) at the time advance notice of reduction in force or displacement is received may be continued on sick leave for the duration of the illness, not in excess of the extent of the notice period. Sick leave may not be substituted for annual leave after the last day in a duty status. 
H.  Sick leave may not be granted retroactively to cover any period of absence without pay which has been applied for and approved in advance. Advance sick leave may be granted retroactively within administrative discretion except as specifically prohibited above. 
I.  If an employee sustains an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of his employment which results in the temporary total disability of such employee he may be paid his full salary or wage for a term not exceeding three (3) months, upon presentation of the certificate of a duly licensed and practicing physician that such injury has resulted in the total temporary disability of said employee. Provided, however, it shall be the duty of such employee, at his sole expense, to have an examination made of himself at least once each thirty (30) days by a duly licensed and practicing physician and if he shall have recovered from such disability it shall be the duty of the head of the department employing such employee to stop payment of such salary or wage as a disability and to place said employee back in service, and the time of his disability shall be considered as continuous service in his position. It is specifically provided that the within provision is intended to be and shall be in addition to and not in lieu of or in substitution for the provisions for retirement for temporary total disability as may now or hereafter be provided in any Pension and Relief Act or ordinance now or hereafter enacted by or effective in the city, but it is intended that an employee so injured shall be specifically prohibited from obtaining payment of wages, salary or benefits under both this ordinance and any Pension and Relief Act or ordinance for the same injury, and to that end and extent the two (2) enactments shall be mutually exclusive. 
(Ord. No. A-474, Sec. 4) 
2.32.05 - Brief periods of absence and tardiness. 
    Unavoidable or necessary absence from duty and tardiness for less than one (1) hour, may be excused for adequate reason by the employee's department head. If this privilege is abused such absence will be charged to the employee's annual leave or disciplinary action may be taken. If the absence is charged to annual leave the charge shall be made in multiples of one (1) hour. If the leave charge exceeds the period of absence or tardiness the employee will not be required to work during the additional period covered by leave.

    The ambulance authority shall follow the following as minimum standards: 
A.  Equipment and management capability. Each and every ambulance and all onboard equipment utilized by the authority in performing services which are the subject of this chapter shall comply with applicable standards required for licensure. The authority shall maintain the equipment and shall employ sufficient backup equipment to ensure that a safe level of reserve equipment capacity is available to provide peak period ambulance coverage even at times when unusual occurrences of equipment breakdown and routine equipment maintenance coincide. 
B.  Personnel. The authority shall ensure: 
1.  That two (2) persons certified under state law are on board each ambulance on ALS (Code 1 or 2) ambulance runs or available for dispatch, at least one (1) of which is certified as a paramedic, and the other of which is certified as a paramedic or emergency medical technician (EMT). 
2.  If only one (1) person on board is a certified paramedic, that person shall not function as the driver while the patient is on board. Every BLS ambulance subject to regulation under this article is required to have on board two (2) EMT's, one (1) to drive and the other to attend. The authority shall establish and maintain sufficient management capability to ensure that equipment and personnel utilized are managed in an efficient and effective manner to produce the desired clinical performance and response time performance on a routine basis. 
C.  Clinical performance. The clinical performance of the authority and its personnel shall be consistent with and shall conform to the operating procedures and medical protocols adopted by the AEPF, Inc., where clinical performance deficiencies are discovered, the authority shall demonstrate an aggressive and effective manner to correct the deficiencies in a timely manner. 
D.  Response time performance. 
1.  Code 1 calls (life threatening emergencies). 
a.  The Fire Department shall furnish a diligent good faith effort to manage all available resources to achieve a four-minute maximum response time for a trained first responder to a Code 1. 
b.  The authority shall furnish a diligent good faith effort to maintain an eight-minute (8:59) maximum response time for an advanced life support paramedic ambulance. The authority shall employ enough personnel, acquire enough equipment and manage its resources in the manner necessary to meet the eight-minute response time standard on not less than ninety percent (90%) of all presumptively designated Code 1 calls originating each month from within the city limits. 
c.  Where an ambulance unit is dispatched from a non-transporting first-response-only status its response time may be counted as the authority ambulance response time even though the patient was transported by a different ambulance. In addition, the response time of a neighboring ambulance service responding by mutual aid request may also be counted as the authority's ambulance response time, provided the level of life support capability furnished by the neighboring ambulance service is comparable to that required under this article, as determined by the AEPF, Inc., and provided that reliance upon neighboring ambulance service operators is only an occasional event and not a routine method of operation of the authority. 
2.  Code 2 calls (non-life threatening emergencies). The authority shall establish a twelve-minute (12:59) advanced life support paramedic ambulance response time standard for Code 2 calls on not less than two (2) calls originating each month from within the city limits. 
3.  Other run codes (non-life threatening). The authority's response to other run codes shall be reasonable, but in every case where a conflicting demand for resources occurs, response to Code 1 and Code 2 Calls shall take precedence over requests for other service requests. Furthermore, the authority shall display sound judgment in developing its system status management plans to preserve a safe level of emergency response capability at all times by delaying units become available whenever the service until additional ambulance units become available whenever the number of remaining ambulance units available for dispatch falls below a reasonably established safe level of emergency reserve capacity, as determined by historical demand analyses. 
4.  Retrospective designation. For purposes of this subsection, the designation of a run as Code 1, Code 2, or other shall be made by the authority's system status management personnel at the point of dispatch on a presumptive basis and no retrospective alteration of such designation shall be allowed. However, runs originally designated as Code 2, or other may be retrospectively re-designated upward by the executive director, if the executive director disputes the original designation, and the authority board requests a determination from the AEPF who then reviews and determines that the original designation was improper, given the information available to the EMS control center personnel at the time of the presumptive designation of the run code type. 
5.  Exempt calls. Certain types of calls may be excluded as specified by the medical director and the executive director on a standard from signed by both. Such records are maintained in the office of the operations manager. 
6.  Community response time. In addition to the response time performance standard required under this section for Run Code 1 and Run Code 2 calls, the authority shall furnish and manage its resources in the many necessary to provide reliable emergency and non-emergency ambulance service throughout the entire city and shall perform its system status management and system status planning operations so as to minimize the differences in the respective average emergency-response-time performances among the various ambulance districts of the city to the greatest practical extent. In addition, the authority shall take such steps as necessary to reduce or eliminate any continuing pattern of apparent discrimination in the average response time performance to any given ambulance district or portion thereof. 
E.  Continuous physician medical control required. The authority shall be responsible for ensuring that its field personnel at all times have access to qualified medical control and direction concerning the care of patients in the field by a base station physician or nurse. All medical control and direction shall be available by reliable radio communications, according to the communications standards and other standards of medical control set forth herein. 
F.  Data systems and reporting. The ambulance authority shall comply at all times with the data system and reporting standards required by the AEPF, Inc., and applicable statutes. 
G.  In-service training program required. The authority is required to furnish or otherwise make available without charge to this employees an in-service training program which conforms to the standards for in-service training adopted by the AEPF, Inc., all ambulance personnel are required to attend these in-service training programs in accordance with the guidelines promulgated by the AEPF, Inc. 
H.  Fully centralized dispatch required. All dispatching movements of ambulance units subject to regulation under this chapter shall be directed from the designated EMS control center. It is unlawful to dispatch or control any ambulance unit subject to regulation under this chapter from any location other than the designated EMS control center.

The notice of dangerous dog designation shall also inform the dog's owner, keeper or harborer that a hearing to contest the designation shall be held before the Chief of Police of the Conway Police Department, or their appointed designee, if a written request for a hearing is received by the Director of the Animal Welfare Unit within seven (7) working days of the mailing of the notice of dangerous dog designation, or before title to the animal is transferred to the Animal Welfare Unit pursuant to this Section, whichever occurs first. 
4.  Status pending hearing. Once notice of a dangerous dog designation has been given, the dog so designated shall be considered a dangerous dog for purposes of this Section unless and until such time as that designation is overruled by the Chief of Police of the Conway Police Department or their appointed designee. 
5.  Hearing. Hearings required pursuant to this Section shall be held no more than seven (7) working days from the date of receipt of the request. The Chief of Police of the Conway Police Department, or their appointed designee, shall act as the appeal hearing officer and shall make their ruling on the basis of a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing. The hearing shall be an informal proceeding, and each party shall have the right to call and examine witnesses, to introduce exhibits, to cross-examine opposing witnesses on any matter relevant to the issues even though that matter was not covered in the direct examination, to impeach any witness regardless of which party first called the witness to testify, and to rebut the evidence against the party. Either party may call the owner/custodian as a witness. The decision of the hearing officer regarding a dangerous dog designation shall be final. 
6.  Compliance. If the person owning, keeping, possessing or otherwise maintaining a dog designated a dangerous dog fails to request a hearing within the time allowed, or if the Chief of Police of the Conway Police Department, or their designee, determines that the dangerous dog designation shall stand, the owner or custodian shall comply with all requirements of this section for the keeping of dangerous dogs within the City limits. 
D.  Requirements generally. Every person who owns, keeps or harbors a dangerous dog within the corporate limits of the City shall at all times comply with the following requirements:

7.36.01 - Purpose. 
    The City of Conway, Arkansas, has determined a problem exists within the City of Conway with false alarms from systems that are not installed, maintained or operated properly. This problem has resulted in increased service calls by the Conway emergency services creating a hazard to the members of those departments and to the general public. Therefore, it is the City Council's purpose to require alarm users, installers and monitors to properly maintain operational effectiveness of alarm systems in order to improve reliability of alarm systems and reduce or eliminate false alarms. 
    This chapter governs alarm systems intended to summon emergency services, requires a permit for alarm systems, provides penalties for violations, and sets conditions to appeal the imposition of charges for violations.

7.36.02 - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases when used in this chapter shall have meanings ascribed to them in this section except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Alarm system means any device or series of devices arranged, designed, or used to transmit or emit a signal indicating the occurrence of a criminal offense, fire emergency, or medical emergency and intended to summon, either directly or through a third party, emergency services response. Alarm system does not include an alarm installed on or in a vehicle. Alarms in separate structures are to be counted as separate systems even though owned by the same person(s) or entity. 
    Alarm user means any person responsible for the location where the alarm is installed. 
    Dispatch means the process by which the 9-1-1 communication center instructs the appropriate emergency services to respond to an alarm. 
    False alarm means the activation of any alarm system eliciting a response by emergency services to a nonemergency situation. Alarms resulting from the following conditions are not considered false alarms for purposes of this section: 
A.  Criminal activity or unauthorized entry; 
B.  Telephone line malfunction verified in writing to the City by at least a first-line telephone company supervisor;

F.  Any activation caused by violent conditions of nature or other extraordinary circumstances, not reasonably subject to control of the alarm user. 
    Response by Emergency Services means the instant any branch of emergency services is informed of an alarm activation through dispatch. 
(Ord. No. O-16-45 , § 1, 4-26-2016)

Any alarm business or company which installs or maintains alarm systems in a dwelling, business, or place within the City of Conway which has not been granted a permit shall be fined the sum of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per occurrence. 
B.  The alarm system application must be filled out completely to be considered. Updates shall be made as necessary. Upon approval and issuance of the alarm system permit, a copy shall be sent to the Conway Police Department prior to activation of the alarm. 
C.  Verified Response: Prior to reporting an alarm to the Conway Police Department, the Monitoring Company or its representative will attempt to contact the alarm site or alarm user or other responsible party listed in the permit application by telephone or other electronic means, to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting an emergency services response in an attempt to avoid a false alarm. If dispatch is necessary, once notified either by emergency services or the monitoring company, it is the obligation of the alarm user to meet emergency services personnel at the alarm site to secure said building and to reset the alarm. 
D.  Should alarm user, when notified of its activation, refuse or fail to respond pursuant to subsection C hereof, the police units on the scene shall check the property thoroughly and secure the location as much as possible. The Conway Police Department shall not be required to make any further responses to that building, dwelling, or place until such time as said alarm system has been properly checked and reset. 
E.  If an alarm is activated and the building appears to have been entered unlawfully, and the owner or his designee cannot be located or will not come to the location, the Conway Police Department may choose to either attempt to secure the location or contact an off-duty police officer to guard the premises until the next business day or until the owner or his designee shall respond whichever comes first.

The hearing must be requested in writing by certified mail to chief of police and/or the fire chief within seven (7) days after the mailing of the statement for false alarm fees.

    It shall be unlawful for any person to place, deposit, or permit to be deposited in any unsanitary manner on public or private property within corporate limits of the City of Conway, or in any area under the jurisdiction of said City, any human or animal excrement, garbage, or other objectionable waste, except where suitable treatment has been provided in accordance with subsequent provisions of this ordinance. The issuance of a valid National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit covering such discharges into a natural outlet shall be considered as meeting all requirements of this section. Hereafter no wastewater and/or toilet facilities shall be constructed or placed in, upon or about any real property situated within the City of Conway, Arkansas, or in any area under the jurisdiction of said City, unless such facilities shall be properly connected with a publicly owned or operated wastewater disposal system or a privately owned or operated wastewater disposal system which is connected with a public system. Any person, firm or corporation desiring to construct, place or install any wastewater and/or toilet facilities within any structure to be constructed upon any lands within the City of Conway shall, prior to commencing work thereon, submit proper application therefore to the City Inspector in the form and manner now or hereafter provided by ordinances of said City, and shall pay the fees therefore. If the proposed facilities meet the specifications and requirements of the Plumbing Code then in existence in said City, and any portion of the lands upon which such facilities are to be constructed and installed is within three hundred (300) ft. of any public sewer system or any private sewer line which is connected with a public sewer system, said Inspector shall issue a permit therefore and the owner may then proceed to install the said facilities. 
    Except as hereinafter provided, it shall be unlawful to construct or maintain any privy, privy vault, septic tank, cesspool, or other facility intended or used for the disposal of wastewater. 
    The owner of all houses, buildings, or properties situated within the City and used for human occupancy, employment, recreation, or other purposes, the property line of which is now or may in the future be within three hundred (300) ft. of a public sanitary sewer of the City, is hereby required at his sole expense to install suitable toilet facilities therein, and to connect such facilities directly with the proper public sewer in accordance with the provision of this ordinance, within thirty (30) days after date of official notice to do so. 
(Ord. No. O-10-117) 
10.28.03 - Private sewage disposal. 
    Where a public sanitary sewer is not available under the provisions of Article II, Section 4, the building sewer shall be connected to a private wastewater disposal system complying with the provisions of this section. 
    Before commencement of construction of a private wastewater disposal system the owner shall first obtain a written permit signed by the Environmental Specialist. The application for such permit shall be made on a form furnished by the Arkansas Department of Health, which the applicant shall supplement by any plans, specifications, and other information as are deemed necessary by the City. The minimum lot area for a single-family residence shall be in accordance with current Arkansas Department of Health regulations. 
    A permit for a private wastewater disposal system shall not become effective until the installation is completed to the satisfaction of the Environmental Specialist. He shall be allowed to inspect the work at any stage of construction and, in any event, the applicant for the permit shall notify the Environmental Specialist when the work is ready for final inspection and before any underground portions are covered. The inspection shall be made within twenty-four (24) hours of the receipt of notice by the Environmental Specialist. 
    In the event no portion of the lands owned by the person, firm or corporation installing or desiring to install private sewer facilities thereon shall be situated within three hundred (300) ft. of a public sewer system or a privately owned sewer system which is connected with and discharges into a public sewer system, then the owner of such lands may install a private wastewater disposal system in strict compliance with the specifications of the Arkansas Department of Health. If, the property being more than three hundred (300) ft. from any such sewer line, the owner thereof does not desire to connect with any such sewer system, such owner shall nevertheless file his application for sewer permit and a building permit in accordance with the ordinances of the City, but upon receiving such application said Inspector shall refuse to issue a building permit or a plumbing permit therefore and it is expressly provided, however, that said private wastewater disposal system shall be constructed in strict compliance with the specifications of the Arkansas Department of Health. The construction and installation of the septic tank and field lines of the same shall be inspected and approved by the Environmental Specialist at the times and in the manner set forth by the Rules and Regulations of the Arkansas Department of Health and approved by the Manager of Water Systems.

If, in the discretion of the Manager of Water Systems, based on City Subdivision and Zoning Regulations, there is a possible building site between the building to be served and the City sewer main, then a sewer main shall be constructed past the possible building site to the building to be served. Before a new residence or business building shall be tied onto an existing building sewer, written permission to do so must be obtained from the Manager of Water Systems. 
    Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test by the Owner and approval of the Manager of Water Systems, to meet all requirements of this ordinance. 
    In the absence of code provisions or in amplifications thereof, the materials and procedures set forth by the Manager of Water Systems shall apply. The Water Systems Department of said City is hereby expressly empowered to inspect any and all work done and all materials used in constructing, laying, extending or repairing such building sewers and may, at its discretion, have an inspector at the site of construction at any and all times. The construction, reconstruction or repair of any such sewer may be halted by the Manager of Water Systems when in his discretion, or in the discretion of his duly authorized representative, the work is being done in such manner or under such conditions that the resulting sewer will be substandard or detrimental to the sewer system of the City. Prior to contacting the Water Systems Department for an inspection of a new building sewer or the repair of an existing building sewer, the sewer pipe shall have been laid and backfilled up to the center line of the pipe. The Manager of Water Systems, or his duly authorized representative, is hereby further empowered to order the removal of any connection made to the public sewer system when such connection has been made in violation of any provision of this ordinance, or other ordinances of said City, or of any rule or regulation promulgated hereunder, or when, in his discretion, such construction or connection is detrimental to the municipal sewer system. In the event such order for the removal of a building sewer is not complied with forthwith, the Water Systems Department is hereby empowered to use its own forces to disconnect such building sewer and to collect from the property owner a reasonable fee therefore. 
    Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the City sewer, wastewater carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the building sewer. 
    No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains, unmetered water source, or other sources of surface runoff or ground water to a building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer, nor shall any person make or cause to be made, any opening into a sewer main or drain whereby surface water is permitted to enter the sanitary sewer system of the City, either directly or indirectly. 
    The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made by the Water Systems Department, and all costs thereof shall be paid by the property owner. The owner(s) shall indemnify the City from any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the building sewer. 
    All connections into the public sewer shall conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations and the procedures set forth in appropriate specifications (latest revision thereof). All such connections shall be made gastight and watertight and shall be verified by proper testing. All materials and methods of construction shall conform to Conway Corporation standard specifications. 
    All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and warning lights so as to protect the public from hazard, all in accordance with applicable standards. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the City. 
    All repairs or replacement of building sewers, regardless of length, shall be subject to the same inspection and material requirements as new installations. Where the repair or replacement of the building sewer requires a new point of connection to the City sewer main, the abandoned building sewer shall be sealed to prevent entrance of surface water or debris into the City sewer main by the Water Systems Department and all costs thereof shall be paid by the property owner. A double cleanout shall be installed in building sewer lines, where holes are needed for rodding the line. The repaired building sewer shall be inspected and approved by the Manager of Water Systems.

Chapter 11.52 - PARKING LOTS 

11.52.01 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this ordinance is to reduce curb cuts on city streets, to reduce accidents caused by backing out of parking lots into streets, to make parking lots more attractive and thereby improve their value, to improve traffic flow and to provide more attractive green space. 
11.52.02 - Applicability. 
    This ordinance shall apply to all new parking lots. When existing areas are expanded and require permits, this ordinance shall apply to the parking lots serving those areas. This ordinance will not apply to street parking or to lots where maintenance only is being done or to parking lots for one- or two-family dwellings. 
11.52.03 - Requirements for side areas. 
    If the parking area is within forty (40) ft. of a property line, some landscaping must be done. A four-foot wide perimeter strip, planted with grass or covered with an attractive ground cover, must be left between the parking lot and the property line. Trees or shrubs must be planted in such perimeter areas to provide at least one (1) tree or shrub for every forty (40) ft. of perimeter strip and shall provide a minimum vertical eight (8) ft. height clearance to the lowest limb. A five- to six-foot barrier (live or not) must be provided if the lot adjoins a residential area to ensure the privacy of the residence. Access between adjoining lots may be provided by drives no greater than forty-foot wide. Concrete curbing is required around all planted areas and all strips. 
11.52.04 - Requirements along public rights-of-way. 
    A six-foot strip between any parking lot and a public right-of-way or a six-foot strip between any street curb and property line, provided that a five-foot setback is maintained between the street curb and parking lot. Trees, curbing and plantings are required as above. Access curb cuts to parking lots from the streets shall not exceed forty (40) ft. in width and may be no less than forty (40) ft. apart. Except for curb cuts for driveways serving specific single-family residences on a lot on which a horizontal property regime has been established. In such cases, the curb cuts shall not exceed forty-four (44) ft. in width and may be no less than eighteen (18) ft. apart. Access curb cuts must be at least fifty (50) ft. from the nearest street intersection to minimize traffic hazards at intersections. Exceptions may be granted only by the City Council. 
11.52.05 - Safety. 
    Lots shall be laid out so as to discourage backing into public streets, except for local streets. As identified in the Conway, Arkansas, Master Street Plan, year 2005 and future amendments or City Council approval. 
11.52.06 - Interiors. 
    Five percent (5%) of the interior of lots having more than twenty-five (25) spaces shall be devoted to landscape plantings. Such planted areas shall contain at least eighty (80) sq. ft. and include one (1) tree or shrub per twenty-five (25) parking spaces, evenly distributed throughout the lot. Appropriate ground cover, including low shrubs which shall be maintained less than thirty (30) inches tall should be used in planted areas. 
    All plantings will count toward the minimum required for side areas and right-of-way areas. Property owners shall be responsible for planting and maintenance of grass only on the rights-of-way abutting his property. No trees or shrubs shall be planted on the five-foot setback between the street curb and the six-foot strip. 
    The intent is to exclude industrial storage and work areas from the requirements for interior coverage, therefore; industrial yards and compounds used for storing materials, manufactured products, equipment and/or for truck loading and unloading shall be excluded from interior landscaping requirements. 
11.52.07 - Pavement. 
    All parking lots shall be surfaced with a durable asphalt material or concrete. Minimum specifications are on file in the Planning Department. Chapter 9.04 Minimum Standards For Construction of the Conway Municipal Code shall be complied with in paving operations and thicknesses. 
11.52.08 - Maintenance. 
    Plants, trees and ground cover appropriate for this climate shall be used. It is intended that this ordinance improve the visual quality of public parking lots and that lot owners maintain the lot, planting, curbs and ground cover with that goal in mind. 
11.52.09 - Exceptions. 
    The interior requirements of this ordinance may be waived in those cases where storage and loading areas are the primary usage of the lot. 
11.52.10 - Permits. 
    Permits will be granted only after a detailed plan has been submitted. Work must be started within one hundred twenty (120) days of the permit date and must be continued until completion. All existing safety requirements for public construction must be met. A Certificate of Completion must be issued upon completion and before occupancy can begin. An on-site inspection must be made before the Certificate of Completion may be issued. 
11.52.11 - Fees. 
    A fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) will be charged for all permits for lots of less than twenty-six (26) spaces. Ten dollars ($10.00) will be charged for each additional fifty (50) spaces or portion thereof. The fees pay for the initial inspection only. Additional inspections will cost twelve dollars ($12.00) each. 
11.52.12 - Cash bond or surety bond for postponed improvements. 
    When the then current season of the year is not conducive to sustaining life for trees and plants required hereunder, and/or it would be advantageous for the paving base to have longer to set up prior to paving, compliance with these provisions may be postponed for not more than one (1) year and a temporary Certificate of Occupancy issued and/or electrical power connected to a related structure conditioned on the owner and/or developer posting a cash or surety performance bond or letter of credit payable to the City of Conway, Arkansas, in an amount equal to the estimated cost of the postponed improvements. Estimates of landscaping costs shall be prepared by a Landscape Contractor. Failure to complete such postponed landscaping within any such one-year postponement period shall effect an automatic forfeiture of the bond or letter of credit; provided, however, such forfeiture shall not relieve the owner and/or developer from complying with the provisions of this ordinance.

provisions of this Ordinance.
2. R-2A TWO-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT
PURPOSE
The R-2A district encourages similar basic restrictions as the R-1 districts and permits a
quiet, slightly higher population density area for living protected from all commercial and
industrial activity.
1) Such a district shall encourage and maintain duplex development at appropriate
locations.
44
2) The R-2A District has a dual purpose. First, the District should provide areas for
the development of two-family residential structures on larger lots. Second, the
District should facilitate conversion of one family residences to two-family use in
established developed areas. The District may be located in developed areas or
undeveloped areas of the City where an environment compatible with moderate
density residential development can be established. Such a district can also be
located in medium density areas where conversion may facilitate their continuation
as a desirable area. Accessory uses and conditional uses as provided for in this
Ordinance, shall be allowed provided they are not of an objectionable character and
that they conform to the provisions of this Ordinance.
3. R-2 LOW DENSITY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT
PURPOSE
The R-2 district encourages the same basic restrictions as the R-2A districts and permits
a slightly higher population density area for family living protected from all commercial
and industrial activity.
Accessory uses and conditional uses as provided for in this Ordinance, shall be allowed
provided they are not of an objectionable character and that they conform to provisions
of this Ordinance.
4. SR SUBURBAN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT
The SR District is designed to provide quiet, extremely low-density areas for singlefamily
living and related recreational, religious and educational facilities protected from
all commercial and industrial activity.
The SR District is characterized by single-family homes located on large lots or acreage.
The lot size and configuration shall be as delineated on a plat approved by Conway
Planning Commission and properly recorded prior to SR zoning approval. Lots in the SR
District cannot be altered or subdivided. Subdivision of lots in an SR zone shall be
accomplished only by said lots being rezoned by ordinance of the City Council after
proper notification and hearings as set out in Section 901.4 of the Conway Land
Development Code.
45
Persons seeking SR zoning must own 100 percent of the property located within the
proposed zone.
Accessory uses and conditional uses as provided for in this Ordinance shall be allowed
provided they are not of an objectionable character and that they conform to provisions
of this Ordinance.
5. MF-1 MULTI-FAMILY DISTRICT
PURPOSE
MF-1 Multi-Family District is established to provide suitable areas for medium residential
development of not more than twelve (12) units per gross acre in density, unattached or
attached. No MF-1 District shall be less than one acre in area.
Such units would be located in city areas where adequate city facilities existed prior to
development or would be provided in conjunction with development, and where a
suitable environment for moderate residential development would be available. Such
districts could be used in suburban portions of the city as buffer or transitional zones
between single-family and other uses not compatible with low-density residential
development. Accessory uses and conditional uses as provided for in this Ordinance
shall be permitted in the are if they are not of an objectionable characteristic and
conform to provisions of this Ordinance. Within this area, single-family dwelllings on lots
without side yard setback requirements on one side yard are permitted. Also, the
townhouse concept which permits construction of single-family dwelllings abutting one
another without side yards between individual units is permitted. If such units are not
abutting, a six (6) foot setback from side property lines is required.
When computing gross density of a tract of land, any and all common open space may
be used in said calculation.
6. MF-2 MULTI-FAMILY DISTRICT
PURPOSE
The MF-2 Multi-Family District provides a suitable area within the City for medium to
high density residential uses and structures with a density of not more than eighteen (18)
units per gross acre. No MF-2 District shall be less than one acre in area.
46
This area could exist in the older sections and newer developed areas of town. Such a
district may be developed adjacent to, or in conjunction with neighborhood commercial
or shopping center development. Adequate public utilities and services shall exist prior
to or be provided in conjunction with development. Such a district may exist as a buffer
zone between single-family and non-compatible use districts. Within this district,
buildings, structures, or uses having commercial characteristics and not planned as a
main part of the total development shall be excluded.
Buildings, structures, or uses having commercial characteristics existing within the MF-2
District shall be planned as an integral part of the total residential development. All other
such commercial structures shall be excluded whether operated for profit or otherwise.
Accessory and conditional uses, as provided for in this Ordinance shall be permitted
provided they are not of an objectionable nature and that they adhere to all Ordinance
provisions set forth herein.
When computing gross density of a tract of land, any and all common open space may
be used in said calculation.
7. MF-3 MULTI-FAMILY DISTRICT
PURPOSE
MF-3 High Density Multi-Family. This district is established in order to provide highdensity
residential structures and conversion of existing residential structures at a
density of not more than twenty-four (24) units per gross acre. No MF-3 District shall be
less than one acre in area.
This district should be located in already developed areas of the City where public
utilities, community facilities and other services are adequate to support them. The MF-
3 District may also act as a buffer between low-density residential areas and nonresidential
development. Buildings, structures, or uses having commercial
characteristics existing within the MF-3 District shall be planned as an integral part of the
total residential development. All other such commercial structures shall be excluded
whether operated for profit or otherwise. Accessory uses and conditional uses, as
provided for in this Ordinance, shall be permitted provided they are not of objectionable
character and that they adhere to all Ordinance provisions set forth herein.
47
Accessory and conditional uses, as provided for in this Ordinance, shall be permitted
provided they are not of an objectionable nature and that they adhere to all Ordinance
provisions set forth herein.
When computing gross density of a tract of land, any and all common open space may
be used in said calculation.
8. RMH MOBILE HOME DISTRICT
PURPOSE
This district recognizes a specific housing type which must be accommodated in the City
of Conway in either rental park settings or in subdivisions which provide for ownership of
the structure and lot. It is the intent of this district that it be located so as to not
adversely affect the established residential development patterns and densities in the
City. Such locations, however, shall have necessary public utilities, community facilities,
and other public services in order to provide a healthful living environment with the
normal amenities associated with residential districts of the City. All mobile home parks
and subdivisions must meet the relevant provisions and conditions contained in Article
601.
9. HR HISTORICAL RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT
PURPOSE

table. However, a principal use building or structure may exceed the maximum allowed height
(but not number of stories) when an additional one foot of interior side yard setback is provided
for each two (2) feet of additional height. This exception does not apply to zero lot line
buildings.
A minimum of ten (10) feet shall separate all detached buildings. Each lot must have a minimum of
thirty-five (35) feet of street frontage. Each lot in R-1, R-2, R-2A, and SR and HR (O -01-33) zoning
districts shall have a minimum street frontage equal to the minimum lot width required at the building
line, except for lots fronting on cul-de-sac turnarounds and on curving street frontages, which must have

SECTION 401.5  COMMERCIAL AND OFFICE DISTRICTS
A. GENERAL DESCRIPTION  COMMERCIAL
Regulations for Commercial Districts are designed to encourage stable and efficient areas to
meet the needs for commercial goods and services of the trade area. The districts are designed
to minimize the adverse effects of commercial users on other land uses and provide
opportunities for investment with development of residential areas and thoroughfares.
The Commercial Districts shall provide sufficient space, at appropriate locations in close
proximity to established residential areas for retail and service trade. Such commercial
establishments cater to receiving shopping needs of occupants of nearby residential areas.
The Districts shall provide sufficient and appropriate space to meet anticipated future need for
planned commercial developments in central shopping districts, regional, community and
neighborhood shopping centers.
Provision of off-street parking space in conjunction with commercial area development shall be
fostered through Commercial Districts establishment. Establishments will be encouraged
through the Districts to congregate in planned developments to the consumer and merchants
advantage.
1. C-1 CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT
PURPOSE
A concentrated central core accommodating commercial and personal services of all
kinds, governmental, business, financial and general offices to satisfy the needs of the
community and surrounding trade area. The uses in this area require a central location
accessible from all routes entering the City, and they must be grouped so that the
transient or infrequent shopper can park and visit a number of stores and offices on foot.
2. C-2 NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICT
PURPOSE
The C-2 District provides use areas for retail trade and personal service enterprises
designed to serve surrounding residential neighborhoods. Parking requirements and
bulk regulations are more stringent in this area to ensure compatibility with the
residential districts which surround it.
53
Such a district should depend chiefly on neighborhood business and less on larger
service areas outside the neighborhood. Such a district may also serve as an extension
of an established commercial district. C-2 District shall generally be located at arterial or
collector street intersections and should be within walking distance of area
neighborhoods. Permitted also shall be a mixture of residential uses to aid integration
with established developments and to encourage multi-use project development.
3. C-3 HIGHWAY SERVICE & OPEN DISPLAY DISTRICT
PURPOSE
The C-3 District is designed to encourage the development of recognizable, attractive
groupings of facilities to serve persons traveling by automobile, as well as to provide
certain amusement facilities serving the area. It is also a zone for business that serves a
city or regional trade area but which cannot command a location in the Central Business
District or Neighborhood Shopping Areas because of small volume, special clientele,
need for parking or similar reasons. The district has a high level of vehicular ingress and
egress. Merchandise may be of a type that must have special display and storage
outside of building and requires special transportation. This type of retail trade is not
compatible with pedestrian oriented commercial districts and shopping centers because
they impede pedestrian movement. Locations appropriate for such districts are along
heavily traveled major arterials.
4. C-4 LARGE SHOPPING CENTER COMMERCIAL DISTRICT
PURPOSE
The purpose of this district shall be to establish and preserve general commercial areas
consisting of shopping center and commercial developments where customers reach
individual business establishments primarily by automobile. Developments of the C-4
type are intended to serve broad commercial community needs and shall be developed
according to an approved plan. Because such districts will frequently be close to
residential development, screening setback and other development criteria are included.
Such inclusion is present to aid in achievement of compatible relationships between
retail developments and adjacent residential areas.
54
B. GENERAL DESCRIPTION  OFFICE
The purpose of these districts is to provide protection through zoning classifications for existing
office use and to encourage new high standard development of office commercial structures.
The zones also allow development of colleges and other institutions and uses that are incidental
to institutions but not harmful to residential character of neighborhoods.
1. O-1 GENERAL OFFICE DISTRICT
PURPOSE
This district is established for the purpose of providing appropriate locations for welldesigned
office facilities on large tracts, generally not available in developed areas of the
City. Such developments should meet proper requirements for integration with
surrounding neighborhoods. This type of development could be in an undeveloped area
or facilitate expansion of a present facility. Low intensity land use and a park type
setting are characteristic of this district. Limited retail and service uses are permitted as
accessories to the principal use.
This district is also established to accommodate offices and associated administrative,
executive and professional uses in new and existing structures together with specified
institutional and accessory uses. The O-1 District is characterized by freestanding
buildings and ancillary parking, and shall be limited to arterial streets, locations in
developed areas or carefully selected areas where public utilities, community facilities
and other services could support such development.
2. O-2 QUIET OFFICE DISTRICT
PURPOSE
The purpose of this district is to provide conversion of older structures no longer useful,
serviceable or desirable in present use to office use. Such offices will be located in
established city areas and in close proximity to apartments and other residential uses.
Parking and heights will be designed for compatibility with the residential area adjacent
to it. New construction designed to reinforce existing area characteristics and not
detrimental to the use of the surrounding projects for residential use will also be allowed
in the district.
55
3. O-3 RESTRICTED OFFICE DISTRICT
PURPOSE
The purpose of this district is to provide conversion of older structures no longer useful,
serviceable, or desirable in present use to office use and to provide appropriate locations
for offices which are in proximity to both residential and nonresidential zones. Such
offices will have minimal to no negative impact on the residential areas. Parking and
heights will be designed for compatibility with any residential area adjacent to it. Singlefamily
and duplex construction will also be allowed in this district. New construction
designed to reinforce existing area characteristics and not detrimental to the use of the
surrounding projects for residential use will also be allowed in the district.
C. USE REGULATIONS
1. Permitted Uses
The permitted uses for this district are set forth below. Where the letter X appears on
the line of a use and column of a district the listed use is permitted. Where the letter C
occurs similarly within the chart the use is permitted subject to acquiring a conditional
use permit as set forth in Article 901  Section 901.2. Where neither X nor C appears
similarly within the chart, the use is not permitted.
Permitted uses in these districts are subject to (a) the provision for off-street parking as
required in Article 501, except for the C-1 Central Business District; (b) conformance to
the special conditions applying to certain uses and set forth in Article 601 where such
reference is made; and (c) the provision of off-street loading in accordance with Article
501.

The Industrial District Zones are to provide for development of light to heavy industrial uses and
related facilities. The regulations for the Industrial Districts are designed to:
63
(1) make available a range of suitable sites for all types of manufacturing and related activities;
(2) protect residences by separating them from manufacturing activities and by limiting the use
of each space for new residential development; (3) provide restricted areas for those industries
emitting objectionable noises, odors, or which involve danger of fire or explosives; (4) to protect
industrial activities and related developments against congestion, as appropriate for each area,
by limiting building bulk in relation to surrounding land and other industries and providing offstreet
parking and loading with each development; (5) to promote desirable land use and
building development direction and to provide stability for industry and related development in
an effort to strengthen the Citys economic base; and (6) to protect district character and usage
and to conserve land and building value.

78
SECTION 401.10  PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
A. General Description. The Planned Unit Development (PUD) district is intended to
accommodate developments that might otherwise be impractical or impossible to implement
through traditional zoning. Through a coordinated effort involving public participation, a PUD
district offers the developer an opportunity to create a unique project that also provides an
appropriate level of compatibility with surrounding development. A PUD project allows the
creation of alternative development standards in order to address each PUDs unique
characteristics. Variances include, but are not limited to; land use, building setbacks,
parking, density, etc. The PUD district also allows the setting of conditions by the Planning
Commission/City Council including, but not limited to; land use, building setbacks, parking,
density, common space, green space, ingress/egress points, architectural design, and
landscaping/buffering.
A Planned Unit Development request includes both a rezoning request and a PUD plan. In
reviewing a proposed PUD district, the Planning and Development Department, Planning
Commission, and City Council consider these components in tandem. Approval of a PUD
district by the City Council includes approval of both the rezoning request and the PUD plan.
Upon approval, the proposed project must also be platted in accordance with the subdivision
regulations and undergo Development Review, as outlined in Article 1101 of the Conway
Zoning Ordinance. A plat is not required if the property has already been legally platted.
B. Planned Unit Development Requirements. Because a Planned Unit Development should be
designed to function in a cohesive manner, the PUD proposal should provide a sidewalk
system, common space, and, typically, a property owners association. The location of the
site in relation to existing roads, services, and neighborhoods shall be taken into account.
The Director of Planning and Development, the Planning Commission, and/or the City
Council may require additional provisions.
1. Relation to Utilities and Major Roads. A Planned Unit Development district shall be
located in relation to utility systems, storm drainage systems, and major roads so that
neither extension nor enlargement of such facilities at public expense shall be
necessary. However, PUD districts may be approved at locations lacking such services if
the applicant makes provision to offset the cost of extension and/or enlargement of such
services.
2. Internal Street Network. A Planned Unit Development shall include an internal system of
streets, parking aisles, and/or cross access drives that can safely and efficiently
accommodate vehicular traffic generated by the PUD. Where site conditions are
sufficient, a gridded road network that provides maximum connectivity within the PUD
and with surrounding development is desirable.
3. Sidewalk System. Unless there are outstanding design reasons that warrant otherwise,
all internal streets within a Planned Unit Development shall include pedestrian
sidewalks, which shall be constructed in accordance with Section 1101 of the Zoning
Ordinance.
4. Common Space. The incorporation of plazas, courtyards, and other outdoor spaces for
people to gather is encouraged. These common spaces should be located in an area of
the site which makes the space easily identifiable and accessible for public and/or
private use. Proximity and connectivity to existing public/private common space such as
parks, trails, greenbelts, playgrounds, and natural areas should be taken into
79
consideration. These public/private common spaces should be sheltered as much as
possible from incompatible uses.
5. Green Space / Pervious Surface
a. Planned Unit Developments less than three acres shall dedicate a minimum of 5
percent to 20 percent of the total project area to pervious surface typically reserved
for green space and/or landscaping.
b. Planned Unit Developments three acres or larger shall dedicate a minimum of 20
percent of the total project area to pervious surface typically reserved for green
space and/or landscaping.
6. Property Owners Association. The Planned Unit Development proposal shall include
provision for a property owners association. This requirement may be waived where a
property owners association may not be necessary such as a PUD with a sole owner.
The property owners association shall consist of all persons and corporations owning
property within the PUD. Maintenance of all common areas, parking areas, and refuse
facilities shall be the responsibility of the property owners association. Cost for sharing
such maintenance shall be specified in the property owners association agreement.
7. Plan Preparation. Pre-application plans do not require a design professional stamp,
however applicants are encouraged to work with design professionals as early as
possible in PUD planning. The Planned Unit Development proposal officially submitted
for Planning Commission review shall be reviewed and stamped by an architect,
landscape architect, or engineer licensed by the State of Arkansas.
C. Procedures For Obtaining PUD Approval
1. Pre-Application Reviews
a. Department Meeting. The PUD applicant shall present a draft PUD proposal to
Planning and Development Department staff. The draft PUD proposal should include
a rough sketch of a site plan and an explanation of why a PUD district is necessary
for development. Pre-application plans do not require a design professional stamp.
The applicant should become familiar with the Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances
prior to the scheduled Department Meeting. The Director of Planning and
Development and staff will provide the applicant with comments and
recommendations.
b. Development Review Committee Pre-Application Conference. Following the
Department Meeting, the Director of Planning and Development will schedule a Pre-
Application Conference with the Development Review Committee, which consists of
representatives of the Planning and Development Department, Street Department,
Sanitation Department, Fire Department, and Conway Corporation. At the Director of
Planning and Developments discretion, other relevant parties may be asked to
attend the Pre-Application Conference to offer comments and suggestions. The
applicant shall present a PUD proposal to the Development Review Committee that
includes draft versions of a site plan including any common space and/or green
space, descriptions of land uses, and street layout. Building elevations may also be
presented. Pre-application plans do not require a design professional stamp.
Following the Pre-Application Conference, the Development Review Committee
80
comments and suggestions will be incorporated into a single document and provided
to the applicant.
c. Public Meeting. The Director of Planning and Development or designee shall
schedule a Public Meeting at which time the applicant shall present the PUD
proposal to all interested parties, including, though not limited to, neighborhood
residents, property owners associations, neighboring business owners, City officials,
and community groups. Notice of the public meeting shall be published on the City of
Conways website at least 15 days prior to the meeting. A Public Hearing sign shall
be conspicuously posted on the subject property at least 15 days prior to the public
meeting. The applicant shall use relevant comments gathered at the public meeting
to amend the PUD proposal in a manner that is both feasible for the applicant and
most satisfactory to the interested parties.
2. Planned Unit Development Application Submittal
a. Procedure. Upon completion of all pre-application reviews, the applicant may
proceed in preparing the Application for a Planned Unit Development for the Conway
Planning Commission. The application shall be processed following the procedure
for a change of zone district boundary as set forth in Article 901.4, excepting fees.
b. Fees. All Planned Unit Development filing fees are non-refundable and must be paid
to the Conway Planning and Development Department at the time application is
made. Filing fees will be credited towards Development Review fees.
i. Residential.
$525.00 PUD with 10 or fewer residential units
$725.00 PUD with 11-25 residential units
$1,125.00 PUD with 26 or more residential units
ii. Non-Residential.
$1,125 PUD with a non-residential component
c. Application Requirements. The Application for a Planned Unit Development must be
accompanied by a preliminary PUD plan consisting of a site plan, explanatory text,
and necessary exhibits. The PUD plan should expound upon the initial PUD proposal
by incorporating the comments gathered throughout the pre-application process. The
preliminary PUD plan should include applicable documents including: description of
existing conditions, clarification of the purpose and intent of the PUD, list of allowable
land uses, height and size of proposed building types, and site-specific development
standards, development phasing and construction schedule, and covenants and
restrictions. All items must be submitted at the time of PUD application to be deemed
complete for review. Any omission of a required submittal item shall be identified and
the reason for omission explained in the PUD Plan. If the PUD is to be constructed in
multiple phases, the applicant shall clearly indicate the boundaries of each proposed
phase on the site plan.
d. Public Notice of Planning Commission Hearing. Prior to the Planning Commissions
review of the PUD application, sufficient notice of a public hearing for rezoning shall
be furnished in accordance with the public hearing procedure outlined in Article
901.4(C)(3) of the Conway Zoning Ordinance.
81
e. Planning Commission Action. At its regular monthly meeting, the Planning
Commission shall review the PUD application and accompanying PUD Plan and
shall conduct a public hearing at which time the applicant, as well as members of the
community, may address the Commission. The Planning Commission shall take one
of four actions: send the rezoning request to the City Council with a positive
recommendation; send the rezoning request to the City Council with a negative
recommendation; send the rezoning request to the City Council with no
recommendation; or hold the rezoning request in committee pending additional
information or clarification from the applicant.
f. City Council Consideration. Upon receiving the PUD recommendation from the
Planning Commission and reviewing the PUD application and PUD Plan, the City
Council shall consider an ordinance establishing a PUD district. The City Council
shall take one of three actions: approve the PUD request as recommended by the
Planning Commission; approve the PUD request with amendment(s); or deny the
PUD request.
3. Final PUD Plan. Following City Council approval, the applicant shall submit a Final PUD
Plan to the Planning and Development Department for review. This Final PUD Plan shall
incorporate any amendments or additions as approved by the City Council. This Final
PUD Plan shall serve as the binding document that will guide the PUDs development
and land use.
4. Platting, Development Review, Building Permits, Other District Regulations. Approval of
a PUD district does not relieve the applicant of subdivision platting, development review,
building permit, or overlay district requirements. Following City Council approval and
prior to submission for Development Review and the issuance of building permits, a final
plat must be submitted and approved. A plat is not required if the property has been
legally platted. Except as specifically provided for in the individual PUD ordinance, all
development shall be undertaken in conformance with adopted departmental rules and
procedures. Where specific amendments to departmental rules and procedures have
been included in the adopted PUD ordinance, all reviews shall be conducted and permits
shall be issued in conformance with the provisions of the approved PUD plan.
a. Platting. Upon approval of the PUD request by the City Council, and after the
submittal of the Final PUD Plan, a plat shall be prepared in the manner prescribed in
the Conway Subdivision Regulations. Minor plats may receive departmental
approval. Major plats shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission. A plat is not
required if the property has been legally platted. However, dedication of rights of way
and easements as required by the Conway Subdivision Ordinance shall be required.
b. Development Review. Upon approval of both the Final Development PUD Plan and
the Final Plat, the applicant may submit the project to the Planning and Development
Department for Development Review. (See Article 1101 of the Zoning Ordinance and
the Design Standards Pattern Book published by the Conway Planning and
Development Department for more information on Development Review.) The
Development Review process must be completed before the applicant can apply for
or obtain any building permits from the City of Conway.
c. Building Permits. After completion of subdivision platting and development review,
construction documents may be presented to the Permits Division for commercial
building plans review. Single family and duplex structures are not subject to building
plans review.
82
d. Other District Regulations. If the PUD project is within an overlay district, historic
district, or other special district area, applicable regulations must be applied and/or
approvals must be obtained from relevant commissions or boards.
D. Procedures For Amending a PUD Plan. If during the course of the implementation of a
Planned Unit Development, the applicant and/or developer find it necessary or desirable to
modify the approved PUD Plan, the applicant and/or developer may request a PUD
amendment. Such request shall be made in writing to the Director of Planning and
Development, who will determine whether the requested modification meets the criteria of a
minor modification or major modification. All modifications must be consistent with the intent
of this ordinance.
1. Minor Modifications. Minor modifications are granted administratively by the Director of
Planning and Development and do not require legislative action. For a requested
modification to be classified as minor, the modification must: alter one or more
provisions of the Final PUD Plan, not expand the types of land uses specifically allowed
in the approved Final PUD Plan, not change the character or function of driveways or
streets approved in the Final PUD Plan, not cause any foreseeable significant increase
in traffic volume or result in any foreseeable negative impacts on traffic flow, not
significantly reduce the amount and/or distribution of common space or green/pervious
space, and not create any significant change to the nature or character of the approved
PUD.
2. Major Modifications. Major modifications are tentatively granted by the Director of
Planning and Development and require City Council notification. A modification that
would result in any of the following will be deemed major: expansion of the types of land
uses specifically allowed in the approved Final PUD Plan, change in the character or
function of driveways or streets approved in the Final PUD Plan, foreseeable significant
increase in traffic volume or foreseeable negative impacts on traffic flow, reduction in the
amount and/or distribution of common space or green/pervious space, or any significant
change to the nature or character of the approved development. Additionally, the
Director of Planning and Development may elect to follow the method for major
modification approval for any modification of any lesser magnitude, particularly if such
modification is deemed to be in the public interest.
a. Major Modification Approved by Director of Planning and Development. The Director
of Planning and Development may approve the major modification and grant the
request.
i. City Council Notification. If the Director of Planning and Development grants the
requested major modification, he/she must notify all City Council members on the
same day that the modification is granted. The notification must be delivered by
letter, email, telephone contact, placement of a notice in each Councilpersons
mailbox at City Hall, or another manner approved by the Mayor.
ii. City Council Objections. If any individual City Council member objects to the
major modification, the Council member must notify the Director of Planning and
Development of such objection within no less than five (5) working days from the
date of the Directors decision to grant the request. Upon receiving an objection
from a Council member, the Director shall refer the major modification request to
the Planning Commission for review.
83
(a) Public Notice of Planning Commission Hearing. Prior to the Planning
Commissions review of the PUD modification request, sufficient notice of a
public hearing for rezoning shall be furnished in accordance with state law
and per the public hearing procedure outlined in Article 901.4(C)(3) of the
Conway Zoning Ordinance. (O-09-102)
(b) Planning Commission Approval. After reviewing the major modification
request, the Planning Commission may grant the request.
(c) Planning Commission Denial. After reviewing the major modification request,
the Planning Commission may deny the request. If the Planning Commission
denies the major modification request, the applicant may appeal the decision
to the City Council by submitting a notice of appeal to the Planning and
Development Department no less than thirty (30) working days from the date
of the Planning Commissions decision. The appeal shall be placed on the
agenda of the next scheduled meeting of the City Council. The City Councils
decision is final.
a. Major Modification Denied by Director of Planning and Development. The Director of
Planning and Development may deny the major modification request. The Directors
decision may be appealed to the Planning Commission by notifying the Planning
Commission of such appeal no less than thirty (30) working days from the date of the
Directors decision to deny the major modification request.
i. Public Notice of Planning Commission Hearing. Prior to the Planning
Commissions review of the PUD modification request, sufficient notice of a
public hearing for rezoning shall be furnished in accordance with state law and
per the public hearing procedure outlined in Article 901.4(C)(3) of the Conway
Zoning Ordinance. (O-09-102)
ii. Planning Commission Approval. After reviewing the major modification request,
the Planning Commission may grant the request.
iii. Planning Commission Denial. After reviewing the major modification request, the
Planning Commission may deny the request. If the Planning Commission denies
the major modification request, the applicant may appeal the decision to the City
Council by submitting a notice of appeal to the Planning and Development
Department no less than thirty (30) working days from the date of the Planning
Commissions decision. The appeal shall be placed on the agenda of the next
scheduled meeting of the City Council. The City Councils decision is final.
2. Additional Rules Regarding Modifications
a. Public Hearing. The request for a major modification shall not subject the entire Final
PUD Plan to a public hearing. Only the portion(s) of the Final PUD Plan necessary to
evaluate the major modification request under consideration is (are) subject to any
required public hearing(s).
b. Precedent. Minor and major modifications shall be considered unique and shall not
set precedent for other developments.
84
E. Project Completion. At its discretion, the Planning Commission may periodically review the
Planned Unit Development projects implementation status. If the Planning Commission
determines that the PUD is not being implemented in accordance with the Final PUD Plan,
the Planning Commission may recommend that the City Council review the progress of the
project. The City Council may allow implementation of the project to continue uninterrupted,
may require the applicant and/or developer to submit a revised PUD plan, or may take any
other reasonable action to ensure that the subject property is not developed in an
inappropriate manner.
SECTION 401.1011  OVERLAY DISTRICT
A. GENERAL DESCRIPTION
It is the purpose and intent of the Overlay District to provide enhanced standards to protect
and enhance the unique characteristics of specific areas and/or corridors while providing for
development opportunities. These characteristics may include natural scenic beauty,
manmade features or other features. Overlay Districts may also be used to protect or
facilitate a particular design theme established through specific architectural styles or
periods, or to protect or facilitate site plan conventions such as setbacks that are both
minimums and maximums. The purposes of any Overlay District may include:
1. Promoting the safe and efficient use of specific roadways by controlling access and
other traffic measures.
2. Encouraging the redevelopment of an area consistent with a particular design theme.
3. Minimizing the detrimental impact of development on hillsides, watercourses and other
significant natural features.
4. Giving special attention to landscaping, buffering, signage, lighting and building setbacks
in those districts identified as needing special attention.
5. Giving special attention to the existing architectural style or to the style which is planned,
so as to create an easily identifiable area in those areas identified as architecturally
significant.
B. ESTABLISHMENT OF OVERLAY DISTRICTS
The City Council of the City of Conway may adopt Overlay Districts as the needs are
identified in order to implement specific purposes, intents, and design standards based upon
the adopted Land Use Plan for the area being regulated, which shall be applied as
additional standards to other ordinance regulations required by the City. Such Overlay
Districts shall be made a part of the Zoning Ordinance through the amendment process as
stipulated in this Ordinance. Upon adoption, the boundaries of such Overlay Districts shall
be shown on the Zoning Map of the City of Conway.
C. DEVELOPMENT CRITERIA
The development criteria for each Overlay District shall be those standards as set out in
each Overlay District. (Ordinance O-99-72)
SECTION 401.1112  SPECIFIC PLAN (SP) DISTRICT (O-09-100)
A. GENERAL DESCRIPTION
The Specific Plan (SP) district provides a means by which individualized zoning standards
can be created for defined areas in which conventional zoning cannot achieve desired results.
85
The SP district may be applied as either a base zone or an overlay zone depending on the
defined areas needs and the scope of any proposed project(s) within the defined area. The SP
district must be accompanied by a Specific Plan, which is a small-area plan document
designed with community input. Each Specific Plan has its own non-transferable set of
regulations which may combine some or all of the following elements for a defined area into
one document: zoning standards, list of acceptable land uses, design guidelines, infrastructure
plan, phasing plan, and other elements as appropriate.
The Planning and Development Department shall schedule a Specific Plan study for an area
upon the request of the Conway Planning Commission, Conway City Council, or the
Mayors Office, or upon its own initiative. Businesses, institutions, and/or residents may
request that an area be considered for a Specific Plan study by contacting any of the above
entities. Generally, developer-initiated projects are not appropriate for Specific Plan studies;
rather, private developers should follow the guidelines for Planned Unit Developments for
large-scale projects that are not possible through conventional zoning. (See Section 401.9 
Planned Unit Development.)
B. SPECIFIC PLAN DISTRICT REQUIREMENTS
1. Land Use Controls
Pre-existing, legal, non-conforming uses shall be allowed to continue in a SP district.
2. Plan Elements
A Specific Plan shall include the following elements:
a. Identification of the SP districts scope (i.e. overlay or base zone);
b. A map showing the proposed district boundaries and the relationship of the district to
uses and structures within close proximity of the district boundaries;
c. A map or aerial photo of the proposed district and the area immediately surrounding
it, showing sufficient topographic data to indicate clearly the character of the terrain;

It is the intent of these requirements that adequate off-street parking, and loading be provided in
all zoning districts. Such parking and loading shall be provided off the street easement for each
use of land within the City and as demand is created for each use. With construction or
expansion in capacity of a building or structure or if another use is established on the lot, offstreet
parking must be provided in accordance with Article 501 of the Zoning Ordinance.
For every building or structure hereafter constructed in any district for nonresidential purposes,
or where material or merchandise is received or distributed by vehicles, an off-street loading
space shall be provided and maintained on the same lot.
Parking spaces may not be substituted for a loading space or a loading space substituted for a
parking space.
Parking spaces used in connection with an existing or continuing use or building on the effective
date of this Ordinance, up to the number required by this Ordinance shall be continued and may
not be counted as serving a new structure or addition.
SECTION 501.2  REQUIRED OFF-STREET PARKING
Off-street parking or loading space shall be part of the required open space associated with the
permitted use and shall not be reduced or encroached upon in any manner.
All parking shall be in accordance with Ordinance No. O-91-54 AN ORDINANCE
ESTABLISHING MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS FOR PARKING LOTS;
DECLARING AN EMERGENCY AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES.
SECTION 501.3  SIZE OF OFF-STREET PARKING SPACE
The size of an off-street parking space for one vehicle shall be rectangular with dimensions of

or aisles. If the off-street parking space does not abut on a street, alley or easement of access,
there shall be provided an access drive of at least ten (10) feet in width in the case of a dwelling
and at least fifteen (15) feet in width in all other cases leading from the street to the parking.

multi-family housing, rooming houses, dormitories, fraternities, and sororities where the
sponsoring church or institution of higher learning has consented by written agreement to the
use of its excess off-street parking for said purpose. A conditional use permit is required for the
parking on lot(s) not of the same ownership to count toward fulfillment of the parking
requirements. However, a pre-existing, non-conforming use may utilize land for expansion
parking that is under an ownership other than that of the primary use if the required procedures
are followed and the expansion is approved by the City Council as stipulated in this Zoning
Ordinance. Such expansion parking shall not be used for any subsequent use of the property
that is not in compliance with the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance. (Ordinance No. O-03-

ARTICLE 701
NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS, STRUCTURES AND USES OF LAND
SECTION 701.1  CONTINUATION OF NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS,
STRUCTURES AND USES
A nonconforming building or structure legally existing at the time of adoption of this Ordinance
or any use, structure or lot which has been rendered nonconforming by the provision of this
Ordinance may be continued and maintained except as otherwise provided in this Section and
as noted in Section 401.7 Special Zoning Districts. (Ordinance O-11-30)
SECTION 701.2  NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS AND STRUCTURES
A. Alteration, Enlargement or Relocation of Buildings and Structures
A building or structure which is conforming as to use, but is nonconforming as to yards or
height or off-street parking space, may be structurally enlarged or added to provided that the
enlargement or addition complies with the yard and height and off-street parking
requirements of the district in which such building or structure is located. No nonconforming
structure or building shall be moved, in whole or in part, to another location unless every
portion of such building or structure is made to conform to all the regulations of the district in
which it is to be located.
Nothing in the provisions of the foregoing regulation shall in any manner prevent or prohibit
normal maintenance of the premises.
B. Destruction of Nonconforming Buildings or Structures
Any structure developed prior to Ordinance passage that complied with former Ordinance
standards but has been rendered substandard by the new Ordinance may be termed a
preexisting nonconforming structure and, in the event of damage or destruction, may be
rebuilt to completion at the original site within one and one-half (1 ½) years of destruction
and shall not exceed the original dimensions of the nonconforming building or structure.
SECTION 701.3  NONCONFORMING USES
A. Building Vacancy
A building, structure or portion thereof or land utilized for a nonconforming use which is or

122
B. Damage or Destruction of Buildings or Structures
If any structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use is destroyed by
fire, explosion, or other casualty, such structure may be repaired and reconstructed and
used for the same purposes as it was before the damage or destruction, provided such
repair or reconstruction is commenced and completed within one (1) year of the date of such
damage or destruction. In no event shall the structure be rebuilt, repaired or otherwise
altered to increase the floor space or height of the original building in which the
nonconforming use was conducted, except that the building height may be increased to
minimally accommodate building code standards and not increase the nonconforming use.
C. Accessories to Primary Nonconforming Uses
Addition of or enlargement, alteration or relocation of accessories which are incidental to
and accommodate the primary nonconforming use may be permitted if, after notices and
public hearing and recommendation by the Planning Commission, the City Council finds the
accessory promotes the public health, peace, safety and welfare and does not expand or
enlarge the primary nonconforming use.
The procedures for application and review shall be the same as those for a conditional use
with the exception that all notifications and posted signs must make reference to a request
for alteration, enlargement or relocation of the use instead of a request for a conditional use.

decision or determination made by the administrative official in the enforcement of this
Zoning Ordinance. The Board Commission ( may affirm or reverse, in whole or in part, said
decision of the administrative official.
B. Variances
To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of this Zoning
Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a
literal enforcement of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance would result in unnecessary
hardship that would deprive the owner of any reasonable use of the land or building
involved. A variance from the terms of this Zoning Ordinance shall not be granted by the
Planning Commission Board of Adjustment (O-11-97)unless and until:
1. The applicant demonstrates that special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land, structure or building involved and which are not applicable to other
lands, structure or buildings in the same district; that literal interpretation of the
provisions of this Ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by
other properties in the same district under the terms of this Zoning Ordinance; that
special conditions and circumstances do not result from the actions of the applicant; and
that granting the variance requested will not confer on the applicant any special privilege
that is denied by this Zoning Ordinance to other lands, structures, or buildings in the
same district.
2. No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same district,
and no permitted or nonconforming use of lands, structures, or buildings in other districts
shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance.
3. The Planning Commission Board of Adjustment (O-11-97)shall further make a finding
that the reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance and that
the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of land,
building or structure.
125
4. The Planning Commission Board of Adjustment (O-11-97)shall further make a finding
that the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent
of this Zoning Ordinance, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise
detrimental to the public welfare.
In granting any variance, the Planning Commission Board of Adjustment (O-11-97) may
prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards that it deems necessary or desirable.
Violations of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the
variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Zoning Ordinance.

variance to allow a use not permissible under the terms of this Ordinance in the district involved,
or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of this Zoning Ordinance in said
district.

ADMINISTRATION
SECTION 901.1  BUILDING PERMIT REQUIRED

listed as conditional in the district regulations, their use is permitted subject to acquiring a
Conditional Use Permit. The uses designated under the various districts herein as Conditional
Uses are so classified because they more intensely dominate the area in which they are
located than do other uses permitted in the district; however, the nature of such uses makes it
desirable that they be permitted to locate therein. The following procedure is established to
integrate properly the conditional uses with the other land uses located in the district. These
uses shall be reviewed and authorized or rejected under the following procedure:
A. An application shall be filed by the property owner with the City Planning Commission for
review. Said application shall be filed no less than seventeen (17) days prior to the Planning
Commission meeting. Such applications shall show the location and intended use of the
site. A general graphic representation of what is proposed shall be submitted as well.

run in the local newspaper at least once no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the public
hearing. This public notice must include the conditional use sought, the location (including
legal description and address (if no address is available, a description which is clear to the
average lay person will suffice)), and the time, date and place of the public hearing.
C. In addition, the property owner will be required to notify by certified USPS First Class mail
with Certificates of Mailing return receipts requested and/or petition, all property owners
within two hundred (200) feet of the property of his their intention to apply for a conditional
use permit no less than fifteen (15) days prior to the public hearing. The petitioner shall
state the date and time of the public hearing with a certified letter and/or petition. The
Certificates of Mailing postmarked certified receipts and/or return receipts and/or petitions
shall be submitted to the Planning Department staff not less than ten (10) days prior to the
Planning Commission meeting along with a map showing the location of the property in
question as well as the owners within 200 feet of the property and a letter from the petitioner
certifying that the map shows a complete list of those property owners. (O-14-08).

premise of said property. Such sign(s) shall be clearly visible, unobstructed to the passing
general public, and posted on or near the existing front property line not later than fifteen
(15) days prior to the public hearing. The sign shall be provided by the Department of
Planning concurrent with applying for said permit. The applicant shall make a Seventy-Five
Dollar ($75.00) deposit or not less than the cost of replacing the sign, whichever is greater
for said sign refundable if returned. The applicant shall obtain the sign from the Conway
Planning Department and shall pay a fee as established by the City of Conway for the sign. The fee
is not refundable and the sign is not required to be returned. (Ordinance O-02-07)

transmit to the City Council its report as to the effect of such proposed buildings or use upon
the character of the neighborhood, traffic conditions, public utilities, and other matters
pertaining to the general welfare, and recommendation of the Planning Commission
concerning use thereon. Thereupon, the City Council may authorize or deny the issuance of
a Conditional Use Permit for the use of land or buildings as requested.
130
Approval: If the Planning Commission recommends approval of a conditional use permit
request, the Planning Commission shall send the request forward to the City Council for
action.
Disapproval: If a conditional use permit request is disapproved by the Planning Commission,
the petitioner may appeal such disapproval to the City Council in writing, stating why he
considers the Planning Commissions findings and decisions to be in error. Such appeal
shall be filed with the Designated Agent within thirty (30) days of the date the Planning
Commission disapproves the conditional use permit request. A public hearing sign
announcing the appeal must be posted on the property no later than 7 days prior to the City
Council meeting at which the appeal will be heard. The applicant shall obtain the sign from
the Conway Planning Department and shall pay a fee as established by the City of Conway
for the sign. The fee is not refundable and the sign is not required to be returned.
(Ordinance O-07-73) If such a request is not appealed, the decision of the Planning
Commission shall be final and no further action on the request shall take place. (Ordinance
No. O-03-51)

the conditional use. Such action may be necessary to ensure that the conditional use is
compatible with surrounding property to better carry out the intent of this Ordinance.
H. The Planning Commission and City Council shall in no case authorize less than minimum

(10)The size and shape of the site, including size, shape and arrangement of proposed
structures shall be in keeping with the intent of this Ordinance.
K. Conditions

effect. Violation of any condition imposed shall constitute grounds for revocation of the
conditional use authorization. Time limits may be set for exercise of such authorization,
otherwise, any exercise of authorization must commence within a reasonable time length.
No authorized conditional use may be subsequently applied for a variance to the Board of
Adjustment. All amendments or changes to a conditional use authorization must follow the
same process as was followed by the original conditional use. No building permit shall be
issued except in conformance with provision of this Section.
L. Fee
The fee for any application for a conditional use permit shall be one hundred dollars
($100.00) three hundred twenty-five dollars ($325.00), no part of which shall be refundable.

Any person, firm or corporation who violates or refuses to comply with any of the provisions of
this Ordinance shall be fined not less than twenty dollars ($20), nor more than one hundred
dollars ($100) for each offense. Each day that a violation is permitted to exist shall constitute a
separate offense.
If any building or structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted,

authorities of the City may institute appropriate legal action or other remedies to prevent the
unlawful action.

the recommendation of the Planning Commission, on its own motion, or on petition from a
property owner. Before action is taken in regard to any amendment of the Ordinance, the
Planning Commission shall have reviewed the case and given a recommendation. However,

ordinances and resolutions by a vote of the majority of the Council.
132

MOVING OF BUILDINGS
SECTION 1001.1  PERMIT REQUIRED
It is hereby declared unlawful for any person, persons, firm, company, or corporation to move
any building in the City of Conway from one place to another upon the same lot, or from one
place in the city to another place in the city not upon the same lot, or from without the city into
the city, without first securing a permit to do so from the City Council.
However, the Designated Agent of the Mayor may grant a building permit for a portable
building if said building or structure meets the following criteria, and other requirements of this
ordinance.
A portable building as used in this section of this ordinance shall mean any building or structure
not designed for full time occupancy, with no sleeping quarters and no installed electrical wiring
or receptacles and no plumbing facilities and so designed as to be transported after fabrication,
arriving at the site of location as a fully assembled structure not more than 160 square feet in
area and not more than sixteen (16) feet in its greatest dimension.
Such building shall be deemed an Accessory Building and will be subject to the conditions
applying to uses in Section 601.2 of the Zoning Ordinance. Such building shall further comply
with all requirements set forth in this ordinance for the zoning district into which said building or
structure is placed.
However, the Mayor and Designated Agent may grant a 90 day permit to locate a temporary or
portable building or office within the City of Conway. However, the provisions of Section 1001.2
 Applications do not apply to this 90 day permit, but application for such permit shall be made
direct to Designated Agent and Mayor for approval and issuance of permit.
SECTION 1001.2  APPLICATIONS
All applications for a relocation permit to move any building shall be made in writing to the
Designated Agent, not less than seventeen (17) days prior to the required public hearing, on a
form furnished by said Agent, and shall contain the following information:
(a) Description of type of building to be moved.
(b) Present location of building.

(h) Such other information as may reasonably be required in order to carry out the purposes
of this Section.
If, upon review of the application, the Designated Agent can reasonably determine that the
building or structure meets requirements of a portable building as defined in this ordinance, then
a building permit may be granted and no building moving fee will be charged. If this
determination cannot be made by the Designated Agent, the application will be forwarded to the
City Planning Commission for action as set out in this ordinance for the moving of other
buildings and structures.
SECTION 1001.3  FEES
Before any application for a relocation permit is forwarded to the City Planning Commission an
application fee shall be paid by the applicant to the Designated Agent to cover the cost of
investigation and inspection. The application fee shall be thirty-five dollars ($35.00) three
hundred twenty-five dollars ($325.00) (Ordinance No. O-07-121) for any building located within
the City of Conway. For any building located outside the City of Conway, the application fee
shall be thirty-five dollars ($35.00) plus one dollar ($1.00) for each mile, or fraction thereof,
when the building to be moved is located beyond the city limits of the City of Conway three

SECTION 1101.3  PROCEDURES FOR DEVELOPMENT REVIEW
Overview. The time frame required for development approval will rely mainly on the size of the
project, the quality of the plans submitted, and the time the City awaits re-submittal of plan
corrections and revisions. The City of Conway makes no guarantee or representation as to any
period of time which may be necessary in order to review and/or approve a given development
plan. Submittals will be reviewed on a first come, first served basis, but always in a timely
manner.
A. Preliminary Conference
All applicants, or a representative thereof, are required to meet at least once prior to
application submittal with a representative from the Planning Department to discuss basic
plan requirements, existing site features, architectural design, concurrency with other
projects in the surrounding area, compliance with the Comprehensive and Master Street
Plans, neighboring traffic patterns, and/or any other factors which may impact or be
impacted by the proposed development. It is advised that the applicant bring drawings
and/or photographs depicting the proposed layout, building material samples, as well as any
existing features of the property, to include all structures and vegetation. The applicant may
desire more than one conference, whether prior to or after application submittal.
B. Development Review Submittal
The following items are required for Development Review Approval:
1. A Plat of Record for the property being developed, filed with the Faulkner County
Circuit Clerk, and in accordance with City of Conway Subdivision Ordinance (O-00-
03).
2. A completed and signed Development Review Application (Form No. DR-03)
3. A completed Development Review Checklist (Form No. DR-04)
4. All site development plans
5. Verification of payment of all associated fees, bonds, charges, and debts
6. Any required traffic engineering study, as determined by the City engineer
7. General statement of character and intent of use of the development
8. Submissions must include all supporting documentation, including, but not limited to
the following: variances, deeds, access agreements, and conditional use permits.
143
Submissions must be made to the City of Conway Planning Department at any time the
Planning Department is open for business.
C. Planning Department Staff Review
Development will be reviewed for both general and specific standards, along with all federal,
state, county, and city regulations that can be reviewed at the City level. The Planning
Department has ten (10) working days from the application date to conduct a preliminary
review and then provide the applicant a response.
SECTION 1101.4  DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL & PERMITTING
A. Approved development plans are valid for twenty-four (24) months from the date of
approval. If after that period of time, all necessary permits for construction are not yet
obtained, the Development Plan Approval shall be considered null and void. Upon plan
expiration, plans are required to be re-submitted for review. Re-submittal of an expired plan
shall require evaluation as if the project were new, to include current standards, regulations,
and conditions in the area, as well as payment of all fees in accordance with current fee
schedule. Extensions may be granted annually by the Planning Director only so long as no
change to the previously approved Development Plan is desired.
B. No building permit shall be issued for any development subject to Development Review prior
to approval of the site plan.
C. Failure to build-out the development according to the approved drawings, information, plans,
documents, or any and all approved amendments thereto shall render the development
approval and the building permit null and void. The Planning Director shall have final
authority to determine if the development conforms to all approved elements of the site plan.
D. The Permits and Inspections Department shall reserve the right to deny or revoke the issue
of the Certificate of Occupancy for any structure on a given site when any part of that site
does not comply with the approved site plan.
E. In the event that a landowner wishes to abandon an approved development plan or any
section thereof, said landowner should so notify the Planning Director in writing.
SECTION 1101.5  DEVELOPMENT REVIEW APPEALS
All appeal requests shall be submitted by use of a Development Review Notice of Appeal (DR-
05), available from the Planning Department. All appeals shall be respectful of only the specific
regulation(s), standard(s), or guideline(s) outlined in this Article which preclude the approval of a
given development plan. Those items shall be identified by the Planning Director and detailed
within form DR-05. No additional considerations regarding this Article or its content shall be
made at any time during the Appeals process.
A. Disapproval of a development by the Planning Director may be appealed to the Planning
Commission by the property owner by filing a Notice of Appeal with the Planning
Department within thirty (30) days following the Planning Directors decision. The appeal will
be placed on the agenda of the next Planning Commission meeting occurring no less than
seventeen (17) days after the date of appeal.
B. Disapproval of a development plan by the Planning Commission may be appealed to the
City Council by the property owner by filing a Notice of Appeal with the Planning Department
within thirty (30) days following the Planning Commissions decision. The appeal will be
placed on the agenda of the next City Council meeting occurring no less than eleven (11)
days after the date of appeal.
C. The Planning Commission and/or the City Council may grant an appeal prescribed by this
Section if, on the basis of evidence submitted within the development plan and the Notice of
144
Appeal, the Commission and/or Council makes the determination that the circumstances
detailed in subparagraphs 1, 2, or 3 listed below, as well as all guidelines provided by
Section 1101.6 below, do apply:
1. The design principles and/or architectural integrity of an established neighborhood
are not diminished or substantially changed based upon the proposed development,
or
2. The proposed development is in general conformity with the predominant style or is
reasonably compatible with a theme of styles present in the neighborhood, or
3. The neighborhood is deemed to be transitory in nature, thereby becoming one in
which the proposed design or architectural style, if reasonably believed to be
replicated within the neighborhood, may lead to a subsequent predominant style.
D. Following approval of the development plan by the Planning Director or the Planning
Commission or the City Council, construction may proceed if all other City requirements
have been met.
E. A Development Review Appeal Fee of two-hundred and fifty dollars ($250) shall be
submitted with the Development Review Notice of Appeal.
SECTION 1101.6  GENERAL DEVELOPMENT REVIEW GUIDELINES
This Section sets forth various aesthetic and functional provisions with the intention of serving
as a general guide to development within the City. During the course of Development Review,
plans shall be reviewed to determine if the development proposal demonstrates a satisfactory
quality of design in its structures and its site, the appropriateness of the building or buildings to
the intended use, and the harmony of the development to its surroundings. Satisfactory design
quality and harmony pertain to, among other things:
A. A site which is capable of accommodating the proposed development.
B. Ensuring that proper attention is paid to site and architectural design, thereby protecting
land values.
C. A plan for the site that is consistent with the Citys generally accepted practices and goals of
land use planning, site engineering, aesthetic design principles, and landscaping.
D. Encouraging development which is in keeping with the desired character of the City, the
desired character of a given neighborhood, and/or specific design attributes identified in
area plans adopted by the City (overlay districts, historic districts, etc.).
E. Ensuring physical, visual, and functional compatibility between uses.
F. Landscaping that not only meets City standards, but also serves to enhance the visual
appearance of the City, provide transition zones between varying land uses, break up large
areas of impervious surface, create a barrier to and relief from traffic, noise, heat, glare, and
odor, and promote energy efficiency and conservation in site design and building
construction.
G. Ingress, egress, internal traffic circulation, off-street parking facilities, cross accesses, and
pedestrian and cyclist ways that are designed so as to promote safety and convenience,
conform to approved city standards, and enhance curb appeal.
H. An adequate street system to provide access to the project without unduly stressing the
carrying capacity of that system.
I. A plan that represents an overall development pattern that is consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan, the Master Street Plan and other adopted planning policies.
The Planning Director may apply the above General Design Guidelines with some flexibility in
their application to specific projects, as not all design criteria may be workable or appropriate for
each project. In some circumstances, one guideline may be relaxed to facilitate compliance with
another guideline determined by the review authority to be more critical in that particular case.
145
Designers and developers are urged to recognize that the guidelines, regulations, and
recommendations detailed throughout this document are minimum standards and true
excellence may lie beyond them. No claim can be made that the following standards
encompass every possible technique for achieving a high level of design quality. The
designer is encouraged to use his or her own creativity, judgment, and experience to
improve upon these methods, not simply to achieve individual objectives, but also make
a positive contribution to the City.
SECTION 1101.7  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
In order to achieve the above listed General Development Review Guidelines, the following
standards shall apply to all developments subject to Development Review:
A. Site Characteristics and General Requirements
1. The development should conform to the extent appropriate to the natural topography
of the site. Site clearing shall be kept to the minimum required for the construction of
and/or improvements to the site, taking into consideration the need for vehicle,
cyclist, and pedestrian safety as well as the need for light and air.
2. Developments requiring hillside excavation shall adhere to all standards of
Ordinance O-06-67, and all amendments.
3. Projects adjacent to parks, plazas, and other public outdoor amenities should be
oriented toward those areas.
4. Generally accepted best practices shall be adhered to in order to prevent soil erosion
and siltation of the given sites watershed.
5. Natural vegetation should be retained to supplement the required landscaping to the
extent required, possible, and reasonable.
6. The site should be of such a character so that it can be used safely for the
construction and occupation of the proposed development and not create any
conditions which would involve danger to health, safety, and welfare.
7. Smoke, soot, particulates, and/or other discharges into the air shall not exceed the
levels established by any State or Federal environmental agencies.
8. While construction of and/or improvements to the site are in process, noise levels at
property boundaries should not exceed the given sites ambient levels except for
reasonably short periods of time. Furthermore, the City Engineer may prescribe
specific routes for the ingress and egress of dumptrucks, haulers, and other pieces
of construction equipment which may otherwise create an adverse impact to the
traffic flow along adjacent corridors.
B. Site Coverage
A maximum of 80% of the development site may be covered by impervious surface. This
number is derived by adding the total gross floor area (GFA) with the total lot coverage area
(LCA), as measured in square footage (ft²), then dividing that sum by the site area (ft²). The
formula is detailed below:
(GFA + LCA) ÷ Site Area = Percent Impervious Surface (%)
A minimum of 20% of the total area of the site, as measured in square footage (ft²), shall
permanently remain a pervious surface. The C-1 Central Business District is exempt from
this requirement
146
C. Standards and Concepts for Design and Architecture
During the Development Review process, the Planning Director will conduct an assessment
of various design and architectural elements which may include, but not be limited to the
following:
1. Massing and harmony
a. Developments which encompass more than one building should incorporate
a recurring, unifying, and identifiable theme for the entire development site.
b. Development shall support the desired character of the City, the favored
theme of a given neighborhood, and/or specific design attributes identified in
given areas or districts. It is generally encouraged that in residential areas
structures utilize pitched roofs similar to those on most homes, whereas in
urban areas flat roofs are more appropriate.
c. Key design elements and how they relate to those of surrounding buildings
including, but not limited to windows, doors, façade design, detailing, roof
forms, exterior materials, and colors, all with area ratios and proportions
similar to those on adjoining buildings.
d. Non-residential buildings sharing street frontage with residentially developed
properties should maintain a residential character.
2. Size and shape
a. Buildings shall avoid long uninterrupted façade planes and/or blank walls.
The façade planes of the exterior walls shall be varied in depth and/or
direction.
i. The maximum permitted length of an uninterrupted façade plane shall
be thirty-five (35) feet for buildings twenty-thousand (20,000) square
feet or less.
ii. The maximum permitted length of an uninterrupted façade plane shall
be fifty (50) feet for buildings greater than twenty-thousand (20,000)
square feet.
iii. The maximum permitted length of an uninterrupted façade plane shall
be one hundred (100) feet for buildings greater than fifty-thousand
(50,000) square feet.
iv. Differing colors (other than paint),materials, and textures, when used
in concert with one another, may be considered façade interruptions.
In addition to vertical elements such as pilasters, horizontal façade
elements are required to create more interesting and pleasing building
facades. These horizontal elements can be created through the use
of color or paint, differing textured masonry materials and/or masonry
coursing bonds. Contrasting colors and/or paint changes shall be
used (except as outlined in the next sentence) along with differing
masonry surface treatments or textures. Differing raised masonry
surfaces in higher value masonry such as brick, stone, or cast stone
can be used to create horizontal banding. When using lower value
masonry such as split face block or precision block substantially
contrasting colors shall be used even with raised surfaces or
textures. However, color or paint variation alone is not sufficient in
creating the desired horizontal features. (O-16-136)
v. In addition to the above horizontal elements, architectural treatments
may include, but not be limited to, windows, doors, pilasters,
variations in the roof line or parapet wall, archways, columns, building
wall recesses, and wall projections. These types of treatment shall be
used to break up the mass of a single building into distinct
147
components, while continuing to maintain an overall rhythm similar to
surrounding buildings. (O-16-136)
b. Architectural treatments which may include, but not be limited to, windows
and doors, pilasters, variations in the roof line or parapet wall, archways and
columns, and building wall recesses. These types of treatment shall be used
to break up the mass of a single building into distinct components, while
continuing to maintain an overall rhythm similar to surrounding buildings.
3. Façade characteristics
a. Exterior construction materials shall vary in type, form, and color
i. Metal siding, when used as the primary sheathing of the I, is
prohibited when visible from the public realm or residential areas.
Other forms of metal, when used as an architectural treatment or
aesthetic accent, may cover up to twenty percent (20%) of any
facade. Architectural metal percentages may be increased beyond
20% if the material is shown to be durable, aesthetically pleasing, and
a cost equivalent substitute for masonry materials. (O-16-136)
ii. Masonry shall occupy no less than 51% of any façade of any
structure. Brick or brick-like units should be the dominant masonry
material. Split face block or other textured concrete CMU block
should be used as a base or façade accent. Split face and textured
block is limited to no more than 25% of a wall face area. Durable fiber
cement board, cast concrete, poured concrete, stone, and cultured
stone materials are acceptable masonry materials. (O-16-136)
iii. Unpainted, unstained, and/or otherwise untreated precision concrete
block shall not be visible on any part of any exterior façade is
prohibited. Precision concrete block shall be limited to a decorative
use only not to exceed 10% of the wall façade area and can only be
used in contrasting horizontal bands. (O-16-136)
iv. All buildings should shall have a defined base and cap. (O-16-136)
b. Franchise architecture is strongly discouraged. Branding a structure
makes it difficult, if not impossible, to redevelop into another use.
i. Site-specific architectural design is desired. Rather than adapting a
standard design, floor plans and elevations that are unique to the
community and are not a corporate or franchise design are
encouraged by all developments. (O-16-136)
ii. The only franchise identifying feature should be minor façade details,
and the companys logo and signs.
iii. Please refer to Paragraphs B, C, and D of the General Design
Guidelines when making considerations.
c. To avoid a monolithic appearance, I design should attempt to break down
buildings into smaller sections, with each section varying in type, material,
and/or color.
i. Rear and side façades shall be similar to (but may be more modest
than) the primary I in their architectural treatment when visible from
the public realm or adjacent residential areas. A façade that is out o
view rom he public realm may used relaxed building standards;
however, any visible area shall be wrapped to the degree that
adjoining wall treatment is carried around the structures corner to
visibly hid any lank façade. (O-16-136)
ii. Blank walls visible from the public realm and residential areas shall
not be allowed are prohibited. Where blank wall sections are
148
unavoidable due to the requirements of a particular land use or
structural needs, they shall receive special design treatments up to at
least the finished ceiling height of the first floor building space in order
to increase visual appeal and interest. Methods to decrease blank
wall impact include, but are not limited to: lush vegetation in front of
the wall (such as a trellis with climbing vines or other planted
materials like evergreen trees and shrubs), enhanced decorative
masonry patterns, setbacks, projections, indentations, or intervals of
material change to break up a walls surface. These methods shall be
approved through the development review process. (O-16-136)
1) Lush vegetation in front of the wall (such as a trellis with
climbing vines or other planted materials like trees and shrubs)
which cover at least 50% of the blank wall surface.
2) Provide a decorative masonry pattern, or other architectural
feature, over at least thirty percent (30%) of the blank wall
surface.
3) Employ small setbacks, projections, indentations, or intervals
of material change to break up the walls surface.
4. Location with respect to natural topography and finish grade elevation.
D. Considerations for Traffic, Access, Parking, and Loading
1. Association, Relation, and Integration
a. The development plan shall take into account all public streets, highways,
and sidewalks which provide access to the site. The development shall be
designed so as to sufficiently and adequately provide for the safe ingress and
egress of all forms of traffic.
b. The traffic patterns on to, within, and off of the site shall be coordinated with
preexisting traffic patterns so as to compose a safe and convenient system.
c. There shall be proper arrangement of streets within the site and in relation to
other existing and planned streets (or with the features of the Comprehensive
Plan or Master Street Plan) such that the development of the site shall not
endanger public safety or welfare and shall promote public convenience and
prosperity.
d. There shall be access of adequate width from public rights-of-way to each
structure on the site for fire, police, and medical emergency vehicles and
personnel.
2. Access Requirements
In order to preserve the smooth flow of traffic along adjoining streets and
highways, the number of curb cuts allowed shall be limited. Furthermore,
driveway sharing shall be required for all properties abutting collector streets and
minor and major arterials, as identified by the Comprehensive Plan. The following
measurements shall be taken from the nearest respective edge of each curb cut,
driveway, or intersection.
a. Curb Cuts (Accesses)
i. Curb cuts shall be a minimum of twelve (12) feet in width and a
maximum of forty (40) feet in width
ii. Curb cuts shall be no less than one-hundred (100) feet apart.
iii. For lots having two-hundred and forty (240) feet of street frontage or
more, curb cuts shall be no less than one-hundred (100) feet from the
closest side lot line.
149
iv. No curb cut shall be within one hundred and twenty-five (125) feet of
any intersection.
v. Curb cuts shall be coordinated with existing or planned median
openings and shall, where possible and reasonable, line up with
driveways or streets on the opposite side of the roadway.
b. Joint Access
i. For lots having less than two hundred and forty (240) feet of street
frontage, joint access with the adjoining property owner(s) shall be
required.
ii. The two adjacent property owners shall enter into a joint-access
agreement whereupon they will share a single driveway which is
ideally, but not necessarily along their common property line.
iii. Parcels which cannot comply immediately due to undeveloped
adjoining property or lack of a preexisting joint-access agreement
and/or easement may be allowed a temporary curb cut at a location
designated by the Planning Director. This temporary curb cut shall be
contingent on the property owner providing all of the following:
1) A joint-access easement, depicted on the Site Plan, with a
width of no less than twelve (12) feet and no greater than forty
(40) feet.
2) A signed joint-access agreement with the deed allowing a
shared driveway or service drive along the desired adjoining
property line.
3) Record of a joint maintenance agreement defining
maintenance responsibilities of each property owner.
iv. Temporary curb cuts shall be closed provided that easements,
agreements, and improvements providing joint access are secured
upon future neighboring development.
c. Cross Access
i. All parking lots for non-residential properties shall have at least one
vehicular connection to all adjacent properties.
ii. A continuous service drive, or cross-access corridor, extending up to
the entire length of each block, shall be provided where necessary to
ensure that curb cut separation remains consistent with the standards
outlined in a. above.
iii. A design speed of 10 mph and sufficient width to accommodate twoway
travel aisles designed to accommodate automobiles, service
vehicles, and loading vehicles; required minimum width of twenty (20)
feet and maximum width of forty (40) feet.
iv. Stub-outs and other design features shall be required to make it
visually obvious that the abutting properties may be tied in to provide
cross access via a service drive. Stub-outs shall be required so that
cross access to abutting properties is insured.
v. All cross accesses should contain landscaping and/or other design
features to make them visually obvious to traffic as a service corridor.
vi. A unified access and circulation system plan that includes coordinated
or shared parking areas should be offered wherever feasible.
d. Shared drives shall be required where stipulated by any other City of Conway
ordinance(s), previously submitted cross-access and/or joint-access
agreements, and/or determinations made by the City engineer and Planning
Director.
150
e. Any access management requirements established by any other Federal,
State, local, regional, or City access management systems or agency must
be met.
3. Driveway Throat Length
a. Driveway entrances/exits shall be designed to prevent a back-up of vehicles
waiting to egress onto the adjacent street. The depth of the formal entrance
way, where vehicles may queue without interfering with traffic circulation, is
referred to as the throat length. The length of this throat is particularly
important for businesses that generate a high number of vehicle trips per day.
b. Throat length should be determined on a case-by-case basis, but generally
varies according to the number of trips generated by the land use and the
available area for constructing the driveway throat. A traffic impact study
based on peak hour demand is the best way to determine the extent of
potential queuing problems and how best to resolve them.
c. Due to the dynamic nature of traffic patterns, the Planning Director and/or
City Engineer working in coordination with the project engineer shall make all
driveway throat length determinations based upon the characteristics of each
given site.
4. Right Turn Deceleration Lanes
a. A dedicated right turn lane is often necessary when the right turn volume
exceeds 750 vehicle trip ends per day and/or the development fronts an
arterial with a speed limit greater than forty-five (45) mph.
b. In most cases, only moderate to large-scale developments would warrant a
right turn lane. However, certain circumstances may make the addition of a
deceleration lane necessary, even in situations where a development
generates less than 750 vehicle trip ends daily.
c. On lower volume driveways or in areas with limited right-of-way, tapers may
be required to help remove turning vehicles from the roadway more quickly.
Tapers may be most useful in rural areas, where speeds are high and
volumes low.
d. The Planning Director and/or City Engineer working in coordination with the
project engineer shall make this determination based upon the characteristics
of a given site.
5. Parking
a. Orientation
i. Parking areas located in the front setback or between the principal
structure and any public street, including corner lots are strongly
discouraged. Parking should be provided to the side and rear of the
building, with no more than one (1) parking aisle on the side of any
structure. Any available and allowed on-street parking shall be exempt
from this requirement.
ii. Continuous access, head-in parking is not permitted as off-street
parking. Vehicles shall not back out onto public streets.
iii. It is recommended that primary entry drives on large-scale
developments include a minimum six (6) foot wide landscaped median
to separate incoming and outgoing traffic.
b. Design
i. Parking lots shall be designed with a hierarchy of circulation:
1) Major access drives with no parking, framed by use of one or
more of the following: building facades, sidewalks, low walls,
trees, and/or shrubs. Maximum of forty (40) feet in width.
151
2) Major circulation aisles with little or no parking, generally
adjacent to the building(s) being served, and typically wide
enough to allow for drop-offs and pick-ups. Maximum of thirtyfour
(34) feet in width.
3) Narrower parking aisles to reduce speeds and allow for direct
access to parking spaces. Maximum of twenty (20) feet in
width.
ii. To break down large expanses of paved surface, parking areas with
greater than forty-eight (48) spaces shall be organized into a series of
smaller modules of no greater than forty-eight (48) spaces each.
Parking areas within large-scale developments may incorporate up to
96 spaces per module. These modules should be separated and
defined by circulation aisles and landscape strips and/or islands
consisting of trees and low shrubs.
iii. Bicycle Parking Space Size, Access Aisles, and Vertical Clearance
1) Required bicycle parking spaces shall be at least 2 feet by 6
feet each.
2) An access aisle of at least 5 feet shall be provided in each
bicycle parking facility.
3) Such areas shall have a vertical clearance of at least 6 feet.
iv. The Inverted U bike rack, at a minimum of thirty inches (30) in
width, shall be the required bicycle parking rack throughout the City of
Conway, although other racks may be proposed provided that they
meet the following performance requirements:
1) Support the frame of the bicycle and not just one wheel
2) Allow the frame and one wheel to be locked to the rack when
both wheels are left on the bike, as well as allow the frame and
both wheels to be locked to the rack if the front wheel is
removed
3) Allow the use of either a cable or U-shaped lock
4) Be securely anchored to the ground or building so as to
prevent the rack from being removed
5) The surfacing of such facilities shall be designed and
maintained to be mud and dust free.
c. Location of Parking areas
i. Off-street parking shall be located within one-thousand feet of the
structure to be served, measured as a straight line between the
nearest points of the parking area and the structure.
ii. Off-site Parking
1) If off-site parking areas are provided, they shall provide a
complete pedestrian infrastructure connecting the parking area
and the structure being served.
2) Off-site be located on property zoned to allow the same
principal use as said structure.
iii. All off-street parking areas shall have direct access to a street or alley.
iv. Bicycle parking areas shall be visible, secure, accessible, easy to use,
and convenient.
1) Cyclists should easily spot short-term parking when they arrive
from the street. A highly visible location discourages theft and
vandalism. Avoid locations off to the side or around the
corner.
152
2) The parking area should be convenient to building entrances
and street access, but away from normal pedestrian and auto
traffic. Avoid locations that require bicycles to travel over
stairs.
v. For security, locate bicycle parking within view of passers-by, retail
activity, or office windows. These areas should also be well lit for theft
protection, personal security, and accident prevention.
d. Required Spaces
The purpose of required parking is to provide a sufficient number of
spaces which accommodate the majority of traffic generated by the
range of uses which might locate at a given site over time. In response
to this long-term emphasis, the Citys required parking numbers
correspond to broad use categories, not specific uses.
i. Automobiles: category minimums and maximums
1) Residential
a) Minimum 1.5 spaces per dwelling unit
b) Maximum 2.0 spaces per dwelling unit
2) Lodging
a) Minimum 1.0 spaces per lodging room
b) Maximum 1.1 spaces per lodging room
3) Office/Institution
a) Minimum 2.8 spaces per 1,000 ft²
b) Maximum 4.2 spaces per 1,000 ft²
4) Retail/General Business
a) Minimum 3.4 spaces per 1,000 ft²
b) Maximum 4.8 spaces per 1,000 ft²
5) Restaurant
a) Minimum 9 spaces per 1,000 ft²
b) Maximum 12 spaces per 1,000 ft²
6) Industry
a) Minimum 0.6 spaces per 1,000 ft²
b) Maximum 1.8 spaces per 1,000 ft²
ii. Deductions shall be applied to the above requirements for structures
exceeding 10,000 square feet
1) 10,001 ft² - 20,000 ft² = 95% total
2) 20,001 ft² - 30,000 ft² = 90% total
3) 30,001 ft² - 40,000 ft² = 85% total
4) 40,001 ft² - unlimited = 80% total
iii. On-street parking is generally recommended, except on collector
streets and above.
1) Any on-street parking spaces located between the two side lot
lines of the site and along the same side as the structure being
served shall be counted to satisfy all parking requirements.
2) All parking within the public right-of-way shall be considered
public parking and maintain no signage or signal which
indicates otherwise.
iv. Bicycles: category minimums and maximums
1) Residential: minimum 1.0 space per dwelling unit
2) Lodging: minimum 0.1 spaces per lodging room
3) Office/Institution: minimum 1 space per 15 provided parking
spaces
153
4) Retail/General Business: minimum 1 space per 15 provided
parking spaces
5) Restaurant: minimum 1 space 15 provided parking spaces
6) Industry: minimum 1 space per 25 provided parking spaces
7) In all cases where bicycle parking is required, no fewer than
two (2) spaces shall be required.
8) After the first thirty (30) bicycle spaces are provided, additional
spaces required shall be reduced by one-half (0.5) the
aforementioned standards.
v. When certain instances warrant interpretation or refinement based
upon specific parking needs, a comprehensive assessment shall be
made by the Planning Director, City Traffic Engineer, and/or the
Bicycle Advisory Board Program Manager in order to provide a more
accurate parking requirement.
e. Overflow Parking
i. Additional overflow parking spaces may be approved by the
Planning Director for overflow events and seasonal demands, and
based upon adequate reasoning.
ii. All surface parking spaces provided in excess of the maximum
requirement shall be pervious in nature.
1) These parking and access lanes shall use alternate pervious
materials (geotextile-reinforced grass areas, mulch-covered
gridblocks, porous paving materials, etc.) for the entire
overflow area.
2) Standard, non-porous asphalt or concrete, or other impervious
materials, shall not be permitted within the overflow area.
f. Minimum Parking Space and Maneuver Area Dimensions
i. Parallel Spaces
1) Width: 22 Feet
2) Depth: 8 Feet
3) Maneuver Area: 12 Feet
ii. Angled Spaces (45º to 60º)
1) Width: 9 Feet
2) Depth: 18 Feet
3) Maneuver Area: 18 Feet
iii. Right Angle Spaces (90º)
1) Width: 9 Feet
2) Depth: 20 Feet
3) Maneuver Area: 20 Feet
NOTE: Right angle parking spaces shall not be permitted for use
as on-street parking.
iv. For on-street parking, the street travel lane immediately adjacent to
the parking space(s) shall be regarded as the maneuver area.
g. Shared Parking
i. In areas where there are two or more differing principal uses, shared
parking areas by neighboring properties are highly encouraged and
shall be permitted in order to reduce the number of required parking
spaces.
ii. Shared parking requirements may be further reduced if peak demand
periods for proposed land uses do not occur during the same general
time periods (i.e. a church and a school).
154
iii. A convenient, visible pedestrian connection between all shared
parking areas must be provided and maintained.
iv. The availability of off-site parking for all participating developments
shall be indicated by directional signs as permitted by Article 1301 of
the City of Conway Zoning Ordinance.
v. Property owners must enter into a Shared Parking Agreement.
1) Each party identifies specific requirements and maintenance
responsibilities. (A Shared Parking Agreement format may be
obtained by contacting the Planning Department.)
2) This Agreement shall be permanent in nature, approved by the
Planning Director, recorded on the title records of each
affected property, and filed with both the Faulkner County
Circuit Clerks Office and the Conway Planning Department.
h. Pedestrian Circulation
i. Avoid placing primary vehicle access in close proximity to major
building entries in order to minimize pedestrian and vehicular conflicts.
ii. Clearly defined pedestrian walkways or paths should be provided from
parking areas to primary building entrances. Design walkways and
parking lots so that pedestrians will not have to cross parking aisles
and landscape islands to reach building entries.
iii. Raised walkways, decorative paving, landscaping, and/or bollards
should be used to separate pedestrians from vehicular circulation to
the maximum extent possible. Textured paving should be provided at
crosswalks within the project as opposed to a painted stripe
designation provided it does not conflict with ADA access
requirements.
iv. Areas in and around buildings should be designed with the pedestrian
in mind. Landscaping and pedestrian scaled elements such as
awnings or trellises should be integrated into the elevation and the
passageway should be safely lit.
i. Surfacing
i. All parking areas shall be paved with a sealed surface pavement or
concrete.
1) Shall be designed and constructed in accordance with Chapter
9.04 Minimum Standards for Construction of the Conway
Municipal Code.
2) Shall be maintained so as to prevent dust resulting from
continued use.
ii. Parking areas shall provide necessary drainage infrastructure and be
graded so as to dispose of all surface water which may otherwise
accumulate in the area.
NOTE: Stormwater runoff from urban impervious surfaces is now
the leading cause of nonpoint source (NPS) pollution. Parking lots
collect grease, oil, antifreeze, and other vehicle leakage; heavy
metals from brake dust; as well as litter, other debris, and
pathogens. All of these pollutants are flushed into local waterways
by rain and melting snow. The City of Conway is committed to the
reduction of NPS pollution. Developers are strongly encouraged to
contact the Planning Department to inquire about the various
methods available for reducing the detrimental effects NPS
pollutants have on our watershed.
155
iii. All parking areas and areas for internal circulation on the site shall be
physically delineated by curbing so as to protect adjacent vegetation.
j. All requirements established under Article 501 or the City of Conway
Ordinance No. O-94-54 not superseded by this Article shall remain in effect
and applied during Development Review.
6. Traffic Study
a. The City Engineer may review the development plan to determine if the
developer shall be required to provide a traffic engineering study to include,
at a minimum, recommendations for on-site and off-site improvements.
b. If such a study is required, it must be submitted, reviewed and approved
subject to completion of any needed improvements, prior to approval of the
site plan. Approval shall be dependent upon the study showing that the
project, with all necessary improvements, will not be the contributing factor in
the connecting road system being reduced to a level of service lower than C
(as identified by American Association of State Highway and Transportation
Officials).
c. All traffic engineering studies shall be conducted at the developers expense.
7. Passenger/Cargo Loading and Unloading Areas
All loading and service areas shall be designed so as not to interfere with other
planned circulation on the site and so as to provide adequate space and facilities.
E. Mechanical and Utility Equipment
1. All mechanical and utility equipment located on the wall, roof, and/or on the ground
shall be screened from view when visible from the public realm or residential areas.
2. All roof-mounted utilities and mechanical equipment shall be screened all on sides
(360°) by incorporating screening into the structure utilizing materials compatible
with the supporting building.
3. Mechanical equipment over forty-eight (48) inches in height shall meet building
setbacks.
4. All mechanical equipment shall be screened in a method sufficient enough to ensure
that no adjacent properties are negatively affected by noise generated by the
equipment. This is especially critical when projects abut residential uses.
5. Wherever possible, transformers should be placed in a location which maximizes
safety and minimizes visual impacts, such as in the side or rear yard. When an ideal
location cannot be achieved, the transformers shall be well screened. NOTE: Ten
feet of unobstructed clearance shall be provided for transformer door(s) with five (5)
feet of clearance along non-door sides.
6. Other equipment, such as gas meters, electrical meters, cable boxes, junction boxes,
irrigation controllers, and roof access ladders, shall be located within a designated
utility area. Where this location cannot be achieved, these features shall be designed
as an integral part of the building on a rear or side elevation and screened from
public view.
7. Reduced pressure zone assemblies (backflow preventers) for landscape irrigation
and domestic water shall not be located at visually prominent locations or shall be
well-screened with shrubs, berming, or low screen walls.
8. Where utility screening measures interfere with any maintenance or servicing needs,
it may be removed at the landowner expense. All screening measures shall meet
standards and approval of the respective utility company.
NOTE: All fire hydrants, risers, and alarm panels are exempt from these
provisions, and will be located and approved per City of Conway Fire Department
requirements.
156
F. Trash, Refuse, and Recyclable Material Storage
1. All attempts should be made to locate storage areas along the side or in the rear of
structures where additional screening can be provided by the structure itself.
Locating storage areas in front of the primary façade is strongly discouraged.
2. All trash, refuse, and recyclable materiel container areas shall be enclosed and/or
screened. In no event shall any trash containers be placed within a public street
right-of-way or other public property for any length of time more than that required to
service them.
3. Buildings located less than fifteen (15) feet from the rear and side lot lines shall
include a trash container room for the purpose of housing trash containers and shall
be constructed according to the following:
a. The container room shall be located only in the side or rear of a building and
shall be easily accessible for servicing.
b. The container room shall be fully enclosed.
9. Buildings located more than fifteen feet from the rear and side lot lines shall include
either a trash container room (as required above), or a trash container (dumpster)
enclosure constructed according to the following:
a. A 15x15 prepared surface of 4 reinforced concrete on which the containers will
rest, and a 10x15 skirt of 8 reinforced concrete on which the trucks will rest
during servicing.
b. Enclosure walls on three sides at a minimum of six feet in height and a gate or
gates, substantial enough to fully screen the containers within, shall be required.
The gate(s) shall be designed with both aesthetics and ease of service in mind.
c. The entire enclosure shall be constructed or otherwise treated in a manner so as
to correspond to or blend with the structure(s) being served (i.e. brick building =
brick enclosure). Enclosures consisting of wood or plastic are strongly
discouraged in all cases, as they are often prone to higher maintenance needs.
d. All such dumpster pads shall require approval by the Conway Sanitation
Department.
e. A paved surface shall be provided between the trash container enclosure and the
street from which the container will be serviced.
f. Containers and enclosures shall be located so as to allow ease of access for
collection vehicles. No parking or other obstruction shall be permitted in the
access area for enclosures. With the exception of in the narrowest of alleyways,
containers shall be located so as to prevent trash collection trucks from blocking
traffic while servicing them.
g. Containers and enclosures shall be constructed and situated so that they do not
cause nuisance or offense to abutters. Trash enclosures located within twentyfive
(25) feet of any residential areas and/or public right-of-way shall include a
screen or solid cover to prevent odor and wind-blown litter.
4. The current property owner shall bear the responsibility of maintenance.
a. The property owner shall be responsible for maintaining all trash container
rooms and enclosures within the boundaries of the site so as to present a
healthy, neat, and litter-free appearance.
b. Any rooms or enclosures which are in a state of disrepair shall be repaired or
replaced within the ensuing thirty (30) day period, from the date of notice, in
accordance to the approved development plan.
5. Trash container rooms and enclosures may be shared upon evidence of the abutters
agreement to do so. Property owners must enter into a Shared Sanitation Service
157
Agreement, whereupon each party identifies requirements and maintenance
responsibilities.
G. Service, Loading, and Storage Areas
1. All service, loading, and storage areas shall be located and concentrated where they
will not create a nuisance for adjacent uses by projection of light, noise, and/or visual
clutter.
2. Loading facilities should be located as far as possible from the street and adjacent
properties and should not be located in areas visible from any adjacent public or
private street, unless screened appropriately.
3. Loading facilities shall be designed as an integral part of the building served and be
in the most inconspicuous location.
4. Service and loading areas should be located and designed for easy access by
service vehicles, for convenient access by each tenant, and to minimize circulation
conflicts with other site uses.
5. Public circulation should not route through loading or service areas. A service yard,
by definition, precludes public circulation through it.
6. Service and roll-up doors shall be painted to match the building or trim.
7. Public circulation should not route through loading or service areas. If located
adjacent to a residential or institutional area, the following measures shall be taken:
a. A minimum landscaped setback of twenty (20) feet shall be provided between
the service yard (nearest curb) and the property line.
b. A fence or wall shall be built to screen the service yard and shall be
constructed to the following standards:
i. Be of a durable material (i.e. brick or stone masonry, wood, iron,
composite, etc.).
ii. Be a minimum five (5) feet in height. The final height shall be
determined by the Planning Director based upon specific site criteria
so that the intent of this Article is met.
iii. The fence or wall shall avoid a stockade appearance.
iv. Fences and walls should be designed with materials and finishes that
complement project architecture.
v. Fences and walls shall be aesthetically and functionally enhanced
through the incorporation of columns and piers, vegetation along their
base, and random variation in plane and direction of at least five (5)
feet for every fifty (50) feet of length.
vi. Located to provide an unobstructed landscape strip along the
outside of the wall or fence (between it and the adjoining residential
or institutional property)
1) Minimum six (6) feet in width
2) Landscaped to the standard of the Interior of Property Lines
paragraph of this Article. Generous vegetation is encouraged
to soften the appearance and to aid in the prevention of graffiti.
3) All maintenance shall be the responsibility of respective
property owners. Low-maintenance vegetation is strongly
encouraged.
8. Where appropriate, service yards shall include provisions for loading areas, trash
containers, storage areas, utility equipment, maintenance equipment or vehicles.
9. All such areas shall be exempt from interior landscaping requirements, but not from
setback, perimeter landscaping, and/or pertinent screening requirements.
158
H. Fences
1. Razor and/or barbed wire
Razor and/or barbed wire fences are prohibited if visible from public right-of-way
or a residential area, except barbed wire used for agricultural purposes (should
never be used unless it is needed to solve a demonstrated security problem).
2. Chain Link
Chain link fencing shall not be closer to any adjacent street than any structure on
the site. All chain link fencing shall be painted or coated in a non-obtrusive color,
such as black or dark green, in order to diminish its visual impact.
3. In Front of Buildings
Any fencing or walls located between the primary structures and any public rightof-
way, including those used as a retaining measure, may only be solid up to
forty-eight (48) inches in height. Any fencing which exceeds forty-eight (48)
inches in height shall not obstruct the view of the primary structure from the right
of way. .
I. Landscaping
The goals of these landscaping requirements are: To enhance the visual appearance of
the City; to maintain and protect property values; to provide a better transition between
and improve the compatibility of abutting and nearby land uses, particularly as it
concerns residential neighborhoods which are adjacent to or in the vicinity of business
districts; to provide, within and on the perimeter of parking areas, landscaping that
facilitates safe movement of all forms of traffic, breaks up large areas of impervious
surface, and provides shade; to assure throughout the City, appropriate barriers to and
relief from traffic, noise, heat, glare, and odor; to improve air quality; and to promote
energy efficiency and conservation in site design, building construction, and
landscaping.
The incorporation of plazas, courtyards, pedestrian malls, and other outdoor spaces for
people to gather is highly encouraged in all developments.
NOTE: The planting of trees and shrubs may be postponed until the next following
planting season. For trees and shrubs, it is recommended that all planting be done
during the months of March, April, May, September, October, and November.
159
1. General Requirements
a. All areas not covered by structures, service yards, walkways, driveways, and
parking spaces shall be landscaped.

suitable drainage.
i. Trees, shrubs, groundcover, and grass shall be placed and/or
retained in such a manner as to reduce runoff and/or erosion.
ii. Graded areas shall be re-vegetated to ensure erosion control by
seeding, mulching, and fertilizing. Disturbed areas shall be planted
with suitable plant materials.
iii. Landscape fabric or erosion blankets should be provided on slopes
exceeding fifty percent (50%) while ground cover is being established.
c. The current property owner shall properly maintain all required landscaping.
i. The property owner shall be responsible for maintaining all
landscaping within the boundaries of the site so as to present a
healthy, neat, and orderly appearance.
ii. Any unhealthy or dead plant material shall be replaced within the
ensuing year in accordance to the approved landscaping plan.
d. Native species should be used when possible, in order to minimize watering.
e. Conway Corporation shall be consulted for all Landscape Plans which
propose plantings within utility easements.
2. Preservation
a. It is strongly encouraged the all landscaping plans attempt to incorporate
existing on-site landscape features and vegetation.
b. Preservation shall be the first, best, and standard approach.
i. All existing landscape features and vegetation shall be displayed on a
sketch or drawing to be submitted with Development Review
application.
ii. Concerned parties shall discuss methods for preserving these
identified features during the Preliminary Conference.
c. Where possible and reasonable, existing mature, significant trees, rock
outcroppings, and riparian corridors shall be preserved and incorporated into
landscape plans.
d. Where healthy plant material exists on the site prior to development and the
provision is made to preserve and incorporate that plant material on a
permanent basis, then credit may be given against all pertinent City
landscaping requirements, so long as the existing plant material meets the
purpose and intent of said requirements.
3. Structure Landscaping Requirements
a. There should be a landscape strip around the base of all structures on the
site. This strip should have a minimum width of three feet, exclusive of
sidewalks or driveways which cross at a generally perpendicular angle.
b. It is encouraged that any strip be planted with vegetation dense enough to
sufficiently lessen the impact of an otherwise bulky appearance where a
structure meets the ground. This is typically based upon the overall bulk of
the structure. The structure landscaping strip should be increased in width
and planting density as necessary to meet its intent. This is most often based
upon the overall bulk and scale of the structure.
4. Sign Landscaping Requirements
a. There shall be a landscaped area around the base of all ground-mounted
signs for the site (typically the monument and two-pole styles, regardless of
160
being off-premise or on-premise). This strip shall have a minimum width of
either four (4) feet or one-half (1/2) the sign height, whichever is greater.
b. It is required that the strip be planted with vegetation dense enough to
sufficiently lessen the impact of an otherwise bulky appearance where the
sign meets the ground.
c. The sign landscaping strip should be increased in width and planting density
as necessary to meet its intent. This is most often based upon the overall
bulk and scale of the sign.
5. Site Perimeter Landscaping Requirement
The perimeter of a site shall be landscaped to provide a buffer for adjacent uses
as well as an attractive view from the street. This area shall be required along the
full length of all site setbacks. No parking or paving shall be permitted within this
landscape buffer except sidewalks and driveways. Any driveways must cross the
buffer at a generally perpendicular angle.
a. Street Frontages

average lot depth, whichever is greater, shall be provided along all
property lines abutting any street, exclusive of right-of-way. The
maximum width for any project shall be 40 feet.
ii. Trees shall be planted at the ratio of no less than one (1) canopy tree
for every thirty (30) feet of property line abutting any street. In the
event overhead obstructions exist which would prohibit the use of
canopy trees, understory trees shall be required.
b. Interior Lot of Property Lines
i. A perimeter landscape strip at least six (6) feet in width shall be
provided along all property lines adjoining nonresidential areas. This
provision is waived where neighboring structures adjoin, such as with
strip centers.
ii. A perimeter landscape strip at least twenty (20) feet in width shall be
provided along all property lines adjoining any residential area.
iii. There shall be at least one (1) canopy tree every thirty (30) feet, one
(1) decorative tree every fifteen (15) feet, or one (1) shrub every six
(6) feet along all boundaries of the site which do not abut streets. Up
to twenty-five percent (25%) of these plantings may be grouped,
where desired.
iv. Existing vegetation which meets, in whole or in part, the purposes of
perimeter landscaping described above, may be applied toward these
requirements.
6. Parking Lot Landscaping and Screening
NOTE: Service, Loading, and Storage areas not visible from the public realm or
residential areas (generally those located in the rear of structures) shall be exempt
from the requirements set forth by this Paragraph.
a. Parking areas and cars should not be the dominant visual element of the site
or streetscape.
b. Trees shall be planted within the paved parking area so that each parking
space is no more than sixty (60) feet from the nearest tree. Perimeter trees
may be used to satisfy this requirement.
c. In parking lots with twenty-four (24) spaces or more, no more than twelve (12)
continuous parking spaces are permitted without a landscape island so as to
provide a ratio of no less than one (1) tree for each twelve (12) spaces
throughout the lot.
161
i. A landscape island shall be provided at the end of each parking lot
aisle.
ii. Each island shall contain at least one (1) tree. Each tree shall be
maintained to provide a minimum clearance of eight (8) feet at the
lowest limb.
iii. All islands shall be a minimum of one-hundred-and-fifty (150) square
feet of unobstructed landscape area.
iv. All islands shall be sodded, seeded, or mulched. Applicants are
required to plant additional shrubs, annuals, perennials, ornamental
grass, and/or groundcover.
v. All islands shall have a minimum unobstructed width of eight (8) feet.
vi. All islands shall be protected by a six (6) inch concrete curb.
d. In addition to the above, parking lots with two-hundred (200) or more parking
spaces shall be divided by landscape buffer areas to prevent large
expanses of asphalt.
i. With the exception of driveways which may cross them, these areas
shall extend the width or depth of the parking lot.
ii. This buffer shall be a minimum of twelve (12) feet wide, and include a
pedestrian walkway of no less width than six (6) feet bisecting it.
iii. A typical screening measure, such as a hedgerow or trees, should be
instituted along both sides of the walkway to provide a buffer to
pedestrians.
e. Internal landscaping should be aligned to create green edges necessary to
define access, circulation, and parking areas.
f. All parking lots shall be screened in order to ensure that no light trespass or
glare is directed onto surrounding residential properties or rights-of-way.
Screening measures shall be instituted in accordance with the standards
below, exclusive of access driveways and sidewalks:
i. Any screening measure shall be a minimum of thirty-six (36) inches
above the highest of the average final finish elevation of the adjacent
street, the parking lots, and the ground floors of all structures on the
site.
ii. Where earth berms are used, they shall conform to the following:
1. Berms shall be gently rolling in nature, undulate so as to
appear natural and not manmade, and have a maximum slope
ratio of 3:1 (horizontal run to vertical rise) and a recommended
slope of 4:1.
2. Where a berm does not reach the minimum required screening
height, additional screening measures shall be necessary.
iii. Where shrubs are used they shall be evergreen in nature, be at least
thirty (30) inches tall at the time of planting, and be spaced closely
enough together so as to create a seamless row of hedging.
iv. Where fences or walls are used they shall be no more than four (4)
feet in height and be constructed from a durable material (i.e. brick or
stone masonry, wood, iron, composite, etc.).
1. Any desired fence or wall shall avoid a stockade appearance.
2. Fences and walls should be designed with materials and
finishes that complement project architecture.
3. Fences and walls shall be aesthetically and functionally
enhanced through the incorporation of columns and piers, as
well as random variation in plane and direction of at least five
162
(5) feet for every fifty (50) feet of length. Generous vegetation
is encouraged to soften the appearance and to aid in the
prevention of graffiti.
v. Screening shall not be implemented in a manner which impairs the
sight lines of drivers entering, leaving or maneuvering through the
site.
NOTE: It is strongly encouraged that all screening measures incorporate a
combination of various techniques, including earthen berms, retaining walls,
semi-opaque walls and fences, and an assortment of plant materials in order to
enhance the screening function while offering this buffer area a natural,
aesthetically appealing appearance.
J. Lighting
Lighting and light under this section includes any temporary or permanent lighting
equipment that is installed, located or used in such a manner with the intention to cause
light rays to shine outdoors. This includes, but is not limited to, driveways, sidewalks and
walkways, parking lots, structures, signs, and all sports and recreational lighting. All
proposed exterior light sources including poles, standards, hangers, light fixtures,
reflectors, shields, and lamp (including and their wattage, color, height, and lumen
output) shall be submitted with the development plan for review and approval.
1. Reasonable amounts of lighting shall be allowed and provided, as appropriate, at
intersections, along walkways, at building entrances, between buildings, and in
parking areas.
2. The maximum height of any light source (bulb), regardless of the method for
mounting, shall not exceed twenty-five (25) feet. In large-scale developments, the
maximum height of any fixture shall be forty (40) feet.
a. Fixtures shall be appropriate in size and scale for the surrounding area.
b. Fixtures shall not exceed the height of adjacent structures.
3. Unshielded wall packs and floodlights are not permitted.
4. Commercial outdoor lighting shall be used for safe pedestrian passage and property
identification only during active business hours.
a. All non essential lighting shall be turned off within one-half (1/2) hour after the
close of business and/or when not in use.
b. Lights that are controlled by photocells and timers are highly encouraged.
5. No light shall be of such design, height, and/or intensity so as to produce glare or
direct illumination across the property line, nor shall any light be of the same so as to
create a nuisance or detract from the use and enjoyment of adjacent property. All
light shall be directed downward or inward toward the property by choosing
appropriate fixtures and properly aiming fixtures during installation.
a. All fixtures shall be Full Cut-Off and/or fully shielded in design so that no
light is visible above the lowest part of the fixture.
b. All fixtures shall be installed so that all light emitted, either directly from the
lamp or a diffusing element, or indirectly by reflection or refraction from any
part of the fixture, is projected below a horizontal plane which is parallel to the
ground surface.
c. No light source (bulb) should be directly visible from any point off of the
property or any roadway.
d. All signs lit by an external source where any lamp is rated higher than sixty
(60) watts incandescent, shall be lit by a top-mounted RLM type fixture.
163
e. Light levels at the property line shall not exceed 0.5 footcandles when
adjacent to other non-residential areas, and 0.1 footcandles when adjacent to
any residential area, as measured 5 feet above the ground.
6. Bulb Type
a. High-Pressure and Low-Pressure Sodium are highly recommended due to
their low energy consumption and long lamp life.
b. Metal Halide, due to their higher energy consumption, are generally
recommended only as commercial outdoor lighting where white light with
good color rendition is required or simply desired, such as car dealer display
lots, sports lighting, and service station canopies.
c. Mercury Vapor lamps, due to their higher operating costs, increased energy
demands, extremely poor color rendition, and greater contribution to light
pollution, are strongly discouraged.
d. Incandescent and/or florescent are most recommended for motion activated
fixture as well as low-intensity needs, such as entryways.
7. Fixtures should be architecturally compatible with, and designed to compliment, the
principle structure and surroundings.
8. All proposed fixtures shall be shown on the Landscape Plan.
K. Signs
All signage shall adhere to the guidelines and regulations detailed within Ordinance O-
96-60 and all amendments thereto (Article 1301, City of Conway Zoning Ordinance), all
overlay district regulations which may apply, and any and all other current laws
pertaining to signage. All sign concepts for new construction shall be considered during
the design of the site and structures, so that signs and graphics can be integrated into
the architecture of the project. Sign styles, size, height, scale, colors, location, and
material shall strongly relate to the design of the structures.
L. Exterior Seating and Eating and Drinking Establishments
1. Outdoor seating for eating and drinking not covered by permanent roof structure
2. shall be allowed for up to fifty percent (50%) of the establishments allowed indoor
seating.
3. The seating must be entirely on privately owned or leased property and outside the
public right-of-way. Any right-of-way encroachment must be approved by the
Conway City Council.
4. The seating shall not require or be dependant upon any new structures not otherwise
permitted by the City of Conway Zoning Ordinance.
5. All outdoor seating shall be arranged in such a way so as to be safe under all
conditions for pedestrian and vehicular traffic. It shall not inhibit the free circulation
on public sidewalks or safe egress from buildings.
6. The property owner shall be responsible for maintaining the outdoor seating area in a
clean, sanitary, and orderly manner.
7. Outdoor seating shall consist of only necessary items (i.e. tables, umbrellas, chairs,
patio heaters etc.).
8. Outdoor patio areas should be sheltered as much as possible from clamor of streets
and parking areas. Thoughtful locale, dense landscaping, and architectural screening
is strongly encouraged to aid in this provision.
M. Sidewalks
1. Sidewalks shall be constructed on as outlined by the Conway Subdivision Ordinance
O-00-03.
164
2. Sidewalks shall be constructed on all streets public and private, regardless of
classification, with the exception of alleys, for all projects requiring Development
Review.
N. Right-of-Way Dedication
If any streets abutting the project do not have the width of right-of-way required by the
Master Street Plan and Subdivision Ordinance for the classification of that street already
dedicated, the owner shall dedicate half the required additional right-of-way along each
street frontage prior to approval of the site plan.
O. I-3 Intensive Industrial District Standards
Due to the nature of industrial development, the City of Conway realizes that architecture,
landscaping densities, and overall site aesthetics are generally secondary to the utilitarian
considerations of building size and function; access, storage and circulation requirements;
and standard industrial district practices. However, the City does desire for industrial
development to appear as high of quality and be as visually appealing as is reasonable,
especially from the public realm. Therefore, the City will most closely review the Image
Zone of all proposed developments within the I-3 District. Developers should strive to place
considerable attention to this area.
All areas of an I-3 industrial projects Image Zone shall meet all standards required by this
Article for commercial, office, and multi-family development, especially with regards to
landscaping.
.
For all areas of an I-3 project, the following general standards shall be met:
1. Site Planning
Site layouts should be designed to provide aesthetically pleasing street scenes;
controlled accesses with maneuver area for emergency vehicles; convenient visitor
parking; well-screened outdoor storage, loading areas, equipment and service areas;
and an emphasis on the primary entrance or office portion of the building.
a. Expansive paved areas located between the street and the building should be
avoided in favor of multiple small lots separated by landscaping and
buildings. Visitor and handicap parking shall be located adjacent to the
primary building entrance while employee parking areas should be located at
the side or rear of the building.
b. Loading and storage areas shall be screened from view from the public realm
and/or when adjacent to non-industrial property. Wherever possible, various
screening methods should be incorporated into the site design to reduce the
visual impact of these facilities
i. orientation of the site;
ii. portions of the building;
iii. decorative screening walls or fencing;
iv. landscaping.
NOTE: Screening shall be designed as in integral part of the building design
and site layout.
c. All industrial developments should attempt to provide outdoor plazas or
enhanced site features at the building entries and/or in employee break
areas. It is encouraged that plazas and break areas include:
i. tables, benches, or seat walls;
ii. canopy trees, potted plants, trellises and other shade structures;
165
iii. trash receptacles;
iv. enhanced paving.
2. Landscaping should be used to screen unsightly areas from public view. It is
important to provide the majority of the landscaping where it provides the maximum
public benefit. Landscaping throughout the project should be considered essential,
and especially critical within the Image Zone, where it shall meet all other
landscaping provisions of this Article.
a. Barbed wire and razor wire visible from the public realm or non-industrial
property should never be used unless it is needed to solve a demonstrated
security problem.
b. All chain link fencing shall be painted or coated in a non-obtrusive color, such
as black or dark green, in order to diminish its visual impact.
3. Building Design
The guidelines for industrial development seek not to impose a particular
architectural theme or style but to promote quality development that will be an
asset to the City. Developers should strive to provide the most attention to
aesthetics within the Image Zone of the project.
a. Primary entryways to buildings in the I-3 Intensive Industrial District should
make every attempt to portray a quality office appearance through
architectural treatments.
b. Encouraged elements:
i. variation of building façade planes, direction, materials, and color;
ii. inclusion of architectural elements and details;
iii. building entry accentuation;
iv. pitched roofs where building size makes it feasible, and articulating
parapet caps where not;
v. screening of equipment and storage areas, to include those which are
rooftop-mounted; and
vi. landscaping along the base of structures to soften an otherwise bulky
appearance
c. Discouraged elements:
i. large, blank, flat surfaces;
ii. metal siding which dominates a façade;
iii. exposed, untreated concrete block walls (except split face);
iv. loading doors facing the street;
v. exposed mechanical equipment;
vi. highly reflective surfaces; and
vii. trash enclosure doors facing the street or visible from street;
d. Front elevations and primary entries should express a high window-to-wall
ratio. Window type, material, and proportion should complement the overall
façade.
e. Warmer earth tones are preferred to white or other colors which appear
obtrusive and reflect glare.
P. Special Standards
This Paragraph provides guidelines regarding the unique design characteristics of
specialized development types. It is imperative to note that this Paragraph is designed to
be used in conjunction with all other provisions of this Article. The Special Standards
guidelines are simply additions to the guidelines contained in the previous chapters.
When designing a project type detailed in this Paragraph, the reader should reference
the appropriate prior Paragraph(s) related to land use type, as well as the applicable
Special Standards section detailed below.
166
1. Mixed-Use Projects and Structures
These uses may be oriented vertically or horizontally on the site and may or may
not be in different structures. Mixed-use projects should be designed to provide a
harmonious environment for both commercial users and residents. Noise, traffic,
lighting, and other elements that may negatively affect the residential
environment should be located where the elements will have a minimum impact.
All mixed-use projects should also adhere to the multi-family and commercial
guidelines within this document.
a. With the exception of on-street parking, all parking areas should be provided
to the rear of structures or underground where feasible. This is especially
important on vertically oriented mixed-use projects.
b. Private, communal open space, accessible only by building residents, should
be provided.
c. Parking lot and security lighting for commercial uses should be appropriately
shielded so as not to spill into adjacent residential areas.
d. Loading areas and refuse storage facilities should be located as far as
possible from adjacent residential uses, both on- and off-site.
e. Commercial and residential parking areas should be clearly delineated
through dedicated signs, street markings, or other methods.
f. Provide clearly marked and separated driveways and parking areas for each
proposed use where possible.
g. Horizontal mixed-use developments should be designed using consistent
materials and architectural style. If the intent is to differentiate between uses,
some deviation is permissible.
h. When multiple uses are proposed in a single building, separate and
convenient entrances for each use should shall be provided. (O-16-136)
i. Any proposed building elevations that face public streets, whether such
elevations function as the front, side or rear of the building, should be
architecturally detailed to avoid the appearance of being the back of the
building. All buildings should function as positive additions to the
streetscape.
2. Large-Scale (Big Box) Retail Developments
Site planning for large-scale commercial facilities should strive to provide a
quality pedestrian environment in what is traditionally a facility designed for the
efficient movement of automobiles. If a truly effective and inviting atmosphere is
to be created, the needs of the pedestrian should be attended to in equal
proportion with those of vehicles. Provisions should be made for efficient
pedestrian circulation systems, way-finding means, safety lighting, and open
spaces that provide respite from expansive and crowded parking lots.
a. For all projects five (5) acres and larger, the incorporation of plazas,
courtyards, pedestrian malls, and other outdoor spaces for people to gather
shall be required.
i. A minimum of five percent (5%) of the total project shall be dedicated
as permanent common space and located in an area of the site which
makes them identifiable and easily accessible for public use. Any
landscaping within this common space shall be considered as part of
the twenty percent (20%) pervious surface requirement.
ii. All provided furniture, fixtures, water features, and other amenities
shall be considered integral components of development, maintain
architectural compatibility, and fully detailed on all landscape plans.
167
iii. These common areas should be sheltered as much as possible from
clamor of streets, parking, and other incompatible uses.
b. Buildings should be located as near to the street as possible in order to
further reduce the visual impact of expansive parking lots, promote
pedestrian activity, and help humanize what is generally an auto-oriented
environment. Address parking requirements while reducing the amount of
necessary landscaping by providing as much parking as possible along the
sides or rear of structures.
c. Clearly defined pedestrian circulation systems shall be provided throughout
the project site. Any crosswalks should be accentuated through the use of
textured and/or colored paving. All pedestrian systems shall consider ADA
path of travel and appropriate surface treatments.
d. The base of the building should be surrounded by a broad landscape buffer
so as to soften the buildings edge, allow opportunities for trees to be planted
(serving to reduce the imposing scale of the structure), and create a desirable
buffer between the building and any surrounding paved surfaces.
e. When crafting retail big-box facilities, every attempt should be made to
minimize imposing mass, encourage design that complements neighboring
buildings, and foster a human-scaled and pedestrian-friendly environment.
f. A variety of details and treatments should foster a lively and interesting
roofline, including, but not limited to, usage of cornice detailing to provide
unique caps atop building facades.
g. The design of any outdoor storage or gardening facilities should complement
the architecture of the primary building as well as the overall site design.
h. Any proposed building elevations that face public streets, whether such
elevations function as the front, side, or rear of the building, should shall be
architecturally detailed to avoid the appearance of being the back of the
building. Buildings should function as a positive addition to the streetscape.
i. The entryway to a big box store should serve as the visual focal-point for
the entire facility and should accordingly showcase an inviting human-scaled
entrance.
3. Vehicle Dealerships and Automotive Repair Shops
Vehicle dealerships and automotive repair shops are intensive and dynamic uses
characterized by constant, heavy automotive and pedestrian activity.
Accordingly, great care should be taken when siting such facilities within a
community so as to impose the minimum impact on surrounding uses.
a. Space for the unloading of cargo and vehicles from trucks shall be integrated
into the overall design of the site.
b. Associated uses or activities that create excessive amounts of noise (car
repair, exterior sound systems, cleaning, testing, etc.) should not be
immediately adjacent to residential areas.
c. Service areas associated with vehicle dealerships should be screened from
public view and abutting properties through the use of efficient and attractive
landscaping, fencing, and/or walls. Areas should be located at the back of the
project when feasible.
d. Any on-site service or repair facilities should:
i. provide vehicle access to individual bays which is internal to the site
(preferably the rear) and not directly off of street frontage;
ii. provide screening for such bays so as to not be visible from public
right-of-ways;
iii. provide a dedicated vehicle washing area; and
168
iv. not be visible or audible to passing pedestrians from the street or
adjacent residential areas.
e. Public and business-related parking areas should be clearly delineated
through dedicated signs, street markings, or other methods.
f. Specific site locations should be created for the storage of used oil and
lubricants pending recycling.
g. All compressors should be located in the interior of the site or within buildings
so as to minimize any audible impacts to adjacent properties.
h. Vehicle dealership landscaping
i. Trees shall be planted at the ratio of no less than one (1) canopy tree for
every sixty (60) feet of property line abutting any street. In the event
overhead obstructions exist which would prohibit the use of canopy trees,
understory trees shall be required.
ii. Trees shall be planted within parking lot landscape islands at a ratio of no
less than one (1) canopy tree per twenty-four (24) parking spaces.
iii. Any parking lot island required by Article 1101.7.I.6.c which does not
include a canopy tree shall be densely planted with evergreen shrubs at a
height of thirty (30) inches or greater. (O-13-109)
4. Fuel/Service Stations and Car Washes
Service stations and car washes are intensive uses characterized by large areas
of paving which permit vehicles to freely maneuver. As a result, these locations
have the potential to create significant adverse impacts for adjoining streets and
properties. Furthermore, while the basic architectural components of most
service stations (gas pumps/stalls, convenience stores, car washes, etc.) are
necessary, an opportunity exists for architectural forms that are unique, locally
sensitive, and ultimately attractive. Rather than simply adhering to a highly
standardized corporate model of design, service stations should draw from
surrounding structures and mimic established or historic themes.
a. Lush perimeter landscaping or other attractive and appropriate measures
should be provided to screen the paved areas.
b. Entry to and exits from car wash facilities should be oriented away from the
street and/or screened so as to diminish their visibility from the public right-ofway.
c. Each on-site gas pump should generally include stacking for a minimum of
two (2) vehicles (roughly forty (40) feet in length) so that driveways or the
street are not utilized by waiting customers.
d. Dense landscaping, berming, architectural treatments, or a combination these
elements should be used to maximize the screening of the site from public
view.
e. All structures on-site should be consistent with and complement the
architectural design of the primary building and overall project site.
i. Canopies should avoid appearing pre-engineered. Canopies should
appear relevant to the overall building design and that of the
surrounding area. The use of pitched roofs on canopies is strongly
encouraged.
ii. Canopy height should be held to the minimum necessary to achieve
daily operations. Open air pump stations are encouraged to
accommodate larger vehicles.
iii. Columns supporting the canopy should be of sufficient thickness to
portray a visual sense of strength, balance, and traditional masonry
169
proportions. The use of brick, stone, or other substantial building
materials are encouraged.
5. Regional Scale Developments
Projects of twenty-five (25) acres or more are deemed relevant on a scale
greater than standard projects, which typically aim to serve only the needs of the
population of Conway; these projects have a regional impact and, therefore, are
very often regional destinations. It is for this reason that a Regional Scale
Development (RSD) will be reviewed as unique environments with unique
dynamics. Although full compliance with the provisions contained within this
document is desired, there may be additional allowances for exceptions, to
include Article 1301 of the Conway Zoning Ordinance, based upon individual
merits and site characteristics. Each RSD will be reviewed, measured, and
approved independently of other RSDs which may have been developed prior.
All RSD development plans are required to gain Conway City Council approval
prior to any permit(s) being issued.
SECTION 1101.8  SPECIFIC SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS
Submissions which do not fulfill all requirements of this Section will not be accepted for review
or approval, unless otherwise expressly directed by the Planning Dept.
A. The following items are required for any Development Review:
1. A completed and signed Development Review Application

deny the initial license application. The decision whether to renew an employee license
shall be made within thirty (30) days of the completed application. The renewal of a
license shall be subject to the fee as set forth in Section 1201.6. The non-renewal of a

Chief, the Chief again must give notice in writing by certified mail, return receipt requested,
to the applicant of the reasons for the denial, and said denial is final and appealable.

those set forth in Section 1201.5 (I). During the pendency of any appeal, the parties shall
maintain the status quo unless in the interim, a court issues an injunction pursuant to

SECTION 1201.9  ASSESSMENT OF FINES
The Chief shall fine a business licensee and/or any person who is an operator, as the case may
be, in the amount of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) for each offense where he determines
by clear and convincing evidence that:
(1) A business licensee or an individual operator knew or should have known of the
possession, use or sale of controlled substances in the establishment;
(2) A business licensee or an individual operator knew or should have know of the sale, use
or consumption of alcoholic beverages in the establishment;
(3) A business licensee or an individual operator knew or should have known of nudity or
specified sexual activities occurring in the establishment; or
(4) A business licensee or an individual operator knew or should have known of a person
under eighteen (18) years of age entering the establishment.
It is not the intent of this Ordinance for the Chief to impose a fine upon a business licensee for
the occurrence of incidents outside the actual knowledge of the business licensee.
If the business licensee or the same individual operator of a sexually oriented business is fined
(and such fine(s) are upheld after judicial review pursuant to Section 1201.12) for the same
offense three times or more, and the dates of these offenses have occurred within a twelve (12)
month period, the business licensee or the individual operator, as the case may be, shall be
suspended in accordance with Section 1201.10. For purposes of Sections 1201.9, 1201.10 and
1201.11, multiple incidents of the same nature which would constitute a violation of any of the
provisions set forth in (1) through (4) above, shall be considered as only one (1) offense if they
occur within the same business day.
In the event that the Chief determines that one of the above described offenses has occurred
and determines that the assessment of a fine against the business licensee or an individual
operator is appropriate, the Chief must give notice in writing by certified mail, return receipt
requested, of each of the above reasons which support the assessment of a fine, including the
date or dates which each such incident occurred. Such notice shall be given within thirty (30)
days of the incident or incidences for which the business is being cited, or within thirty (30) days
of the conclusion of the Chiefs investigation, whichever is earlier.
A licensee may appeal the decision of the Chief regarding the assessment of a fine to the City
Council by filing a written notice of appeal with the City Clerk within fifteen (15) days after
service of notice upon the licensee of the Chiefs decision. The notice of appeal shall be
194
accompanied by a memorandum or other writing setting out fully the grounds for such appeal
and all arguments in support thereof. The Chief may, within fifteen (15) days of service upon
him of the licensees memorandum, submit a memorandum in response to the memorandum
filed by the licensee on appeal to the City Council. After reviewing such memoranda, as well as
the Chiefs written decision, if any, and exhibits submitted to the Chief, the City Council shall
vote either to uphold or overrule the Chiefs decision. Such a vote shall be taken within twentyone
(21) calendar days after the date on which the City Clerk receives the notice of appeal.
Judicial review of a fine by the Chief and City Council may be made pursuant to Section
1201.12 of this Ordinance.
Furthermore, judicial review of a suspension by the Chief and City Council may be made
pursuant to Section 1201.12 of this Ordinance. During the pendency of the appeal, the status
quo shall be maintained such that the licensee shall continue to be allowed to operate its
business pursuant to its license and pursuant to this Ordinance. This Section in no way is
intended to replace or substitute for other criminal penalties which may apply under local, state
or federal law for any of the activities enumerated above.
SECTION 1201.10  SUSPENSION
The Chief shall suspend the license of a business licensee and/or any person who is an
operator, as the case may be, for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days if he determines by
clear and convincing evidence that:
(1) a business licensee intentionally answered falsely a material question or request for
information during the application process;
(2) a business licensee or an individual operator is convicted of a specified criminal activity
on a charge that was pending prior to the issuance of the license;
(3) a business licensee or an individual operator has, with knowledge, permitted prostitution
on the premises;
(4) a business licensee or an individual operator has been fined for the same offense, of
those offenses listed in Section 1201.9, three times or more, and the dates of those
offenses occurred within a twelve (12) month period; or
(5) a business licensee or an individual operator is overdue in payment to the City of taxes,
fees, fines, or penalties assessed against or imposed upon him/her in relation to any
business. A licensee found in violation in this regard will have all rights and remedies
set forth in Section 1201.5 (H) to attempt to remedy any such deficiency before any
suspension of the license may occur.
If a business licensee is suspended by the Chief more than one time in a twelve (12) month
period, the license shall be revoked in accordance with Section 1201.11.
In the event that the Chief determines that one of the above described incidents has occurred,
and determines that suspension of the business license is appropriate, the Chief must give
notice in writing by certified mail, return receipt requested, of each of the above reasons which
support the suspension of the business license, including the date or dates when each such
195
incident occurred. Such notice shall be given within thirty (30) days of the incident or incidences
for which the business is being cited, or within thirty (30) days of the conclusion of the Chiefs
investigation, whichever is earlier.
A licensee may appeal the decision of the Chief regarding a suspension to the City Council by
filing a written notice of appeal with the City Clerk within fifteen (15) days after service of notice
upon the licensee of the Chiefs decision. The notice of appeal shall be accompanied by a
memorandum or other writing setting out fully the grounds for such appeal and all arguments in
support thereof. The Chief may, within fifteen (15) days of service upon him of the licensees
memorandum, submit a memorandum in response to the memorandum filed by the licensee on
appeal to the City Council. After review such memoranda, as well as the Chiefs written
decision, if any, and exhibits submitted to the Chief, the City Council shall vote either to uphold
or overrule the Chiefs decision. Such a vote shall be taken within twenty-one (21) calendar
days after the date on which the City Clerk receives the notice of appeal.
Judicial review of a suspension by the Chief and City Council may be made pursuant to Section
1201.12 of this Ordinance. During the pendency of the appeal, the status quo shall be
maintained such that the licensee shall continue to be allowed to operate its business pursuant
to its license and pursuant to this Ordinance.
SECTION 1201.11  REVOCATION
The Chief shall revoke a license for one (1) year from the date the revocation becomes effective
if he determines that any of the grounds for suspension set forth in Section 10 is proven by clear
and convincing evidence, and that the license has already been suspended within the preceding
twelve (12) months; or that the business operated while its license was suspended.
A licensee may appeal the decision of the Chief regarding a revocation to the City Council by
filing a written notice of appeal with the City Clerk within fifteen (15) days after service of notice
upon the licensee of the Chiefs decision. The notice of appeal shall be accompanied by a
memorandum or other writing setting out fully the grounds for such appeal and all arguments in
support thereof. The Chief may, within fifteen (15) days of service upon him of the licensees
memorandum, submit a memorandum in response to the memorandum filed by the licensee on
appeal to the City Council. After reviewing such memoranda, as well as the Chiefs written
decision, if any, and exhibits submitted to the Chief, the City Council shall vote either to uphold
or overrule the Chiefs decision. Such a vote shall be taken within twenty-one (21) calendar
days after the date on which the City Clerk receives the notice of appeal.
Judicial review of a revocation by the Chief and City Council may be made pursuant to Section
1201.12 of this Ordinance. During the pendency of the appeal, the status quo shall be
maintained such that the licensee shall continue to be allowed to operate its business pursuant
to its license and pursuant to this Ordinance.
196
SECTION 1201.12  JUDICIAL REVIEW
After denial of an initial or renewal application by the Chief and City Council, or upon a fine,
suspension or revocation by the Chief and City Council, the applicant or licensee may seek
judicial review in any court of competent jurisdiction. The rules and procedures for such appeal
are modeled on Rule 9 of the Arkansas Inferior Court Rules. Those Rules provide as follows:
(1) Time for taking appeal. All appeals from the City Council to a court of competent
jurisdiction must be filed in the office of the Clerk of the particular Court having
jurisdiction of the appeal within thirty (30) days from the date of the vote by the City
Council.
(2) How taken. An appeal from the City Council to a Court of competent jurisdiction shall
be taken by filing the record of the findings and proceedings of the Chief and the City
Council, to the extent such a record is available. It shall be the duty of the City Clerk to
prepare and certify such record when requested by the appellant, and upon payment
of any fees authorized by law therefore. The appellant shall have the responsibility of
filing such record in the office of the Clerk of the Court of competent jurisdiction.
(3) No record available. When the City Clerk neglects or refuses to prepare and certify a
record for filing in a Court of competent jurisdiction, the person desiring an appeal may
perfect the appeal on or before the 30th day from the date of the vote by the City
Council by filing an Affidavit in the office of the Clerk of the Court of competent
jurisdiction showing that he has requested the City Clerk to prepare and certify the
records for purposes of appeal, and that the City Clerk has neglected to prepare and
certify such records for purposes of appeal. A copy of such Affidavit shall be promptly
served upon the City Clerk and upon the adverse party.
SECTION 1201.13  NO TRANSFER OF LICENSE
A licensee shall not transfer his/her license to any person who has not obtained a license, nor
shall a business licensee operate a sexually oriented business under the authority of a sexually
oriented business license at any place other than the address designated in the application.
This section is not intended to prevent a business licensee from being allowed to sell, assign or
transfer ownership or control of his/her business to another person already possessing a valid
sexually oriented business license. It is intended only to prevent the sale, assignment, or
transfer of ownership or control of a license by the licensee, or of the business to a nonlicensee.

SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
CITY OF CONWAY, ARKANSAS
ARTICLE I
GENERAL PROVISIONS
SECTION 1. PURPOSE AND INTENT
These Regulations are formulated to promote safety, public health, and the general welfare of
the citizens of Conway and outlying environs. The purpose of these Regulations is to provide
for the harmonious development of Conway and the coordination of streets and other public
utility improvements within subdivisions with existing or planned improvements or other
features of the Comprehensive Plan. These Regulations and standards for the subdivision and
improvement of land for urban use are designed to make provision for adequate air, open
space, drainage, transportation, public utilities, and other needs, and to ensure the development
and maintenance of a healthy, attractive, and efficient community that provides for the
conservation and protection of its human and natural resources. These Regulations are
intended to set forth the procedures, requirements, and minimum standards governing the
subdivision of land within the territorial jurisdiction of the City of Conway and should be
administered in a manner:
(1) To assist the orderly, efficient, and coordinated land development within the territorial
jurisdiction of Conway in accord with its adopted Growth Plan.
(2) To promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the residents of the City.
(3) To ensure conformance of subdivision plans with public improvement plans for the City.
(4) To protect and conserve the value of buildings and improvements and to minimize adverse
impact on adjoining or nearby properties.
(5) To establish a beneficial relationship between the uses of land and buildings and the
municipal street system to require proper location and design of streets and building lines,
to minimize traffic congestion, to make adequate provision for pedestrian traffic
circulation.
2
(6) To establish reasonable standards of design and procedures for subdivision and
resubdivision ordered to further the orderly development and use of land and to ensure
proper legal descriptions and monumenting of subdivided lands.

SECTION 5. PROCEDURES
Any owner of land within the jurisdiction of the City of Conway seeking to subdivide property
shall not proceed with any construction work on the proposed subdivision, including grading,
before obtaining Preliminary Plat approval nor shall the owner attempt to record the plat of
the subdivision or any part thereof prior to obtaining Final Plat approval from the Planning
Commission.
Pre-Application Conference
When the owner of a tract of land proposes its subdivision, the subdivider is urged to discuss
informally the intent of his subdivision with the planning staff. No fees shall be collected for
Pre-Application Conference, its purpose being to acquaint the subdivider with plans and
policies in effect that may be significant to his proposed subdivision. The subdivider may
submit sketch plans and data showing existing conditions within the site and its vicinity and
the proposed layout and development of the proposed subdivision. At such meeting, the
general character of the development will be discussed and items including zoning, utility
service, street requirements, flooding and drainage, and other pertinent factors related to the
proposed development will be reviewed. The purpose and intent of the Pre-Application
Conference is to afford the subdivider an opportunity to obtain the advice of the planning staff
in order to avoid unnecessary costs and delays to the subdivider and to give informal guidance
to the development at a stage where potential points of conflict or differences can be readily
resolved.
Preliminary Plat
The first required step in the review process is the submission of an Application for
Preliminary Plat Approval.
A. Submission Requirements
The Application shall be submitted to the Planning Commission not fewer than seventeen
(17) days prior to the regular Planning Commission meeting at which it is to be considered
and shall consist of the following:
(1) A Letter of Intent.
(2) One (1) digital copy Five (5) copies of the plat plans and data as specified in Article
II, Section 3. (#O-18-111)
(3) A filing fee as specified in Article VI, Section 3.
9
B. Preliminary Approval
After the Planning Commission has reviewed the Preliminary Plat and taken into account
any staff recommendation, the Applicant shall be advised of any required changes and/or
additions. The Planning Commission shall approve, approve conditionally, or disapprove
the Preliminary Plat within eighty (80) days from the date of receipt thereof or the
Preliminary Plat shall be deemed approved unless the subdivider stipulates in writing to
the Planning Commission that additional time is allowed. If disapproved, the Preliminary
Plat shall be returned to the subdivider with a written statement as to the reasons for
disapproval.
The Planning Commission's approval of the Preliminary Plat shall be deemed as an
expression of approval of the layout submitted on the Preliminary Plat as a guide to the
installation of streets, water, drainage, sewer, and other required improvements and
utilities, the dedication and reservation of public lands, and to the preparation of the Final
Plat. Approval of a Preliminary Plat shall not constitute automatic approval of the Final
Plat.
When the Planning Commission finds the Preliminary Plat together with the Site
Improvements Plan meets all the requirements of this Regulation, it shall approve the Plat
by placing a Certificate of Preliminary Plat Approval upon the Preliminary Plat. This
stamp of Preliminary Plat Approval shall read:
"This Plat has been given Preliminary Plat Approval only and has not been
approved for recording as a public record. This Certificate shall expire on
______________ (date)."
(The certificate shall expire 12 months from date of approval unless extended by the
Planning Commission.) Such stamp approval shall bear the signature of the Chairman of
the Planning Commission and shall be dated. Six copies of the Preliminary Plat shall be
submitted. Five copies shall be distributed and/or retained by the Planning Commission
and one copy shall be returned to the subdivider upon approval.
C. Authorization to Proceed
Receipt of an approved or conditionally approved copy of the Preliminary Plat, together
with an approved copy of the Improvements Plan shall constitute authorization of the
Planning Commission for the subdivider to proceed with the preparation of the Final Plat,
the installation of improvements, and the staking out of lots and blocks. The subdivider,
after conditional approval of the Preliminary Plat, shall complete all improvements
required under this Regulation.
10
D. Expiration of Preliminary Plat Approval
If at the end of the twelve (12) month date of approval of the Preliminary Plat the
subdivider submits a written request for extension of the preliminary approval, the
Planning Commission may grant an extension of up to twelve (12) additional months
providing, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, sufficient work has been
completed with respect to the required improvements on the property.
Without the request for extension, the preliminary plat approval shall automatically
expire 12 months from the original date of approval and further development work will
require approval of another Preliminary Plat. Further, no more than one extension will
be granted. An approved preliminary plat conditioned upon the developer completing
a "punch list" shall also be considered to be null and void should the "punch list" in its
entirety not be completed within the designated twelve (12) month period from the
date of preliminary plat approval.
Final Plat
When the requirements of this Regulation have been satisfied and while the Preliminary
Plat Approval is in effect, the subdivider may submit to the Planning Commission an
Application for Review and Approval of the Final Plat. When the requirements of this
Regulation have been satisfied and while the Preliminary Plat Approval is in effect, the
subdivider may submit to the Planning Commission an Application for Review and
Approval of the Final Plat. If the submitted final plat conforms to an approved preliminary
plat and all the requirements for final plat approval in ARTICLE II PLAT
REQUIREMENTS, the plat may be reviewed, approved and signed by the Chair of the
Planning Commission after review and approval by staff and without further review by
the Planning Commission. Otherwise, the plat must be reviewed by the Planning
Commission for final plat approval

11
B. Approval by Planning Commission
The Final Plat of the proposed subdivision shall be submitted to the Planning Commission
for final approval prior to expiration of the Preliminary Plat. If not submitted for final
approval within such time, the preliminary plat shall be considered as having been
abandoned.
If the subdivider requests permission to develop only a portion of the property for which
the Preliminary Plat was approved, the Planning Commission may grant approval of a
Final Plat for said portion alone.
The Planning Commission shall approve or disapprove the Final Plat within eighty (80)
days of receipt thereof; otherwise said Final Plat shall be deemed to have been approved.
Disapproval of the plat shall be transmitted to the subdivider with the reasons therefor
within a reasonable time (not to exceed two weeks) after the meeting at which the plat was
disapproved.

field techniques and procedures shall be compatible with the equipment utilized
to insure that a true urban type A accuracy level is achieved.
C. Position and reference information shall be provided on a standard data control
form for a minimum of two (2) CAGIS monuments, which shall be intervisible
with each other and submitted with the final plat. Forms may be obtained from
the City of Conway Planning Department. These monuments will be included in
the CAGIS geodetic control network if, after their review by the City, they are
determined to be suitable for inclusion into the network.
D. All interior corners of the subdivision (lot corners, street center line control
points, etc.) shall be established and monumented to meet the minimum
accuracy standards established by the Arkansas Minimum Standards for Property
Boundary Surveys and Plats.
24
SECTION 3. VERTICAL CONTROL STANDARDS
A. The vertical datum for all survey work performed shall be the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum 1988 Adjustment (NGVD88). All vertical control work shall
commence and end at CAGIS geodetic control monument or CAGIS first
generation monument.
B. Elevations for all concrete monuments shall be determined to an accuracy
standard equal to third order classification as defined by the federal geodetic
control committee. All field techniques and procedures shall be compatible with

25
ARTICLE IV
GENERAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES
SECTION 1. CONFORMANCE TO GROWTH PLAN
The purpose of this portion of the Regulation is to specify the basic and minimum
requirements for lots, blocks, streets, and other physical elements in new subdivisions. It also
provides a guide for the staff, the Planning Commission and the applicant in the review and
preparation of subdivision plats. To ensure the various purposes of the Subdivision
Regulations are adhered to, all subdivisions hereinafter established shall conform with the
various elements of the Growth Plan (Resolution Number R-96-9) adopted June 11, 1996 by
the City of Conway and any subsequent amendments or modifications adopted by the City.
The various elements of the Growth Plan, including the location of major thoroughfares and
streets, location of parks, playgrounds, schools, and other public sites, and appropriate land
uses, shall be designed to conform with minimum zoning and building regulations for the area
in which the proposed subdivision is located.
SECTION 2. SUITABILITY OF LAND
Land subject to flooding or topographically unsuitable for residential occupancy and which
the Planning Commission considers unsuitable for subdividing shall not be platted for any use
that may increase the danger to health, life, and property or aggravate erosion or flood hazard.
When such land is in the proposed plat, this land shall be set aside for such land uses as will
not be affected by periodic flooding or unsuitable topographic conditions unless adequate
corrective measures are formulated by the developer and approved by the Planning
Commission.
SECTION 3. PROVISION OF LAND FOR PUBLIC PURPOSES
Where proposed community or public facilities of the municipal plan are located in whole or
in part in a proposed subdivision, the Planning Commission, City Council, or public board
shall require that land for those public facilities be reserved as a condition of preliminary plat
approval.
Such reservations shall be referred to the appropriate public board, commission, or body
having jurisdiction or financial responsibility to permit the opportunity to acquire said sites
either through purchase, taking an option, or the filing of condemnation proceedings under the
power of eminent domain. The contract to acquire the subject public site must be closed
within 12 months following the date of approval of the preliminary plat by the Planning
Commission or the subdivision process shall continue without regard for the proposed
community or public facilities.
26
SECTION 4. ACCESS
Every subdivision shall be served by a publicly dedicated street and every lot or parcel within
a subdivision shall have direct access to a publicly dedicated street, or in the case of a PUD,
access to a public street by means of a private street, or in the case of lots in C-1, C-3 and O-
1 zoning districts, access to a public street by means of a dedicated access easement. (#O-00-
154) In no case shall a lot be permitted where the lot is fronted by a stub-out or street
termination. In such cases, dead-end fire apparatus turnarounds shall be provided. (#O-05-
75) All lots shall front on public streets except for PUDs where private streets may prevail
subject to Planning Commission approval and except for lots in C-1, C-3 and O-1 zoning
districts, where access to a public street may be established through a dedicated access
easement. (#O-00-154)
SECTION 5. SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS
The quality of design of the urban area is dependent upon the quality of individual
subdivisions. Good community design requires coordination of the efforts of each subdivider
and developer in the community. The design of each subdivision shall be prepared in accord
with the principles established by the Growth Plan for land use, traffic, circulation, community
facilities and public utility services, and in accord with the following general design standards:
A. Streets
The location and width of all streets, thoroughfares, and roads throughout the Conway
urban area shall conform to the growth plan. The arrangement, character, extent, width,
grade and location of all streets shall be designed in accord with the following provisions:
(1) Streets shall be related appropriately to the existing topography so as to produce
usable lots and streets of reasonable gradient. Street grades and alignment shall
conform reasonably to the original topography and in steep areas, through streets
should generally follow contour lines rather than cross them. Combinations of steep
grades and curves shall be avoided. Sudden and frequent changes in grade along
arterials shall be avoided. Sharp horizontal curvatures should be avoided if possible
at or near the high point of a crest, vertical curve, or near the low point of a
pronounced sag or vertical curve.
(2) The proposed street layout should be appropriate for the type and development
proposed and integrated with the street system in the adjoining subdivisions. The
layout shall also conform to existing and proposed land uses for the area.
27
(3) The designers of residential streets are encouraged to lay them out to slow the use
by through traffic, to permit efficient drainage and utility systems, and to require the
minimum length of pavement necessary to provide convenient and safe access to
property. Methods to slow traffic may include offset street centerlines, curvature of
streets, narrowing of streets for limited distances, development of gateway entrances,
changes in elevation of streets and/or a combination of methods. All methods must
meet all relevant city regulations and must be approved by the City Engineer and the
Planning Director. Multiple uses in an area are encouraged. If the Planning
Commission determines that a residential street is being designed in such a way as
to encourage high-speed and/or cut through traffic, it may require changes in the
design and/or platting of that street or the use of traffic calming techniques so as to
slow traffic and discourage cut-through traffic. At the initiation of the applicant, any
such required change may be appealed to the City Council. (#O-00-17)
(4) Proposed through streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the tract to be
subdivided unless the Planning Commission has determined that such extension is
not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision with
existing and adjoining parcels.
(5) New boundary streets (those bordering the perimeter of the property) shall be
avoided except where the requirement of the Master Street Plan provides a defined
alignment. In that event, the developer of the proposed plat proposed shall provide
payment to the City in lieu of construction for one-half of the street construction cost
and shall dedicate no less than one-half of the specified right-of-way as noted on the
Master Street Plan. (#O-01-08 removed the section in italics, #O-01-85 reinstated it and #O-03-
110 once again removed it.)
(6) The City in turn shall build the boundary street within five years from the date of
plat acceptance or shall return the full amount of escrowed money plus interest to
the developer. (Ordinance No. O-01-08 removed the section in italics and
Ordinance No. O-01-85 reinstated it.) Exemption: If the City Council, by majority
vote, establishes that the new boundary street will not be built with city funds over
the next five years, no payment for future improvements of the street shall be
required. (#O-02-65 created this paragraph and #O-03-110 removed it.)
28
(7) The Planning Commission may authorize a new boundary street when the subdivider
proposes to dedicate the entire right-of-way and construct all the required
improvements. In no case shall a subdivider retain a parcel of land lying between a
newly created boundary street and a former property line, the purpose of which
would be to deny access by abutting owners. Where the plat to be submitted includes
only a part of the tract owned or intended to be subdivided by the subdivider, a
tentative plan of proposed future street system for the unsubdivided portion of
property shall be prepared and submitted to the Planning Commission. Furthermore,
proper access in the form of stub streets or temporary dead-end streets shall be
provided to adjacent unplatted property unless, in the judgment of the Planning
Commission, topographic conditions or physical constraints preclude reasonable
provision of such access or alternate routes are or will be available in the future.
(7A)Existing streets which do not meet city standards for width and construction and
which abut any property submitted for subdivision or replatting which results in a
greater number of lots than the number existing, shall be improved to city standards.
For existing boundary streets which do not meet these city width and construction
standards, the requirements in (5) above apply. (Ordinance O-01-85) As an option
to meeting the requirements in (5) above, the developer may submit a performance
bond or an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of one-half the street construction
cost and that bond or letter of credit must meet the requirements of ARTICLE VI,
SECTION 5 of this ordinance, except the performance bond or irrevocable letter of
credit must run for five years and the City of Conway may have access to the money
at any time during that five years in order to complete the street improvements. If the
City does not initiate construction of the improvements during that five years, the
performance bond or letter of credit shall be allowed to lapse. (Ordinance No. O-03-
32) Exemption: If the City Council, by majority vote, establishes that the boundary
street will not be improved with city funds over the next five years, no payment for
future improvements of the street shall be required. (#O-01-101 created this paragraph and
#O-03-110 removed it.)
(8) Cul-de-sac Streets
a. Cul-de-sacs tend to reduce the number of connections and choices available for
people traveling by automobile and increase congestion on other streets. Where
cul-de-sacs are utilized, pedestrian and bicycle pathways to allow linkages with
like abutting properties and the street system may be provided. Construction
standards for the pedestrian and bicycle pathways shall be the same as for
sidewalks. For instance, pathways could be provided linking the backs of lots
fronting on the termination of cul-de-sacs and providing access to sidewalks
along through streets.
29
b. Cul-de-sac streets or courts designed to have one end permanently closed or
streets or street loops with a single access shall have a distance no greater than
six hundred and fifty (650) feet from the point of access to the nearest point of
the furthest lot with the distance measured along the shortest route within the
street right-of-way.
Exceptions:
1. A cul-de-sac street may be up to one thousand one hundred and twenty (1120) feet
in length if it has a right-of-way of not less than sixty (60) feet in width, a paved
width from back of curb to back of curb of not less than forty (40) feet and it meets
all other requirements for a cul-de-sac.
2. A residential cul-de sac street may be up to one thousand one hundred and twenty
(1120) feet in length if it has a right-of-way of not less than fifty feet in width, a
paved width from back of curb to back of curb of not less than twenty-seven (27)
feet, all lots provide no less than ninety (90) feet of width at the building line per
dwelling unit and it meets all other requirements for a cul-de-sac.
3. Any cul-de-sac over 750 feet must have fire department approval. (#O-05-75)
c. Where a street does not extend to the boundary of a subdivision and its
continuation is not necessary for access to adjoining property, its terminus shall
be no closer than 50 feet to such boundary.
30
d. An acceptable turnaround shall be provided at the end of all permanent dead-end streets
exceeding 150 feet in length. Turnarounds for residential and commercial streets shall
conform to dimensions and requirements shown in Figure A, Table 1, and Table 2. A 96
foot diameter cul-de-sac requires a 120-foot right-of-way. Measurements assume back
of curb to back of curb for a roll curb. (#O-05-75)
e. In the case of temporary dead-end streets, less than 150 feet in length, which are stub
streets designed to provide future connections with unsubdivided adjacent areas, the
Planning Commission may require a temporary easement for a turnaround of the type
discussed above. No building permit may be issued for lots with sole frontage on a stub
out or at the end of a stub out without an approved turnaround. (#O-05-75)
(9) The Planning Commission shall have the authority to determine the street names and
to require changes in any proposed names.
31
(10) Intersections and Alignment
a. Street intersections shall be laid out as nearly at right angles as possible. The centerline
of no more than two streets shall intersect at any one point. No intersection shall be at
an angle of less than seventy-five (75) degrees and where collector and arterial streets
intersect other collector or arterial streets, the curb radii at the intersection shall not be
less than thirty-one and one-half (31 1/2) feet. Where residential streets intersect with
other residential, collector or arterial streets, the curb radii at the intersection shall not
be less than twenty-five (25) twenty-eight (28) feet. (#O-05-75)
b. Local street centerline offsets of less than 125 feet shall be avoided. Proposed new
intersections along one side of an existing street shall, wherever practical, coincide with
any existing intersection on the opposite side of the street. In proximity to intersections
of collector streets and above in the Functional Classification System, centerline offsets
of less than 250 feet shall be avoided.
c. Additional street paving and right-of-way in the form of turning lanes shall may, upon
consultation with the City Engineer and/or the Planning Staff, be required along arterial
streets at intersections with other arterial or collector streets. (#O-03-36)
d. Property line corners at street intersections shall be rounded with a radius of at least
twenty-five (25) twenty-eight (28) feet. (#O-05-75). Property line corners at 4-way
intersections of two collector or arterial streets meeting at ninety (90) degrees shall be rounded
with a radius of at least one hundred (100) feet to provide adequate right-of-way. Property line
corners at all other ninety (90) degree intersections shall be rounded with a radius of at least
twenty-eight (28) feet. For intersections meeting at angles other than ninety (90) degrees, the
design radii must be approved by the City Engineer. (#O-18-56)
e. Street intersections shall be located to avoid creating hazardous driving conditions.
f. Roundabouts of appropriate size are recommended at all proposed four-way
intersections, which may require larger curb radii. All intersection designs must be
approved by the City Engineer. (#O-18-56)
(11) Street grades and minimum design standards shall be provided as noted on Table 2
below. Roadway design standards shall conform to the City of Conway Standard
Details for Roadway & Drainage Construction. (#O-18-111)

SUPER ARTERIAL
The specific design standards for this classification are to be determined on a road-by-road basis, dependent upon
the specific needs of the road. It is anticipated that the design standards will be of a higher standard than a major
arterial, but of a lower standard than for an interstate or expressway.
SPECIFIC STREET DESIGN STANDARDS
1. Commercial, Office, and Industrial Streets - Streets within commercial, office, and industrial zones must meet
requirements for collectors and above.
2. Central Business District Rights of Way - For existing streets in the C-1 Central Business District, no additional right
of way dedication that would encompass any existing buildings is required during the replat or subdivision process.
3. Residential Open Ditch Standard - For residential subdivisions and replats where each lot is one hundred fifty (150) or
more feet in width at the building line, and where each lot accommodates no more than one dwelling unit, the
minimum street width is reduced four (4) feet, a three (3) foot compacted gravel shoulder is required on each side, no
curbs or gutters are required and open ditches are allowed. An additional five (5) feet of drainage easement is required
on each side of the street right-of-way to accommodate open ditches. No further subdivision creating lots less than 150
feet in width and no density greater than one dwelling unit per lot shall occur without improving the entire length of
the street to residential street standards. Streets within commercial and office zones shall not utilize this open ditch
street standard. Sidewalks are required.
4. Major and Minor Arterial Paving Width - Developers are responsible for the cost of the first 36 feet of paving width of
major and minor arterial streets. The City of Conway will be responsible for the cost of any additional width of streets
should the City choose to have a wider street built. The City may choose to build or have built a lesser width than that
shown in the Street Classification and Design Standards Table for major and minor arterial streets, but no less than
thirty six (36) feet, except when the first phase of a four lane or greater roadway is being built.
5. Curb Cut/Traffic Conflicts - For subdivisions and replats that abut collectors, minor arterials, and major arterials, the
lots shall be configured to allow curb cuts on those streets only as a final option for providing access.
6. Minimum Lot Width on Collector and Above - In order to reduce potential traffic conflict points caused by lots with
less than 100 feet of street frontage with access to collectors, minor arterials, and major arterials, the Planning
Commission and/or the Director of Planning may require the grouping or sharing of driveways. Driveway access
easements will be shown on the plat/replat. (#O-11-98)
33
7. Residential Street Grade Maximums - With approval of the Fire Chief and Planning Commission, streets classified as
residential may have grades up to a maximum of twelve percent (12%) and minor residential streets a maximum of
fifteen percent (15%).
8. Fire Hydrant Clearance - A minimum clearance of twenty-six (26) feet must be provided around a fire hydrant. See
Figure B.
9. Curb Island Clearances - A minimum clearance of twenty (20) feet must be provided on each side of an island within
the street right of way. Street right of way must extend ten (10) feet beyond outside curbs where islands are used.
10. Industrial Open Ditch Standard - For subdivisions in I-3 zoning areas with lots having a minimum of two hundred
(200) feet of street frontage, an industrial open ditch street standard may be adopted. This industrial open ditch
standard consists of a thirty (30) foot wide asphalt surface with three (3) foot gravel shoulders and open ditches. Ten
(10) feet of drainage easement is required on each side of the street right-of-way to accommodate open ditches.
(#O-08-94)
a. Central Business District Rights of Way - For existing streets in the C-1 Central Business District, no additional right
of way dedication that would encompass any existing buildings is required during the replat or subdivision process.
Urban Core Area - For existing streets in the Urban Core Area, no additional right of way dedication that would
encompass any existing buildings is required during the replat or subdivision process. No additional right of way
dedication or reduced rights of way may also be applicable if warranted by the pattern of urban development.
b. Major and Minor Arterial Paving Width - Developers are responsible for the cost of the first 36 feet of paving width of
major and minor arterial streets. The City of Conway will be responsible for the cost of any additional width of streets
should the City choose to have a wider street built. The City may choose to build or have built a lesser width than that
shown in the Street Classification and Design Standards Table for major and minor arterial streets, but no less than
thirty six (36) feet, except when the first phase of a four lane or greater roadway is being built.
c. Curb Cut/Traffic Conflicts - For subdivisions and replats that abut collectors, minor arterials, and major arterials, the
lots shall be configured to allow curb cuts on those streets only as a final option for providing access.
d. Minimum Lot Width on Collector and Above - In order to reduce potential traffic conflict points caused by lots with
less than 100 feet of street frontage with access to collectors, minor arterials, and major arterials, the Planning
Commission and/or the Director of Planning may require the grouping or sharing of driveways. Driveway access
easements will be shown on the plat/replat.
e. Fire Hydrant Clearance - A minimum clearance of twenty-six (26) feet must be provided around a fire hydrant. See
Figure B.
f. Curb Island Clearances - A minimum clearance of twenty (20) feet must be provided on each side of an island within
the street right of way. Street right of way must extend ten feet beyond outside curbs where islands are used.
(#O-18-56)
34
B. Alleys
(1) Alleys may be required at the rear of all lots used for nonresidential purposes where
access for service, emergency vehicles, etc. is not otherwise adequately provided.
Alleys shall be permitted in residential areas.
(2) All alleys must be paved with concrete, which meets the minimum street requirements
with the center depressed to carry water. Curbs and gutters are not required. The
paved width of an alley shall not be less than sixteen (16) feet with a minimum rightof-
way of not less than twenty feet.
(3) Where alleys are provided, intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be
avoided and dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible.
(4) No parking shall be allowed in alleys.
C. Easements
(1) Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall be provided for utilities
and shall be at least ten feet in width. Easements shall be provided where a subdivision
is traversed by a water course, drainage way, channel or stream, or there shall be

effect.
(6) Corner lots shall be at least seventy-five (75) feet in width at the building line to allow
for side building lines. Corner lots should be roughly 20% larger than interior lots.
(7) Double frontage lots other than corner lots fronting on two streets shall not be platted
except under extreme circumstances, as may be approved by the Planning
Commission, in which case building lines shall be established for both front and rear
lot lines. Double frontage and reverse frontage lots should be avoided except where
they are needed to provide for the separation of residential developments and traffic
arteries or to overcome specific topographic or site constraints. Where double frontage
exists, a planting screen easement of at least ten feet shall be provided along a portion
of the lot abutting the traffic artery or other use where screening is required. In this
circumstance there shall be no right of access across the planting screen easement. At
the discretion of the Planning Commission, the developer may substitute for an
easement and a planting screen, a permanent ornamental fence, or wall of the height
and architectural character, which will be appropriate and appropriately screened.
Should the ornamental wall or fence be used, there shall still be a restriction upon right
of access and such restriction shall clearly be so designated on the plat and within the
accompanying Bill of Assurance.
(8) Every lot must slope to a street or to a drainage easement.

gutter prior to set up of the crushed stone course.
SECTION 3. ALLEYS
Alleys shall be concrete or asphalt paved and conforms to street standards. The paving shall
be formed in such a manner as to carry water longitudinally to the street and/or storm drainage
system.
SECTION 4. STORM DRAINAGE
(1) Every subdivision shall be served by a storm drainage system including drains, sewers,
catch basins, culverts, and other appropriate storm drainage facilities. All subdivisions
shall be provided with a storm drainage system that is designed and constructed to handle
rainfall runoff that originates or traverses the subject subdivision. Storm drainage
41
capacity upstream and downstream of the property must be addressed in the project
planning. Storm drainage for residential areas and for shopping centers, industrial areas,
and highway commercial areas shall be designed for a 10-year rainfall frequency. The
quantity of runoff shall be calculated using acceptable engineering methods of
computation. Such computations shall be checked and approved by the City Engineer.
All drainage facilities shall be so designed to serve the entire drainage area and all
surface drainage shall be transported to existing storm sewers or to drainage facilities as
approved by the City Engineer. The City Engineer and the Planning Commission shall
approve all drainage features. No open drainage channels shall be constructed within
the area dedicated as public streets and alleys with the exception of streets constructed
under the provisions of footnote (3) in Table 1.
(2) The developer/subdivider shall pay for all costs incurred within the internal drainage
system including the cost of facilities to handle water coming into the subdivision from
lands owned by parties other than the developer. The City may, at its discretion,
participate in the cost of oversize storm sewer lines.
(3) The size and capacity of storm drainage systems receiving the storm water discharge
downstream of the subdivision shall be shown on the street plans and evaluated to
determine if the downstream systems are adequate. Off site drainage, improvements
may be required by the city engineer if significant adverse impact is anticipated.
(4) Provision shall be made to intercept and divert surface or concentrated storm water flows
within or along the boundary into storm drainage systems. Generally, drainage areas
greater than one acre flowing onto or away from individual lots shall be intercepted in
drainage ways located in drainage easements and routed into the subdivision storm
drainage system.
(5) All open ditches within the subdivision must be improved to provide a condition equal
to concrete bottom and concrete sidewalls.
(6) Storm drainage pipes, ditches, and drainage structures must be free of sediments, trash,
and debris and ponding water prior to final approval of the streets.
(7) The development plans shall include and identify a prepared and dedicated flowage path
or floodway that will accommodate a one hundred (100) year frequency storm event
across and through the development. The quantity of water that the floodway area must
accommodate shall be based on a one hundred (100) year rainfall event less that
accommodated by the underground storm drainage system. The floodway or flowage
area shall generally follow the natural low place or valley through the development. It
is anticipated that the street system or open ditches will be utilized where practical to
accommodate the floodway. Where the floodway area leaves the street right-of-way, the
area shall be shaped and graded to form a surface channel of adequate capacity to
accommodate the flow with a positive downstream gradient along its entire length. The
floodway shall be uniformly graded along the length of the floodway such that water will
not pond or accumulate on the surface due to humps or depressions along the route.
The floodway shall be designed to receive one hundred (100) year runoff from the
upstream adjacent property and properly discharge the runoff at the downstream limits
42
of the floodway. The estimated elevation of the one hundred (100) year flood shall be
computed along the floodway. Computations for the quantity of storm water runoff,
sizing of the floodway and elevation of the one hundred (100) year flood shall be
prepared by a registered professional engineer and submitted to the City Engineer for
review and approval. The computations shall be made using usual and accepted
methods and procedures as approved by the City Engineer. A floodway will not be
required where less than five (5) acres of adjacent lands drains onto the developed
property and the total drainage area is less than five (5) acres.
43
(8) An easement of adequate width to accommodate the required floodway shall be provided
on the plat. The easement shall clearly identify the easement as a 100-year Floodway.
The plat shall have a note that reads as follows: No structures, fill or obstructions
shall be placed in the 100 year Floodway easement. No reshaping of the surface within
the 100-year Floodway easement shall be made without the approval of the City
Engineer. No fences shall be in the floodway easement.
(9) Minimum floor elevations shall be placed on the plat for all lots less than three (3) feet
above the computed one hundred (100) year flood elevation. The minimum finished
flood elevation shall be established at one (1) foot above the computed one hundred
(100) year flood elevation.
(10) Storm water detention or other storm water flow reduction measures shall be provided
where existing downstream subdivisions or developments have storm drainage systems
with a capacity of less than a ten (10) year frequency storm. The requirement does not
apply to the inadequate natural streams or creeks flowing through undeveloped areas.
The storm water detention facilities shall be designed to provide a holding area such
that storm water runoff can be accumulated and released through at an outlet structure.
The required storage volume and outlet structure shall be sized to release the storm
water at a rate that does not exceed the capacity of the downstream storm drainage
system or a computed runoff rate equal to that of the pre-development conditions of the
proposed development, whichever is the greater. The detention facilities shall be based
on a twenty-five (25) year frequency storm event. Computations for the sizing of the
detention facilities and outlet structure shall be prepared by a registered professional
engineer and submitted to the City Engineer for review and approval. The computations
shall be made using usual and accepted methods and procedures as approved by the
City Engineer.
(11) Detention basins may be either wet basins having a permanent pool of water for
aesthetic purposes or a dry basin that retains no water other than that required during
the storm event. A dry basin shall be graded and shaped to provide for the positive
drainage of surface water from all portions of the basin. A concrete paved channel may
be required from the inlet pipe to the outlet pipe to provide a maintainable bottom area.
(12) An easement shall be placed around the high water limits of the detention area.
(# O-03-156)
44
SECTION 5. WATER SUPPLY
(1) All subdivisions containing more than 4 lots within the corporate limits shall be provided
with a water supply and a distribution system approved by the Conway Corporation and
meeting the requirements of the State Health Department. The water supply and
distribution system shall be designed to provide the anticipated water consumption
within the subdivision including fire protection. Recognized engineering design criteria
shall be used to design the system. Fire hydrants shall be installed by the subdivider and
shall be located so as to adequately protect each lot within the subdivision. Fire hydrant
location shall be approved by the Conway Corporation and shall be placed so that the
furthest point of a lot in a residential subdivision is no more than 900 600 feet from the
nearest hydrant on the same street. Fire Hydrants shall be placed so that the furthest
point of a lot in a commercial subdivision is no more than 400 feet from the nearest
hydrant located on the same street. The Planning Commission may require other
appropriate spacing in commercial and/or industrial subdivisions. (#O-05-75)
(2) Where lot splits or minor subdivisions are proposed outside the corporate limits and
subject to State Health Department approval, well water may be acceptable by the
Planning Commission as a water supply source.
SECTION 6. SANITARY SEWAGE DISPOSAL
(1) All subdivisions shall be provided with an improved sewage collection and treatment
system. Connection with the City's sanitary sewer system shall be required except where
the Planning Commission determines that such connections will require unreasonable
expenditure when compared with other methods of appropriate sewage disposal. Where
a public sanitary sewer is within 300 feet of any point of a subdivision, the subdivider
shall install a system of sewer lines and provide connection to each lot. Such sanitary
sewage system shall be installed prior to the installation of the street pavement.
(2) Where a public sanitary sewer is not readily accessible, an alternative method of sewage
disposal for each lot or a community sewage disposal system may be used when in
compliance with the standards of the Health Department and these Regulations.
(3) If a sanitary sewage treatment system or septic tank system is to be installed, plans for
such system shall be approved by the State Department of Health and the Conway
Corporation prior to approval of the Final Plat by the Planning Commission.
(4) The sewage collection system shall be designed to handle the anticipated flow of sewage
from within the subdivision including development of future sections of the same
subdivision and adjacent areas within the same drainage basin or pump station service
area. Recognized engineering design criteria in accord with the requirements of the State
Department of Health shall be utilized to design the system.
45
(5) Any surface discharge of wastewater shall be in accordance with requirements of the
Arkansas Department of Pollution Control and Ecology. The downstream drainage
route for any surface discharge shall be shown on the plat to the point of connection to
a year round flowing stream.
SECTION 7. OTHER UTILITIES
Other utilities installed within a subdivision shall be located within the dedicated public rightsof-
way or appropriately dedicated easements. If stubs to the property lines are not installed,
connections between the lots and the utility lines shall be made without breaking into the street
surface where possible. It is the intent of the City Council in adopting the provisions of these
Regulations related to public utilities that the existing subdivision regulations, codes and
ordinances specifically pertaining to public utilities, whether in effect or hereinafter enacted,
shall be and remain in effect and shall not be repealed by the enactment of this subdivision
ordinance.
SECTION 8. STREET NAME MARKERS
Street name signs shall be placed on diagonally opposite corners of each street intersection in
conformance with the specifications adopted by the City. Street name markers shall be
installed by the City at the developer's expense. Design of the markers and signs shall conform

SECTION 9. SIDEWALKS
Sidewalks shall be constructed within any subdivision in accordance with these regulations.
The minimum construction requirements for sidewalks are as follows:
1. Sidewalks shall be constructed on both sides of all streets within all zoning districts
within Conway city limits and within the Conway Territorial Jurisdiction.
Exceptions:
A. A minor replat not creating any new lots shall not require the construction of
sidewalks or payment of sidewalk in-lieu fees.
B. Subdivisions in the I-3 zoning district are not required to construct sidewalks or
pay sidewalk in-lieu fees.
C. Large lot subdivisions outside the city limits and within Conways Territorial
Jurisdiction are not required to construct sidewalks. A large lot subdivision is
defined as a subdivision having lots with greater than 150 feet of street frontage.
2. All sidewalks shall be handicapped accessible to public streets at street corners and at
designated mid-block public service drives/alleyways. Sidewalks shall meet American
Disability Act standards.
3. Sidewalks As Part of Commercial, Multi-Family, and Mixed Use Developments:
Sidewalks along streets in commercial, multi-family, and mixed use subdivisions shall
be constructed concurrently with building construction as part of site development
review. Sidewalks shall be the responsibility of the builder/owner, not the subdivider.
The sidewalk shall be installed prior to the final inspection and issuance of a certificate
46
of occupancy. However, the subdivider/developer of commercial subdivisions/replats
with pre-existing development shall be required to meet the sidewalk provisions of
Article 1101 Development Review of the Conway Zoning Ordinance.
4. Sidewalks Along Residential Streets: Sidewalks along streets with residential lots shall
be constructed by the homeowner/builder. The sidewalk shall be installed prior to the
final inspection and issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Subdivisions which
received preliminary plat approval prior to October 31, 2005 shall be exempt from the
requirement to construct sidewalks on residential streets, however, these subdivisions
with residential exemptions shall include sidewalks along both sides of streets
classified as collector or above.
5. Sidewalks along streets on unbuildable, green space, and other permanently vacant lots
will be the responsibility of the subdivider/developer.
6. When a subdivider/developer creates double frontage lots with one side along a street
classified as a collector or above, the subdivider/developer shall construct sidewalks
along the collector or greater street frontage.
7. When a subdivider/developer creates a residential boundary street, the subdivider
developer shall construct sidewalks along previously developed lots.
8. Any subdivider/developer required sidewalk shall be constructed concurrently with
other subdivision infrastructure. Such construction shall be completed or assurance for
construction shall be required along with other infrastructure improvements prior to
filing of the final plat.
9. All sidewalk construction, locations, and responsibility for construction shall be clearly
identified on the final plat. Detailed sidewalk construction drawings coordinating
sidewalks with other street/lot/easement infrastructure shall be shown on or included
with the final plat.
10. The subdivider/developer may request a waiver from the sidewalk construction
requirements. Such waivers shall only be approved for unusual circumstances. The
following factors shall be considered in order to determine whether or not to grant a
waiver request by the subdivider/developer:
A. ARDOT determination that a sidewalk is not allowed within state right-of-way.
B. Pedestrian traffic generators such as parks and schools in the area.
C. The existence of a sidewalk network in the immediate area.
D. The density of current and/or future development in the area.
E. The amount of pedestrian traffic likely to be generated by the proposed
development.
F. Whether the terrain is such that a sidewalk is physically practical and feasible, and
the extent to which drainage ditches, trees, ground cover, and natural areas would
be adversely impacted by the construction of the sidewalk.
47
G. The design of the subdivision such that utilities, the location of structures, rights
of way, easements, etc., create conditions making sidewalks impractical.
The Director of Planning and Development shall have the authority to grant such
waivers, or may defer requests to the Planning Commission. Action by the Director of
Planning and Development may be appealed to the Planning Commission.
If a waiver is granted, the subdivider/developer shall contribute funds in lieu of
sidewalk construction equal to the four-year rolling average of the WEIGHTED
AVERAGE amounts listed for CONCRETE WALKS in the four most recent
editions of the Arkansas Department of Transportation Weighted Average Unit
Prices. This in-lieu fee shall be subject to a maximum fee equivalent to one hundred
fifty (150) feet of street frontage per lot for lots intended for single-family or twofamily
dwelling uses. There shall no maximum fee for lots containing or intended for
other uses.
The funds shall be deposited into a general sidewalk fund to be used solely for the
addition of new sidewalks and maintenance of the existing sidewalk network. The
dispersal of funds from this sidewalk fund shall be at the direction of the Conway City
Council.
The Planning Commission may also grant a waiver to construct an internal pedestrian
trail system in lieu of the required sidewalks. The pedestrian trail right of way shall be
clearly noted on the final plat. Specifications for the right of way width, trail pavement,
and other specifications shall be determined by the City Engineer and Director of
Planning and Development. (# O-19-50)
11. Aside from the required sidewalks along collectors and arterials, an internalized
pedestrian circulation system in the form of pathways, either along streets or not, may
be constructed within subdivisions upon the request of the applicant and the approval
of the Planning Commission. The system may be allowed to deviate from the
construction requirements set out otherwise in this section, as long as the minimum
dimensional requirements are met.
(#O-08-94)
(12) Sidewalks are to be constructed as required within the Conway city limits and within the

(G) Sidewalk elevation. The sidewalk elevation shall be two (2) percent above the top of
the curb, sloping two percent towards the curb (one-fourth inch in each foot). This
elevation shall be continuous through the driveway approach.
(H) Driveway approach. The area remaining between the sidewalk and the flow-line of
the gutter, called the approach to the driveway, shall slope up to the elevation of the
sidewalk.
(I) Joint material. Wood shall not be acceptable in sidewalks for expansion joints. The
joint material shall be the same as approved for AHTD sidewalk construction
(AASHTO M 213).

joints, or saw-cut joints, shall be placed in sidewalk at regular intervals not greater
than 5 feet apart.
(K) Edges. All sidewalks shall have one-half (½) inch rolled edges.
(L) Removal/replacement. Removal and replacement of broken sidewalks require
vertical saw-cuts on both ends of the sidewalk being replaced.
Design Variance. A variance from these design standards may be granted for topographical
difficulties, tree preservation, aesthetics, etc. The Planning Commission must approve these
variances. Field variances, for location only, may be granted upon agreement of the City
Engineer and Planning Director, if special situations justify such variances. Special
conditions may be required in order to grant the variances.
(# O-05-122 for all of SECTION 9)
SECTION 10. STREET LIGHTING
Street lighting shall be required within all subdivisions within the corporate limits in accord
with the standards and spacing prescribed by the Conway Corporation.
SECTION 11. SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS
(1) The Commission, upon the request of the subdivider, may waive the requirements of
specifications and design. Whenever the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size
and shape or is surrounded by such development for unusual conditions that the strict
49
application of the requirements contained herein would result in a substantial hardship
or inequity, such modification may be granted upon written request of the subdivider or
his agent stating the reason or reasons for each modification. The approval of such
modifications shall each require two-thirds vote of the full membership of the
Commission.
(2) The Commission, upon request of the subdivider, may permit special exceptions to be
made to the improvements required by the rules and regulations when, in the opinion of
the Commission, such exceptions are in keeping with the intent of these rules and
regulations and when exceptions will provide for a development which will be in
conformance with existing platting of the general neighborhood of the proposed
subdivision. The subdivider may be required to furnish special information in order to
aid the Commission in its determinations. This approval shall also require two-thirds
vote of the full membership of the Commission.
(3) Personal hardship and financial considerations are not deemed overriding factors for the
granting of a variance, exception or waiver.
(4) Conditions may be required in order to grant any variance, exception or waiver.

ARTICLE VI
ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
SECTION 1. ADMINISTRATION
(1) These rules and regulations shall be administered by the Planning Department staff. The
Commission may, from time to time, recommend instructions and operating procedures
to be followed in the administration of these Regulations to the end that the public may
be better informed and that approval of plats be expedited.
(2) In addition to the requirements established herein, all subdivision plats shall comply with
all other applicable rules, regulations and laws including but not limited to the Growth
Plan, the Conway Zoning Ordinance, building and housing codes, and any other
regulations adopted by the City Council and any regulations or special requirements of
the State Health Department, State Highway & Transportation Department, or other
appropriate State agencies.
SECTION 2. ENFORCEMENT
It shall be the duty of the Building Inspector, City Engineer and the Planning Department to
enforce these Regulations and to bring to the attention of the Mayor and the City Attorney any
violation or lack of compliance herewith. In order to carry out the purposes of the Regulations
and to assure the orderly development of land after the effective date of these Regulations, the
following shall apply:
(1) The Building Inspector shall not issue building permits for any structure on any lot in a
subdivision for which the plat has not been approved and recorded in the manner
prescribed herein, unless configuration of a parcel of property has been established by
deed prior to July 1, 1986 on a date no less than ten (10) years prior to the date of
issuance of the building permit and the parcel meets all criteria for a lot in that zoning
district, or for which the configuration was established outside the planning jurisdiction.
A permit may also be issued if the applicant makes a reasonable effort to subdivide or
replat the property and, for reasons beyond their control, they are unable to do so and
if, after examination of relevant deeds to assure that the creation of this parcel did not
result in the creation of any substandard parcels that would not have been approved in
a subdivision or replat as lots in the zoning district in which they are located, the
Planning Commission votes to allow the issuance of the permit with at least seven of the
ten members voting in favor of such issuance. (#O-02-81)
(2) No electricity will be turned on until street and drainage are accepted by the City
Engineer or until a cash bond, performance bond or letter of credit in compliance with
the above sections has been tendered and accepted by the City as an alternative.
(3) No plat of any tract of land within the planning area jurisdiction shall be accepted by the
Circuit Clerk/Recorder for filing of record unless the plat has been approved by the
Planning Commission.
(4) No conveyance by metes and bounds of tracts or lots coming under the definition of
subdivision of land without compliance with the applicable provisions of this code or
51
amendments thereto shall be permitted. No dedication of streets shall by itself be
accepted by the City unless the usage of the adjoining affected land is shown. If the
purpose of the opening of the street is to make the affected land available for sale as a
redevelopment or subdivision, the street may not be accepted until accompanied by the
required plat.
(5) No public utility whether publicly or privately owned shall provide, extend or authorize
the extension of service to any lot, building, structure, or location within the area under
the jurisdiction of the City of Conway unless:
a. A lot, building or structure was established before the adoption of this Subdivision
Regulation; or
b. A plat of the location has been approved by the Planning Commission and filed
and recorded in the office of the Circuit Clerk/Recorder.
(6) Notwithstanding the above provisions, nothing herein shall prevent a citizen of Conway,
other than a subdivider in violation of this ordinance, from obtaining a building permit,
final inspection, utility service or any other administrative service or remedy, upon the
following conditions:
a. Where the lot for which the administrative permit or service sought lies within a
subdivision which fails to conform with the requirements of this ordinance and
such nonconformity was known to the Planning Commission Staff and no action
to enforce the requirements of this ordinance was initiated by requesting an
injunction in a court of competent jurisdiction within six (6) months of acquiring
knowledge of the alleged violations or nonconformity; or,
b. Where the lot for which the administrative permit or services sought lies within a
subdivision which was located in the territorial jurisdiction, but outside the city
limits at the time of filing and which was filed with the Planning Department and
reviewed by the Planning Commission, yet did not receive final plat approval
within one (1) year after review by the Planning Commission and where all such
actions and one (1) year waiting period after review took place prior to January 27,
1998.
(7) The issuance of any building permit does not constitute acceptance of or intent by the
city to accept any streets providing access to the lot on which the permit is issued.
51
SECTION 3. FEES
For each preliminary plat submitted at the time of filing, the subdivider shall pay to the
Designated Agent the following filing fee:
Residential:
$200 + Engineering Fee =< 10 lots
$400 + Engineering Fee =< 25 lots
$800 + Engineering Fee => 26 lots
Nonresidential and Mixed Use:

For each Final Plat submitted, the fee shall be as follows:
Residential:
$200 =< 10 lots
$400 =< 25 lots
$800 => 26 lots
Nonresidential and Mixed Use:
$800
Any subsequent variances, waivers, extensions, etc. after preliminary or final plat approval
that require the plat to be placed on the Planning Commission agenda shall pay a fee of one
hundred dollars ($100). (#O-07-121)
All recording fees shall be paid by the subdivider.
SECTION 4. PENALTY
Any person, firm or corporation that violates any provision of these Regulations or
amendments thereto shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction shall be fined not less
than $50.00 nor more than $100.00 for each offense and each day that any violation of these
rules and regulations are in effect shall constitute a separate offense and be subject to
additional fines of between $50.00 and $100.00 per day. Appropriate actions and proceedings
may be taken by law or in equity to prevent any violation of these Regulations, to prevent
unlawful construction, to recover damages, to restrain, correct, or abate a violation, to prevent
illegal occupancy of a building, structure, or premise, and these remedies shall be in addition
to the penalties described above.
SECTION 5. ASSURANCES FOR COMPLETION/INSTALLATION
Upon final approval of construction plans for required improvements; the subdivider shall
enter into an agreement with the City to install or ensure the completion of improvements as
outlined below. The City will accept the subdivision and issue the Certificate of Final Plat
Approval subject to the assurances of installation of improvements. One of the following
52
methods shall be used by the subdivider to guarantee that improvements required by these
Regulations can or will be installed in accord with approved plans and specifications.
A. Certificate of Completion of Improvements
The subdivider may submit for approval to the City Engineer a statement certifying that
all improvements and installations to the subdivision required for its approval under the
terms of these rules and regulations have been made, added, or installed in accordance
with these specifications.
54
Performance Bond
If the subdivider cannot certify that all improvements and installations in the subdivision
have been completed, a performance bond may be posted to the City of Conway for
completion of said improvements. Such performance bond shall specify the time for
completion of these improvements and installations and shall be in an amount
determined by the City Engineer and/or the Conway Corporation and agreed to be of
sufficient amount to complete the improvements and installations for the subdivider in
compliance with these rules and regulations. Such performance bond shall be issued by
a surety company authorized to do business in the State of Arkansas and shall remain in
force for a period of one year. The performance bond shall not be renewed without
approval of the Planning Commission.
C. Cash Deposit
The subdivider may provide a cashier's check in the full amount as specified by the City's
Engineer as sufficient to complete the improvements and installations required to
comply with these rules and regulations. The check shall be cashed one year from date
of approval on the final plat unless improvements are completed.
D. Irrevocable Letter of Credit
The subdivider may provide an irrevocable letter of credit to the City of Conway
pursuant to the following conditions.
(1) The letter of credit will be for an amount equal to the total estimated cost for
improvements as determined by the City Engineer and may be reduced
proportionately to the percent of work completed.
(2) The letter of credit will be irrevocable and will list the City of Conway as the
beneficiary.
(3) The letter of credit will be in a form approved by the City Attorney.
(4) The City shall be entitled to payment upon making demand for payment under the
terms of the credit in the event the subdivider is in default. Further, the City shall be
entitled to use all of the money secured by the letter of credit to assure the cost of
completion of the work in the subdivision.
(5) The subdivider will not be entitled to any excess monies until the work in the
subdivision has been completed.
(6) The terms of the letter of credit shall be limited to a time specified not to exceed one
(1) year unless extension is granted by the Planning Commission.
55
(7) The letter of credit extension shall provide all costs incurred by the project and
related inflation costs.
When the Planning Department has received notification that one of the four heretofore
described mechanisms assuring completion of the improvements have been executed, the
Planning Commission may certify final plat approval. After and only after final plat approval,
the plat then may be recorded by the Planning Department.
SECTION 6. ASSURANCE OF ONE YEARS MAINTENANCE
It is required that no less than one years maintenance by the developer be assured prior to the
filing of the plat. In order to achieve this aim, one of the following methods, dependent upon
the method utilized for assurance of performance, must be followed:
A. Certificate of Completion of Improvements
If a certificate of completion of improvements is submitted prior to filing of the plat, a
maintenance bond or letter of credit must also be submitted to the City prior to the
filing of the plat. The maintenance bond or letter of credit must meet the following
conditions:
1. It must be in an amount equal to ten dollars ($10) per lineal foot of pavement or
per lineal foot of drainage where no pavement parallels the drainage as well as the
amount needed to provide the required as-built drawings.
2. It must be irrevocable and shall list the City of Conway as the beneficiary.
3. It must be in a form approved by the City Attorney.
4. It must run for no less than one year.
5. At the end of that year, if the improvements have not been adequately maintained,
as determined by the City Engineer, the City shall be entitled to payment upon
making demand for payment under the terms of the maintenance bond or letter of
credit. Further, the City shall be entitled to use all of the money secured by the
maintenance bond or letter of credit to assure the proper maintenance of the
improvement.
6. The subdivider shall not be entitled to any excess monies until the maintenance of
the improvements in the subdivision has been completed.
B. Performance Bond
If a performance bond is posted to assure completion of the improvements, that
performance bond must also include provisions that automatically convert it to a
maintenance bond upon completion of the improvements or on the date the
performance bond lapses, whichever comes first. Such maintenance bond shall meet
all the conditions in A. Certificate of Completion of Improvements listed in Section 6
above.
56
C. Cash Deposit
If a cashiers check is provided to assure completion of the improvements, that
cashiers check shall be cashed upon completion of the improvements or one year from
submittal, whichever comes first. Upon completion of the improvements, a sum in the
amount of ten dollars ($10) per lineal foot of pavement, or per lineal foot of drainage
where no pavement parallels the drainage as well as the amount needed to provide the
required as-built drawings, shall be held by the City of Conway for a period of one
year to assure proper maintenance. Any amount above this sum shall be returned to
the provider of the cashiers check. At the end of this year, this sum shall be used to
perform any needed maintenance. Any amount not needed for proper maintenance, as
determined by the City Engineer, will be returned to the provider of the cashiers
check.
D. Irrevocable Letter of Credit
If an irrevocable performance letter of credit is posted to assure completion of the
improvements, that letter of credit must also include provisions that automatically
convert it to an irrevocable maintenance letter of credit upon completion of the
improvements or on the date the performance letter of credit lapses, whichever comes
first. Such maintenance letter of credit shall meet all the conditions in A. Certificate
of Completion of Improvements listed in Section 6 above. 
SECTION 7. INSPECTIONS
All projects shall be constructed according to the approved plans and specifications of the City
Engineer and the Conway Corporation. The City Engineer shall be given twenty-four (24)
hours notice prior to placement of storm drainage pipe, sub grade preparation, curb and gutter
construction, crushed stone base course placement or street pavement. No work shall proceed
until approval has been given by the City Engineer. Inspections shall be made in accordance
with other applicable ordinances. The City Engineer or his designated agent shall then inspect
those facilities, improvements and installations for conformance with plans and specifications.
If such inspection reveals that there are any defects or deficiencies in such improvements as
installed or that improvements differ from the final engineering plans and specifications
accepted by the City and/or the Conway Corporation, the appropriate City agency shall notify
the subdivider and his engineer in writing of such defects, deficiencies, and deviations. The
subdivider shall, at his expense, correct such defects or deviations prior to expiration of any
bonds or letters of credit. When such deficiencies have been corrected, the subdivider shall
notify the City Engineer in writing that improvements are again ready and a final inspection
shall be conducted. When the improvements required by these rules and regulations have
been completed and installed, the responsible agent of the developer shall submit a letter to
the City certifying improvements and installations have been made in accord with the
approved construction plans, specifications, drawings, and standards established by the City
and that such improvements are functioning properly.
57
SECTION 8. ACCEPTANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS
(1) All public dedications of streets within the corporate limits shall be accepted by the City
following execution of satisfactory guarantees for completion of improvements as
prescribed herein. This acceptance shall be accomplished after final plat approval and
after submission by the developer of the required maintenance bond.
(2) The Final Plat can be recorded only after the plat has received a Certificate of Final
Approval from the City. Submittal for recording purposes to the County Recorder shall
be the planning staff's responsibility. Final Plat shall be duly recorded within two years
of Final Plat approval or the plat shall be declared null and void. No building permits
may be issued until proof of the recording of the approved Final Plat has been presented
to the appropriate City department.
SECTION 9. VARIANCES
(1) When, by the strict interpretation of these Regulations, a subdivider incurs undue
restrictions on the physical property to be subdivided, a variance for such requirements
may be granted by the Planning Commission. Under no circumstance should a variance
be granted because of a personal hardship or for personal or emotional reasons.
Variances shall not be granted based strictly on financial hardship. A variance is
determined by the strict interpretation and enforcement of the rules and regulations upon
a given piece of property to be subdivided.
(2) No variance shall be granted except upon written petition by the subdivider when the
preliminary plat is filed. Under exceptional circumstances the Planning Commission
may grant variances at the time of final plat approval. The petition shall state fully the
grounds for the variance and all the facts upon which the petition is made. In granting
the variance the Commission shall prescribe any conditions that it deems necessary to
or desirable in the public interest. In considering the petition for a variance, the
Commission shall take into account the nature of the proposed use of land involved,
existing uses of land in the area, proximity to public utilities, the number of persons who
will reside or work in the proposed subdivision, and the probable effect of such variance
upon traffic conditions and upon the public health, safety and general welfare in the
vicinity. No variance shall be granted unless the Commission finds all four of the
following:
a. That there are special circumstances or conditions affecting the land involved such
that the strict application of the provision of this code would deprive the applicant
of the reasonable use of this land.
b. That the variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial
property right of the applicant.
c. That the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public health, safety
and welfare or injurious to other property in the area.
d. That the granting of the variance will not have the effect of preventing the orderly
subdivision of other land in the area in accord with the provision of this code.
58
(3) The findings of the Commission together with the specific facts upon which findings are
based shall be incorporated into the official minutes of the Commission meetings at
which such variance is granted. Variances may be granted only when in harmony with
the general purpose and intent of this code.
SECTION 10. VACATION OF PLATS
(1) Any plat or any part of a plat may be vacated by the owner of the premises at any time
before the sale of any lot therein by written instrument to which a copy of such plat shall
be attached declaring the same to be vacated. Vacation of a plat shall be subject to the
approval of the City Council if the plat is located within the corporate limits and subject
to the Quorum Court if located outside the corporate limits, but within the planning
jurisdiction of the Conway Planning Commission.
(2) Such an instrument shall be approved by the Planning Commission with the same plat
submission requirements, review processes and fees as are required for plats of
subdivisions. Between the preliminary plat and the final plat, the City Council will be
afforded the opportunity for review and may reject any such plat that destroys public
rights in any of its public uses, improvements, streets or alleys.
(3) Such an instrument shall be executed, acknowledged or approved and recorded or filed
in like manner as plats of subdivisions. Being duly recorded or filed shall operate to
destroy the force and effect of the recording of the plat so vacated and to divest all public
rights in the streets, alleys, and public grounds and all dedications laid out or described
in such plat.
(4) When lots have been sold, the plat may be vacated in a manner herein provided by all
the owners of lots in such plat joining in the execution of such writings.
SECTION 11. AMENDMENTS
On any proposed amendments to these Regulations, the Planning Commission shall hold a
public hearing for which fifteen (15) days advance notice in a local newspaper of general
circulation has been published. Following such hearing the City Council may adopt the
amendment or amendments as recommended by the Planning Commission or as determined
by the majority vote of the City Council. Provided, the City Council may waive the
requirement for notice and public hearing contained herein upon a unanimous vote of the
council. (#O-01-84)
59
SECTION 12. IMPACT FEES
Impact fees to pay for city infrastructure needs created by development are required to be
paid specific to uses anticipated for the property and the procedures established by the City
Council. These impact fees and the manner in which they are collected and utilized may be
established by the City Council and such fees may be adjusted by the City Council at intervals,
as changing circumstances warrant.
A. Short Title and Applicability
(1) This section may be known and cited as Conway's "Impact Fee Ordinance," and is
referred to herein as "this section."
(2) The provisions of this section shall apply to all of the territory within the corporate
limits of the City of Conway.
B. Intent
(1) The intent of this section is to ensure that impact-generating development bears a
proportionate share of the cost of improvements to the City's major roadway and
park systems; to ensure that the proportionate share does not exceed the cost of
providing major roadways and parks; and to ensure that funds collected from
impact-generating development are actually used to construct major roadway or
park system improvements that serve new development. It is further the intent of this
section to use road and park impact fees to implement the Citys Growth Plan and
Master Street Plan.
(2) It is not the intent of this section to collect any money from any impact-generating
development in excess of the actual amount necessary to offset demands generated
by that development for major roadway or park system improvements for which the
fee was paid.
C. Findings
The City Council of Conway, Arkansas, finds that:
(1) The protection of the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City
requires that the roads and parks of the City be expanded and improved to meet the
demands of new development.
(2) The creation of an equitable impact fee system would enable the City to impose a
more proportionate share of the costs of required improvements to the major
roadway and park systems on those developments that create the need.
60
(3) The impact fee study sets forth reasonable methodologies and analyses for
determining the impacts of various types of development on the City's major roadway
and park systems.
(4) The road and park impact fees described in this section are based on the impact fee
study, and do not exceed the capital costs required to serve the development that will
pay the fees.
(5) The types of improvements to the major roadway and park systems considered in the
impact fee study will benefit all impact-generating development, and it is therefore
appropriate to treat the City as a single service area for purposes of calculating,
collecting, and spending the impact fees for each type of facility.
(6) There is both a rational nexus and a rough proportionality between the development
impacts created by each type of new development covered by this section and the
road and park impact fees that such development will be required to pay.
(7) This section creates a system by which impact fees paid by impact-generating
development will be used to expand the major roadway and park systems, so that the
development that pays each fee will receive a corresponding benefit within a
reasonable period of time after the fee is paid.
(8) The impact fees are calculated in the impact fee study based on the existing level of
service for road and park facilities. For roads, the level of service is defined as the
system-wide ratio of capacity to demand in the major road system, and the fees are
based on a one-to-one ratio, even though the existing system provides significantly
more capacity than existing demand. For parks, the level of service is based on the
ratio of the replacement value of existing parkland and improvements to the existing
number of equivalent dwelling units.

(2) If the type of impact-generating development for which a building permit is
requested is not specified on the above schedule, the impact fee administrator
shall determine the fee on the basis of the fee applicable to the most nearly
comparable type of land use on the fee schedule. In the case of road impact
fees, the impact fee administrator shall be guided in the selection of a
comparable type of land use by trip generation rates contained in the most
current edition of the report titled Trip Generation, prepared by the Institute
of Transportation Engineers (ITE), or articles or reports appearing in the ITE
Journal.
(3) In many instances, a particular structure may include auxiliary uses associated
with the primary land use. For example, in addition to the actual production
of goods, manufacturing facilities usually also have office, warehouse,
research, and other associated functions. The impact fees generally are
assessed based on the primary land use. If the applicant can document that a
secondary land use accounts for over 25% of the gross floor area of the
structure, and that the secondary use is not assumed in the trip generation or
other impact data for the primary use, then the impact fees may be assessed
based on the disaggregated square footage of the primary and secondary land
use. Even when located within shopping centers, fast-food restaurants and
service stations (convenience stores with gasoline sales) shall be considered
primary uses.
(4) If the type of impact-generating development for which a building permit is
requested is for a change of land use type or for the expansion, redevelopment,
or modification of an existing development, the fee shall be based on the net
increase in the fee for the new land use type as compared to the previous land
use type.
(5) In the event that the proposed change of land use type, redevelopment, or
modification results in a net decrease in the fee for the new use or development
as compared to the previous use or development, there shall be no refund of
impact fees previously paid.
H. Independent Fee Calculation
(1) The impact fee may be computed by the use of an independent fee calculation
study at the election of the applicant, or upon the request of the impact fee
administrator, for any proposed land development activity interpreted as not
one of those types listed on the fee schedule or as one that is not comparable
to any land use on the fee schedule, and for any proposed land development
activity for which the impact fee administrator concludes the nature, timing or
location of the proposed development makes it likely to generate impacts
costing substantially more to mitigate than the amount of the fee that would be
generated by the use of the fee schedule.
(2) The preparation of the independent fee calculation study shall be the sole
responsibility and cost of the party electing to utilize the study.
68
(3) Any person who requests to perform an independent fee calculation study shall
pay an application fee for administrative costs associated with the review and
decision on such study.
(4) The independent fee calculation study shall be based on the same formulas,
level of service standards and unit costs for facilities used in the impact fee
study, and shall document the methodologies and assumptions used.
(5) The road impact fees shall be calculated according to the following formula.
FEE = PROJECT VMT x NET COST/VMT
Where:
PROJECT VMT = TRIPS x % NEW x LENGTH ÷ 2
TRIPS = Daily trip ends generated by the development during the work week
% NEW = Percent of trips that are primary, as opposed to passby or diverted-link trips
LENGTH = Average length of a trip on major road system
÷ 2 = Avoids double-counting trips for origin and destination
NET COST/VMT = COST/VMT - CREDIT/VMT
COST/VMT = COST/VMC x VMC/VMT
COST/VMC = Average cost to create a new VMC based on historical or planned projects
VMC/VMT = The system-wide ratio of capacity to demand in the major roadway system
CREDIT/VMT = Credit per VMT, based on revenues to be generated by new development
69
(6) The park impact fees shall be calculated according to the following formula.
FEE = PROJECT EDUs x NET COST/EDU
Where:
PROJECT EDUs = UNITS X EDUs/UNIT
UNITS = Number of dwelling units of a given housing type
EDUs/UNIT = Number of EDUs represented by one dwelling unit of a given housing type
NET COST/EDU = COST/EDU - CREDIT/EDU
COST/EDU = Ratio of total replacement cost of existing park land and improvements to
existing EDUs
CREDIT/EDU = Credit per EDU, based on revenues to be generated by new development
(7) An independent fee calculation study submitted for the purpose of calculating
a road impact fee may be based on data, information or assumptions from
independent sources, provided that:
a. The independent source is an accepted standard source of
transportation engineering or planning data; or
b. The independent source is a local study on trip characteristics carried
out by a qualified transportation planner or engineer pursuant to an
accepted methodology of transportation planning or engineering.
I. Use of Fees
(1) An impact fee fund that is distinct from the general fund of the City is hereby
created, and the impact fees received will be deposited in the following
interest-bearing accounts of the impact fee fund:
a. Road Impact Fee Account; and
b. Park Impact Fee Account.
(2) The road impact fee account shall contain only those road impact fees collected
pursuant to this section plus any interest which may accrue from time to time
on such amounts.
70
(3) The park impact fee account shall contain only those park impact fees collected
pursuant to this section plus any interest which may accrue from time to time
on such amounts.
(4) Monies in each impact fee account shall be considered to be spent in the order
collected, on a first-in/first-out basis.
(5) The monies in each impact fee account shall be used only for the following:
a. To acquire or construct system improvements of the type reflected in
the title of the account;
b. To pay debt service on any portion of any current or future general
obligation bond or revenue bond issued after the effective date of this
section and used to finance major roadway or park system
improvements of the type reflected in the title of the account;
c. As described in subsection J, Refunds;
d. As described in subsection K, Credits; or
e. As described in subsection L(4) relating to the costs of administering
this section.
(6) The monies in each impact fee account shall not be used for the following:
a. Rehabilitation, reconstruction, replacement or maintenance of existing
facilities except to the extent that the projects increase the capacity to
serve new development;
b. Ongoing operational costs; or
c. Debt service for any past general obligation bond or revenue bond
issued prior to the effective date of this section, or any portion of any
current or future bond issued after the effective date of this section and
not used to finance major roadway or park system improvements of the
type reflected in the title of the account.
71
J. Refunds
(1) Any monies in the impact fee fund that have not been spent within seven (7)
years after the date on which such fee was paid shall be returned to the current
owners with earned interest since the date of payment.
a. Notice of the right to a refund, including the amount of the refund and
the procedure for applying for and receiving the refund, shall be sent
or served in writing to the present owners of the property within thirty
(30) days of the date the refund becomes due. The sending by regular
mail of the notices to all present owners of record shall be sufficient to
satisfy the requirement of notice.
b. The refund shall be made on a pro rata basis, and shall be paid in full
within ninety (90) days of the date certain upon which the refund
becomes due.
(2) If an applicant has paid an impact fee required by this section and the building
permit later expires without the possibility of further extension, and the
development activity for which the impact fee was imposed did not occur and
no impact has resulted, then the applicant who paid such fee shall be entitled
to a refund of the fee paid, without interest. In order to be eligible to receive
such refund, the applicant who paid such fee shall be required to submit an
application for such refund within thirty (30) days after the expiration of the
permit or extension for which the fee was paid.
(3) At the time of payment of any impact fee under this section, the impact fee
administrator shall provide the applicant paying such fee with written notice
of those circumstances under which refunds of such fees will be made. Failure
to deliver such written notice shall not invalidate any collection of any impact
fee under this section.
K. Credits
(1) Credit against the road and park impact fees shall be provided for
contributions toward the cost of major roadway and park system
improvements.
a. Approved credits for the major roadway and park system improvements
shall generally become effective when the improvements have been
completed and have been accepted by the City Council under the
provisions of a prior agreement. All impact fee credits shall have a
reading at one regularly scheduled City Council meeting prior to its
passage and approval at any subsequent regularly scheduled City
Council meeting. (#O-04-38)
72
b. No credit will be applied to the road impact fee for dedication of rightof-
way, since no right-of-way costs were included in the calculation of
the road impact fee. No credit will be applied to the road impact fee
for improvements to the major roadway system that primarily serve
traffic generated by the applicant's project, such as
acceleration/deceleration lanes into and out of the project.
c. Credit for park land dedication shall be based on the value of the land
to be dedicated. The value of any land required to be dedicated shall
be based upon the "fair market value" of the land at the time of filing
the final plat. The value shall be determined by a certified appraiser
who is selected and paid for by the applicant, and who uses generally
accepted appraisal techniques. If the City disagrees with the appraised
value, the City may engage another appraiser at the City's expense, and
the value shall be an amount equal to the average of the two appraisals.
If either party rejects the average of the two appraisals, a third
appraisal shall be obtained, with the cost of such third appraisal being
borne by the party rejecting the average. The third appraiser shall be
selected by the first two appraisers, and the third appraisal shall be
binding on both parties. Approved credits for dedicated park land shall
become effective when the land has been conveyed to the City and has
been accepted by the City.
(2) In order to receive credit for major roadway and park system improvements,
the developer shall submit complete engineering drawings, specifications, and
construction cost estimates to the impact fee administrator. The impact fee
administrator shall determine the amount of credit due based on the
information submitted, or where such information is inaccurate or unreliable,
then on alternative engineering or construction costs acceptable to the impact
fee administrator.
(3) To qualify for an impact fee credit, the developer must enter into an agreement
with the City as approved by the City Council. The developer agreement shall
specify the following:
a. The amount of the credit;
73
b. How the credit will be allocated by the developer. (#O-19-27)
(4) Unless otherwise specified in a developer agreement, in the event that the
impact-generating development for which credits have been issued is sold to
different owners, the credits usable by each new owner shall be calculated in
terms of a percentage of the impact fees that would otherwise be due from the
entire development. If the total amount of development is not known, the
maximum potential development under existing development regulations shall
be assumed. This percentage reduction will be applied to all impact fees
assessed within the development until the total amount of the credits is
exhausted. (#O-19-27)
(5) The right to claim credits shall run with the land and may be claimed only by
owners of property within the development for which the land was dedicated
or the improvement was made. Credits issued for a particular development
may be assigned to another development if specified in an approved developer
agreement. (#O-19-27)
(6) Credits provided pursuant to this section shall be valid from the effective date
of such credits until ten (10) years after such date. (#O-19-27)
(7) Applicants may also obtain credits for major roadway and park system
improvements completed prior to the effective date of this section, and may use
such credits to reduce the impact fees due after the effective date of this section
for major roadway and park system improvements within the same impactgenerating
development for which the credits were issued. Application for
such credits must be made, on forms provided by the City, within two (2) years
after the effective date of this section. In the event that the impact-generating
development for which the credits are claimed is partially completed, the
amount of the credits shall be reduced by the amount of the impact fees for
major roadway and park system improvements that would have been charged
for the completed portion of the development had this section been in effect. In
the event that the impact-generating development project has been fully
completed, no credits shall be issued. (#O-04-38)
74
L. Miscellaneous Provisions
(1) Nothing in this section shall restrict the City from requiring the construction
of reasonable project improvements required to serve the development project,
whether or not such improvement are of a type for which credits are available
under subsection K, Credits.
(2) The impact fee administrator shall maintain accurate records of the impact
fees paid, including the name of the person paying such fees, the project for
which the fees were paid, the date of payment of each fee, the amounts received
in payment for each fee, and any other matters that the City deems appropriate
or necessary to the accurate accounting of such fees. Records shall be
available for review by the public during normal business hours and with
reasonable advance notice.
(3) Upon request by the City Council, the impact fee administrator shall present
to the City Council a proposed capital improvements program that shall assign
monies from each impact fee fund to specific projects and related expenses for
eligible improvements of the type for which the fees in that fund were paid. Any
monies, including any accrued interest, not assigned to specific projects within
such capital improvements program and not expended pursuant to subsection
J, Refunds, or subsection K, Credits, or subsection L(4) below shall be retained
in the same impact fee fund until the next fiscal year.
(4) The City shall be entitled to retain not more than two percent (2%) of each
impact fee collected as payment for the expenses of collecting the fee and
administering this section. In the case of refunds of impact fees under
subsection J, Refunds, the City shall be entitled to retain not more than an
additional two percent (2%) of the impact fee payment made by the applicant
as payment for the expenses of processing the reimbursement request.
(5) If a impact fee has been calculated and paid based on a mistake or
misrepresentation, it shall be recalculated.
a. Any amounts overpaid by an applicant shall be refunded by the impact
fee administrator to the applicant within thirty (30) days after the
acceptance of the recalculated amount, with interest since the date of
such overpayment.
b. Any amounts underpaid by the applicant shall be paid to the impact fee
administrator within thirty (30) days after the acceptance of the
recalculated amount, with interest since the date of such underpayment.
c. In the case of an underpayment to the impact fee administrator, the City
shall not issue any additional permits or approvals for the project for
which the impact fee was previously underpaid until such
75
underpayment is corrected, and if amounts owed to the City are not
paid within such thirty (30) day period, the City may also rescind any
permits issued in reliance on the previous payment of such impact fee.
(6) The impact fees and the administrative procedures established by this section
shall be reviewed at least once every three (3) years.
M. Appeals
Any determination made by the impact fee administrator charged with the
administration of any part of this section may be appealed to the City Council within
thirty (30) days from the date of the decision to be appealed.
N. Violation
Furnishing false information on any matter relating to the administration of this
section, including without limitation the furnishing of false information regarding the
expected size, use, or impacts from a proposed development, shall be a violation of
this section.
O. Effective Date
The provisions of this section shall take effect September 1, 2003, and from that date,
the provisions herein shall be controlling within the limits of said city. (#O-03-98)

ARTICLE VII
LOT SPLITS & MINOR SUBDIVISIONS
SECTION 1. DEFINITION
This section of the land Subdivision Regulations is designed to expedite the platting and
recording of minor subdivisions and lot splits but shall be permissive and not mandatory. By
definition, a lot split is a subdivision which involves the dividing or redividing of a land area
of one or more lots within not more than one (1) block of a recorded subdivision and which
does not involve the dedicating, vacating, widening, narrowing, or change of alignment of any
thoroughfare, street or alley or the vacating, narrowing or change of alignment of any
easement and does not require the construction of any public streets or utilities. For the
purpose of effectuating this section of the code, a subdivision is considered a minor
"subdivision" when it contains four (4) or fewer lots and no streets, utilities, or other
improvements are required to be made. The lot size and building setback requirements stated
above in Article IV, Section 5 apply to lot splits and minor subdivisions.
SECTION 2. PROCEDURE
(1) When a lot split or minor subdivision as defined above is involved, a subdivider shall
prepare and submit to the Planning Director an application for approval of lot split or
minor subdivision.
(2) The application shall not be accepted until the subdivider has paid the application fee set
forth in Article VI, Section 3.
(3) The subdivider shall prepare the application as a Final Plat to include all information
required in Article II, Sections 3 and 4 except none of the preliminary certificates are
required and the Certificate of Final Plat Approval will be signed by the Conway
Planning Director. Three (3) Five (5) copies shall be submitted for initial review, and
the original tracing or reproducible mylar and nine (9) twelve (12) copies shall be
submitted for filing. All other requirements shall be the same as those in Article II,
Section 4. (# O-02-79)
(4) The Planning Director is hereby authorized to review the application for approval of a
lot split or minor subdivision and provide approval. The Planning Director shall inform
the full Planning Commission at the next regular meeting that approval has been granted
to the lot split or minor subdivision.
77
(5) Approval or disapproval of lot splits and minor subdivisions shall be given based on the
following guidelines:
a. No new street or alley is required.
b. No vacation of streets, alleys, setback lines, access control or easements is required
or proposed.
c. Such action will not result in any significant increases in public service
requirements, nor will it interfere with maintaining existing public service levels.
d. There is adequate street right-of-way as required by this chapter and the master
street plan or the additional right-of-way to fulfill those requirements is dedicated
on this plat. (#O-01-36)
e. All easement requirements have been satisfied.
f. All lots created by such split shall have direct access to a public street according
to the provisions of this chapter.
g. No substandard lots or parcels shall be created, except the Planning Director may
approve lots which are less than 100 feet in depth at their shallowest point and/or
have side lot lines that are not perpendicular or radial to front lot lines and/or
double frontage lots and/or may approve existing buildings which are less than the
required yard setback from existing lot lines when, in his professional opinion, any
such lots are buildable and platting such lots will create no problems for the owner
of such lots or surrounding property owners. For double frontage lots, the Planning
Director may require that access be denied such lots from one frontage and may
require a ten (10) foot planting reservation across such frontage.
78

ARTICLE IX
LOT MERGERS
SECTION 1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this Article is to establish procedures other than formal replatting to allow for
the merger of lots.
SECTION 2. DEFINITION
For the purposes of Article IX, lot mergers shall be defined as the joining together of any
number of platted lots to form a single lot. If the procedures established in Article IX are
followed and the lots have been configured and recorded in such a way as to allow the merger,
they may be merged without following the replatting procedures established elsewhere in this
Subdivision Ordinance. Upon such merger, any dividing lot lines existing prior to the merger
that have been removed by the merger shall be considered nonexistent and shall not be
considered in any of the requirements of the Conway Subdivision Ordinance, the Conway
Zoning Ordinance or any building codes adopted by the City of Conway. Following such a
merger, no sale of any portion of the new lot, other than the entire lot, shall take place without
the completion, approval by the Planning Commission or Planning Director and filing with
the county of a replat to divide the merged lot into two or more legal lots.
Lot mergers under Article IX shall not be used to remove or dedicate any easements or any
rights-of-way. If the removal or dedication of any easements or rights-of-way are to take
place, they must be accomplished through procedures delineated elsewhere in this Ordinance
or through other legal avenues, such as the removal of an easement by passage of an
ordinance by the City Council.
SECTION 3. PROCEDURES
(1) When a lot merger as defined above is involved, an applicant shall prepare and submit to
the Planning Director an application for approval of a lot merger.
(2) The application shall not be accepted until the applicant has paid a fee of $200.00. All
recording fees shall be paid by the subdivider. (#O-07-121)
81
(3) The applicant shall prepare the application to include all the information required in
SECTION 4. APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS as shown below.
(4) The Planning Director is hereby authorized to review the application for a lot merger and
provide approval or disapproval. Upon approval, the lot merger shall be filed with
Faulkner County. The Planning Director shall inform the full Planning Commission at
the next regular meeting if approval is granted for the lot merger.
(5) Approval or disapproval of the lot merger shall be given based on the following
guidelines:
a. No new street or alley is required.
b. No dedication or vacation of streets, alleys, setback lines, access control or easements
is required or proposed.
c. Such action will not result in any significant increases in public service requirements,
nor will it interfere with maintaining existing public service levels.
d. There is adequate street right-of-way as required by this Ordinance and the Master
Street Plan.
e. All lots created by such lot merger shall have direct access to a public street according
to the provisions of this Ordinance.
f. No substandard lots shall be created, except the Planning Director may approve lots
which are less than one hundred (100) feet in depth at their shallowest point and/or
have side lot lines that are not perpendicular or radial to front lot lines and/or double
frontage lots and/or may approve existing buildings that are less than the required
yard setback from existing lot lines when, in his professional opinion, any such lots
are buildable and platting such will create no problems for the owner of such lots or
surrounding property owners.
