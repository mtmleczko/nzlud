PREFACE 
    This publication constitutes a codification of the Charter, Code of Ordinances, and Land Development Regulations of the City of Milton, Florida. 
    The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Part. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this publication, the reader can locate any section of any ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code of Ordinances have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the publication is included at the back of this publication. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in the Code of Ordinances is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this publication is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code of Ordinances, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this publication at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 SPECIAL LAWS SL:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 LAND DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS LDR1:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER AND SPECIAL LAWS INDEX CHTi:1 CODE/LDR INDEX CD/LDRi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments

    The purpose of this article is to promote appropriate communications between the public and city officials. 
(Ord. No. 949, § 1, 12-12-1995) 
Sec. 2-586. - Discussions with city officials. 
(a)  Any person not otherwise prohibited by statute, Charter provision, or ordinance may discuss with any city official the merits of any matter on which action may be taken by any board or commission on which the local public official is a member. However: 
(1)  The substance of any ex parte communication with a city official which relates to quasi-judicial action pending before the official is not presumed prejudicial to the action if the subject of the communication and the identity of the person, group, or entity with whom the communication took place is disclosed and made a part of the record before final action on the matter. 
(2)  A city official may read a written communication from any person. However, a written communication that relates to a quasi-judicial action pending before a city official shall not be presumed prejudicial to the action, and such written communication shall be made a part of the record before final action on the matter. 
(3)  City officials may conduct investigations and site visits and may receive expert opinions regarding any quasi-judicial action pending before them. Such activities shall not be presumed prejudicial to the action if the existence of the investigation, site visit, or expert opinion is made a part of the record before final action on the matter. 
(4)  Disclosure made pursuant to subsections (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section must be made before or during the public meeting at which a vote is taken on such matters, so that persons who have opinions contrary to those expressed in the ex parte communication are given a reasonable opportunity to refute or respond to the communication. This section does not subject local public officials to F.S. §§ 112.311-112.326 for not complying with this subsection. 
(b)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the following procedures and provisions are established for quasi-judicial proceedings on local government land use matters: 
(1)  In a quasi-judicial proceeding on local government land use matters, a person who appears before the decision-making body who is not a party or party-intervenor shall be allowed to testify before the decision-making body, subject to control by the decision-making body, and may be requested to respond to questions from the decision-making body, but need not be sworn as a witness, is not required to be subject to cross examination, and is not required to be qualified as an expert witness. The decision-making body shall assign weight and credibility to such testimony as it deems appropriate. A party or party-intervenor in a quasi-judicial proceeding on local government land use matters, upon request by another party or party-intervenor, shall be sworn as a witness, shall be subject to cross examination by other parties or party-intervenors, and shall be required to be qualified as an expert witness, as appropriate. 
(2)  In a quasi-judicial proceeding on local government land use matters, a person may not be precluded from communicating directly with a member of the decision-making body by application of ex parte communication prohibitions. Disclosure of such communications by a member of the decision-making body is not required, and such nondisclosure shall not be presumed prejudicial to the decision of the decision-making body. All decisions of the decision-making body in a quasi-judicial proceeding on local government land use matters must be supported by substantial, competent evidence in the record pertinent to the proceeding, irrespective of such communications. 
(c)  This section does not restrict the authority of any board or commission to establish rules or procedures governing public hearings or contacts with local public officials.

Sec. 2-660. - Findings. 
    It is hereby ascertained, determined, and declared that: 
(1)  Pursuant to Article VIII, Section 2(b) of the Florida Constitution, and F.S. §§ 166.021 and 166.041, the city council has all powers of local self-government to perform municipal functions and render municipal services except when expressly prohibited by law and such power may be exercised by the enactment of city ordinances. 
(2)  The city council may exercise any governmental, corporate, or proprietary power for a municipal purpose except when expressly prohibited by law, and the city council may legislate on any subject matter on which the Florida Legislature may act, except those subjects described in (a), (b), (c), and (d) of F.S. § 166.021(3). The subject matter of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of F.S. § 166.021(3), is not relevant to the imposition of assessments related to fire protection services, facilities or programs. 
(3)  The special benefits to affected lands provided as a result of an assessment include by way of example and not limitation, the constant and continual availability and use of fire protection services to each tax parcel within the city, protection of public safety, stable or decreasing insurance costs, a potential increase in value to property, and an assured level of service to landowners and tenants. 
(4)  The constant and continued preparedness to provide fire protection services, facilities, and programs possess a logical relationship to the value, use, and enjoyment of real property by: 
a.  Protecting the value of the improvements and structures through the continual availability of fire control and provision of fire protection and associated rescue services; 
b.  Protecting the life and safety of intended occupants in the use and enjoyment of real property; 
c.  Lowering the cost of fire insurance by the presence of a professional and comprehensive fire protection and associated rescue program within the city; 
d.  Providing protection for uninsured and underinsured property and property owners; and 
e.  Containing the spread of fire incidents, sometimes occurring on vacant or undeveloped property, with the potential to spread and endanger the structures and occupants of nearby improved property, thereby limiting liability. 
(5)  The combined fire control and associated first responder/basic life support emergency medical services of the city, under its existing consolidated fire protection program, enhances and strengthens the relationship of such services to the value, use and enjoyment of the parcels of property within the city. 
(6)  The assessment imposed pursuant to this division is imposed by the city council, not the property appraiser or tax collector. Any activity of the property appraiser or tax collector under the provisions of this division shall be construed as ministerial. 
(7)  The annual assessments to be imposed pursuant to this division are special assessments and may also constitute and be described as non-ad valorem assessments within the meaning and intent of the Uniform Collection Act. 
(8)  The purpose of this division is to: (1) provide procedure and standards for the imposition of city-wide assessments under the home rule powers of a municipality to impose special assessments, (2) authorize a procedure for the funding of fire protection services, facilities, or programs, providing special benefits to property within the city, and (3) establish a significant tax equity tool which can be used to reduce a dependence on property taxes as a source of funding for fire protection services, facilities, and programs, reduce demand on other legally available funds, allow for local policy discretion as difficult overall budget choices are made by the city council each year, and give the community a more equitable, balanced, sustainable, and dedicated means of funding essential fire protection related services and capital improvements.

Subdivision II. - Annual Fire Services Assessments 

Sec. 2-664. - General authority. 
(a)  The city council is hereby authorized to impose an annual assessment to fund all or any portion of the fire services assessed cost upon benefitted property at a rate of assessment based on the special benefit accruing to such property from the city's provision of fire protection services, facilities, and programs. For purposes of this division, references to "benefit", "special benefit" "benefited property" or the like also include the relief of burden to continually stand in readiness created by real property as well as improvements thereon. All assessments shall be imposed in conformity with the procedures set forth in this subdivision II. 
(b)  The amount of the annual assessment imposed each fiscal year against each parcel of assessed property shall be determined pursuant to an apportionment methodology based upon a fair and reasonable apportionment of the fire service assessed cost among properties on a basis reasonably related to the special benefit provided by the availability of fire protection services, facilities, or programs funded with assessment proceeds. The amount of the annual assessment imposed each fiscal year may include administration and collection costs associated with the annual assessment. In the event the assessments are collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the amount of the annual assessment may also include fees imposed by the property appraiser and tax collector and will be adjusted as necessary to account for any statutory discounts which are necessitated when employing the efficiencies of collecting the assessments annually on the same bill as property taxes. 
(Ord. No. 1428-16 , § 2.1, 2-9-2016) 
Sec. 2-665. - Proceedings. 
    The proceedings for the imposition of an assessment shall include a public hearing noticed in the manner set forth in section 2-667 hereof, and the adoption at or anytime thereafter of an annual assessment resolution which shall: 
(1)  Contain a brief and general description of the fire protection services, facilities, or programs to be provided or made available; 
(2)  Describe the method or methods of apportioning the fire services assessed cost among affected tax parcels; 
(3)  Describe the tax parcels, if any, to be exempted from the fire services assessment for legal or public policy purposes; 
(4)  Identify the rate or rates of assessment and approve and adopt the annual assessment roll, consistent with the requirements of section 2-666 hereof; and 
(5)  Determine the method of collecting the fire services assessment. 
(Ord. No. 1428-16 , § 2.2, 2-9-2016) 
Sec. 2-666. - Assessment roll. 
(a)  The assessment coordinator shall prepare, or direct the preparation of, the assessment roll, which shall contain the following: 
(1)  A summary description of all assessed property by tax parcel conforming to the description contained on the tax roll. 
(2)  The name of the owner of the assessed property. 
(3)  The extension or application of the rates of the proposed Assessment to be imposed against each such tax parcel of assessed property.

(Ord. No. 1428-16 , § 2.3, 2-9-2016) 
Sec. 2-667. - Notice. 
    At least 30 days prior to the public hearing, the city shall publish notice of the public hearing in a newspaper generally circulated within the boundaries of the county. The notice shall provide the date, time, and place of the hearing. The notice shall contain a general statement that the city council will consider a special assessment throughout the city on the various parcels of property within the city to fund all or a portion of the costs of the continual availability of and the provision of fire protection services, facilities, and programs; the proposed rates or explanation of the schedule of assessments; general information pertaining to the proposed apportionment methodology, the method of collection, and a statement that all affected property owners have a right to appear at the public hearing and the right to file written objections within 20 days of the publication of the notice. The notice shall direct all interested persons to the assessment roll and information concerning the amount of the proposed assessment applicable to each parcel of property. 
(Ord. No. 1428-16 , § 2.4, 2-9-2016) 
Sec. 2-668. - Annual assessment resolution. 
    At the time named in such notice, or to which an adjournment or continuance may be taken by the city council, the city council shall receive any oral or written comments or objections of interested parties and may then, or at any subsequent meeting of the city council, adopt the annual assessment resolution which shall (a) establish the rate or rates of assessment to be imposed in the designated fiscal year; (b) approve and adopt the assessment roll, with such amendments and directions as it deems just and right; and (c) provide direction as to the method of collection. All parcels assessed shall derive a special benefit from the fire protection service, facilities, or programs to be provided or constructed and the assessment shall be fairly and reasonably apportioned between the properties that receive the special benefit.

The annual assessment resolution as confirmed shall constitute the final action necessary to impose or re-impose assessments hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 1428-16 , § 2.5, 2-9-2016) 
Sec. 2-669. - Effect of annual assessment resolution. 
    The assessments for the initial fiscal year and each subsequent fiscal year shall be established upon adoption and confirmation of the annual assessment resolution. The adoption and confirmation of the annual assessment resolution shall be the final adjudication of the issues presented (including, but not limited to, the method of apportionment and assessment, the rate or rates of assessment, the assessment roll, and the levy and lien of the assessments), unless proper steps shall be initiated in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure relief within 20 days from the date of the city council action adopting and confirming on the annual assessment resolution. The initial assessment roll, as approved by the annual assessment resolution, shall be delivered for collection using the uniform method of collection described in section 2-680 hereof to collect the assessments, or such other method as the city council by resolution shall designate. 
(Ord. No. 1428-16 , § 2.6, 2-9-2016) 
Sec. 2-670. - Adoption of subsequent annual assessment resolutions. 
    The city council may adopt subsequent annual assessment resolutions as a part of and during its budget adoption process for each fiscal year following the initial fiscal year for which an assessment is imposed hereunder. The annual assessment resolution shall approve the assessment roll for the upcoming fiscal year. The assessment roll may be prepared in accordance with the methods of apportionment set forth in the prior assessment resolution but may include modifications as a matter of policy as to what, if any, portion or portions of the city's budget is paid for from legally available funds other than assessment revenues. Failure to adopt an annual assessment resolution during the budget adoption process may be cured at any time. 
(Ord. No. 1428-16 , § 2.7, 2-9-2016) 
Sec. 2-671. - Alternative use of Uniform Assessment Collection Act. 
(a)  The city council may decide to use the uniform method of collection provided for in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; provided, however that all of the procedures required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act can be and are timely complied with. 
(b)  If the city council decides to use the uniform method of collection provided for in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the assessment coordinator shall publish notice which shall conform to the requirements set forth in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act and, in addition to the requirements set forth in this division, the assessment coordinator shall provide notice of the proposed assessment by first class mail to the owner of each parcel subject to the assessment which shall conform to the requirements set forth in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Such mailed notice may be provided by including the assessment in the property appraisers notice of proposed property taxes and proposed or adopted non-ad valorem assessments under F.S. § 200.069 or its successor in function. The assessment coordinator may provide proof of such notice by affidavit. Failure of the owner to receive notice due to mistake or inadvertence shall nevertheless not affect the validity of the assessment roll nor release or discharge any obligation for payment of an assessment imposed by the city council pursuant to this division. 
(c)  The city council may also establish by resolution such reasonable procedures or directions to confirm and comply with the Uniform Assessment Collection Act as may be practicable and necessary. 
(d)  Nothing herein shall preclude the city council from establishing by resolution a maximum rate of assessment provided that notice of such maximum assessment rate is provided pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. In the event that the uniform method of collection provided for in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act is used and: 
(1)  The proposed assessment for any fiscal year exceeds the maximum rate of assessment adopted by the city council and included in notice previously provided to the owners of assessed property pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; 
(2)  The method of apportionment is changed or the purpose for which the assessment is imposed is substantially changed from that represented by notice previously provided to the owners of assessed property pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; 
(3)  Assessed property is reclassified in a manner which results in an increased assessment from that represented by notice previously provided to the owners of assessed property pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; or 
(4)  An assessment roll contains assessed property that was not included on the assessment roll approved for the prior fiscal year, notice and opportunity to be heard shall be provided to the owners of such assessed property. 
Such notice shall substantially conform to the notice requirements set forth in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act and inform the owner of the time, date, and place for adoption of the annual assessment resolution. The failure of the owner to receive such notice due to mistake or inadvertence shall not affect the validity of the assessment roll nor release or discharge any obligation for payment of an assessment imposed by the city council pursuant to this division. 
(e)  The assessment roll, as approved by the annual assessment resolution, shall be certified and delivered to the tax collector as required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. 
(Ord. No. 1428-16 , § 2.8, 2-9-2016) 
Sec. 2-672. - Lien of fire services assessments. 
    Upon the adoption of the assessment roll, all assessments shall constitute a lien against such property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district, or municipal taxes and special assessments. Except as otherwise provided by law, until paid such lien shall be superior in dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles, and claims. The lien for an assessment shall be deemed perfected upon adoption by the city council of the annual assessment resolution. The lien for an assessment collected under the uniform assessment collection method shall attach to the property included on the assessment roll as of the prior January 1, the lien date for ad valorem taxes imposed under the tax roll. The lien for an assessment collected under the direct billing method of collection shall be deemed perfected upon adoption by the city council of the annual assessment resolution, after a public hearing, and shall attach to the property on the date of each such annual assessment resolution. 
(Ord. No. 1428-16 , § 2.9, 2-9-2016) 
Sec. 2-673. - Revisions to fire services assessments. 
    If any assessment made pursuant to this division is either in whole or in part annulled, vacated, or set aside by the judgment of any court, or if the city council is satisfied that any such assessment is so irregular or defective that the same cannot be enforced or collected, or if the city council has omitted any property on the assessment roll which property should have been so included, the city council may take all necessary steps to impose a new assessment against any property benefited by the fire service assessed costs, following as nearly as may be practicable, the provisions of the division and in case such second assessment is annulled, vacated, or set aside, the city council may obtain and impose other assessments until a valid assessment is imposed. 
(Ord. No. 1428-16 , § 2.10, 2-9-2016) 
Sec. 2-674. - Procedural irregularities. 
    Any informality or irregularity in the proceedings in connection with the levy of any assessment pursuant to this division shall not affect the validity of the same after the approval thereof, and any assessment as finally approved shall be competent and sufficient evidence that such assessment was duly levied, that the assessment was duly made and adopted, and that all other proceedings adequate to such assessment were duly had, taken, and performed as required by this division; and no variance from the directions hereunder shall be held material unless it be clearly shown that the party objecting was materially injured thereby. Notwithstanding the provisions of the section, any party objecting to an assessment imposed pursuant to this division must file an objection with a court of competent jurisdiction within the time periods prescribed herein. 
(Ord. No. 1428-16 , § 2.11, 2-9-2016) 
Sec. 2-675. - Corrections of errors and omissions. 
(a)  No act of error or omission on the part of the property appraiser, tax collector, assessment coordinator, city council, or their deputies, employees, or agents shall operate to release or discharge any obligation for payment of an assessment imposed by the city council pursuant to this division. 
(b)  When it shall appear that any assessment should have been imposed pursuant to this division against a parcel of property specially benefited by the provision of fire protection services, facilities, or programs, but that such property was omitted from the assessment roll, the city council may, upon provision of notice to the owner by first class mail, impose the applicable assessment for the fiscal year such error is discovered, in addition to the applicable assessment due for the prior two fiscal years. Such total assessment shall become delinquent if not fully paid upon the expiration of 60 days from the date of the adoption of said resolution. The assessment so imposed shall constitute a lien against such property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district, or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles, and claims in and to or against the real property involved and may be collected as provided in subdivision III hereof. 
(c)  The assessment coordinator shall have the authority at any time, upon his or her own initiative or in response to a timely filed petition from the owner of any property subject to an assessment, based upon presentation of competent and substantial evidence, to correct any error in annually applying the assessment apportionment method to any particular parcel of property not otherwise requiring the provision of mailed notice pursuant to this division or the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Additionally, because the size and nature of the tax roll may yield anomalies, the assessment coordinator is authorized to apply sound public administration judgment and delete or remove individual tax parcels from the assessment roll that, due to specific circumstances, do not receive a special benefit, are not developable (e.g. subsurface rights, submerged, slivers, rights-of-way, common elements) or are reasonably determined to be inappropriate, infeasible or impracticable to assess, and do not merit the expenditure of public funds and resources to impose or collect such assessments. Any such corrections shall be considered valid ab initio and shall in no way affect the enforcement of the assessment imposed under the provisions of this division. All requests from affected property owners for any such changes, modification or corrections shall be referred to, and processed by, the assessment coordinator and not the property appraiser or tax collector. 
(d)  After the assessment roll has been delivered to the tax collector in accordance with the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, any changes, modifications, or corrections thereto shall be made in accordance with the procedures applicable to correcting errors and insolvencies on the tax roll upon timely written request and direction of the assessment coordinator. 
(Ord. No. 1428-16 , § 2.12, 2-9-2016) 
Sec. 2-676. - Interim assessments. 
(a)  An interim assessment shall be imposed against all property for which a certificate of occupancy is issued after adoption and confirmation of the annual assessment resolution. The amount of the interim assessment shall be calculated upon a monthly rate, which shall be one-twelfth of the annual rate for such property computed in accordance with the annual assessment resolution for the fiscal year in which the certificate of occupancy is issued. Such monthly rate shall be imposed for each full calendar month remaining in the fiscal year. In addition to the monthly rate, the interim assessment may also include an estimate of the subsequent year's assessment. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until full payment of the interim assessment is received by the city. Issuance of the certificate of occupancy by mistake or inadvertence, and without the payment in full of the interim assessment, shall not relieve the owner of such property of the obligation of full payment. For the purpose of this provision, such interim assessment shall be deemed due and payable on the date of certificate of occupancy was issued and shall constitute a lien against such property as of that date. Said lien shall be equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles and claims in and to or against the real property involved. 
(b)  Exclusive of property for which an interim assessment was paid pursuant to subsection (a) hereof, an interim assessment shall be imposed against any property which for any reason was omitted from the fire service assessment roll or was not listed on the tax roll as an individual tax parcel as of the effective date of the assessment roll approved by the annual assessment resolution for any upcoming fiscal year. For the purpose of this provision, such interim assessment shall be deemed due and payable and shall constitute a lien against such property for which it is imposed. Said lien shall be equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles and claims in and to or against the real property involved. 
(Ord. No. 1428-16 , § 2.13, 2-9-2016) 
Sec. 2-677. - Authorization of exemption and residential deferral program. 
(a)  The city council, in its sole discretion, shall determine whether to provide any exemption or residential deferral program. 
(b)  The city council shall designate other available funds for the provision of any exemption or residential deferral program upon the decision to enact such an exemption or program. 
(c)  The provision of any exemption or residential deferral in any one year shall in no way establish a right or entitlement to such exemption or deferral in any subsequent year and the provision of funds in any year may be limited to the extent that funds are available and appropriated by the city council. 
(Ord. No. 1428-16 , § 2.14, 2-9-2016) 
Subdivision III. - Collection of Fire Service Assessments 

Sec. 2-678. - Collection. 
(a)  The process of collection is driven by many equitable, practical and economic factors. The traditional direct billing method provides fair and adequate notice and opportunity to be heard through publication in a newspaper of general circulation. The individually mailed notice required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act shall be included on the same bill as for ad valorem taxes. 
(b)  Unless otherwise directed by city council, the assessments shall be collected pursuant to the uniform assessment collection method provided in section 2-680 hereof. Any hearing or notice required by this division may be combined with any other hearing or notice required by this division or the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. 
(Ord. No. 1428-16 , § 3.1, 2-9-2016)

a.  A brief explanation of the assessment; 
b.  The assessment; 
c.  The number of units contained within the tax parcel; 
d.  The rate or rates applied to the units of measurement or method and the total amount of the assessment imposed against the tax parcel for the appropriate period; 
e.  The location at which payment will be accepted; 
f.  The date on which the assessment is due; and 
g.  A statement that the assessment constitutes a lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and other non-ad valorem assessments. 
(2)  A general notice of the lien resulting from imposition of the assessments throughout the city may be recorded in the official records of the county. Nothing herein shall be construed to require that individual liens or releases be filed in the official records. 
(3)  The city shall have the right to appoint or retain an agent to foreclose and collect all delinquent assessments in the manner provided by law. 
(4)  An assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within 30 days from the date any installment is due. The city or its agent shall notify any property owner who is delinquent in payment of his or her assessment within 90 days from the date such assessment was due. Such notice shall state in effect that the city or its agent may cause an amount equivalent to the delinquent assessment, not previously subject to collection using the uniform method under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, to be collected on the tax bill for a subsequent year or pursue any other remedy permitted by law. 
(5)  All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related to any foreclosure action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein. At the sale pursuant to decree in any such action, the city may be the purchaser to the same extent as an individual person or corporation. The city may join in one foreclosure action the collection of assessments against any or all property assessed in accordance with the provisions hereof. All delinquent owners whose property is foreclosed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city and its agents, including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent assessments and any other costs incurred by the city as a result of such delinquent assessments and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, the costs of the action. 
(6)  In lieu of foreclosure, any delinquent assessment and the costs, fees and expenses otherwise reasonably attributable thereto, may be collected subsequently pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; provided however, that: 
a.  Notice is provided to the owner in the manner required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act and this division; and 
b.  Any existing lien of record on the affected parcel for the delinquent assessment is supplanted by the lien resulting from certification of the assessment roll, as applicable, to the tax collector. 
(7)  Any city council action required in the collection of assessments may be by resolution. 
(Ord. No. 1428-16 , § 3.2, 2-9-2016) 
Sec. 2-680. - Uniform method of collection. 
(a)  In lieu of utilizing any other method of collection available to the city, the city may elect to collect assessments using the uniform method pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; and, for any specific parcel of benefitted property may include an amount equivalent to the payment delinquency, delinquency fees and expenses and recording costs for a prior year's assessment for a comparable service, facility, or program provided: 
(1)  The collection method used in connection with the prior year's assessment did not employ the use of the uniform method of collection authorized by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; 
(2)  Notice is provided to the owner; and 
(3)  Any lien on the affected parcel for the prior year's assessment is supplanted and transferred to such assessment upon certification of a non-ad valorem roll to the tax collector by the city. 
(b)  If the city council determines the assessments are to be collected on the same bill as for ad valorem taxes, then the assessment coordinator shall comply and conform to the requirements of the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. 
(Ord. No. 1428-16 , § 3.3, 2-9-2016) 
Sec. 2-681. - Government property. 
(a)  To the extent permitted by law, the city reserves the right to impose a charge or fee comparable in amount to assessments on governmental property. As used in this section, the context of the term "assessment" shall refer to such a charge or fee. As to assessments imposed against government property, the city shall provide assessment bills by first class mail to the owner or agent of each affected parcel of government property. The bill or accompanying explanatory material shall include: 
(1)  A brief explanation of the assessment; 
(2)  A description of the unit of measurement used to determine the amount of the assessment; 
(3)  The number of units contained within the tax parcel; 
(4)  The rate or rates applicable to the units of measurement or method and the total amount of the assessment imposed against the tax parcel for the appropriate period; 
(5)  The location at which payment will be accepted; and 
(6)  The date on which the assessment is due. 
(b)  Assessments imposed against government property shall be due on the same date as all other assessments and, if applicable, shall be subject to the same discounts for early payment. 
(c)  An assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within 30 days from the date any installment is due. The city may notify the owner of any government property that is delinquent in payment of its assessment within 90 days from the date such assessment was due. Such notice shall state that the city will initiate a mandamus or other appropriate judicial action to compel payment. 
(d)  All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related to any mandamus or other action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein. All delinquent owners of government property against which a mandamus or other appropriate action is filed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city, including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent assessments and any other costs incurred by the city as a result of such delinquent assessments and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, the costs of the action. 
(e)  As an alternative to the foregoing, an assessment imposed against government property may be collected as a surcharge on a utility bill provided to such government property in 12 installments with a remedy of a mandamus action in the event of non-payment. The city council may also contract for such billing services with any utility not otherwise owned by the city. 
(Ord. No. 1428-16 , § 3.4, 2-9-2016) 
Subdivision IV. - Issuance of Obligations 

Sec. 2-682. - Notes. 
    In anticipation of the sale of obligations, the city council may, by ordinance or resolution, issue notes and may renew the same from time to time. Such notes may be paid from the proceeds of the obligations, the proceeds of the assessments, the proceeds of the notes and such other legally available moneys as the city council deems appropriate by ordinance or resolution. 
(Ord. No. 1428-16 , § 4.1, 2-9-2016) 
Secs. 2-683-2-690. - Reserved. 
DIVISION 4. - INVESTMENT POLICY 

Sec. 2-691. - Policy. 
    It is the policy of the City of Milton to invest public funds in a manner which will provide the highest investment return with the maximum security while meeting the daily cash flow demands of the city and conforming to all state and local statutes governing the investment of public funds. Cash may, at the discretion of the city clerk, be invested separately by fund or be commingled into a common investment portfolio and earning from such portfolio distributed at least quarterly. The city clerk has been authorized by ordinance to manage the investments described herein. 
(Ord. No. 1331-10, § 1(Exh. A), 4-13-2010) 
Sec. 2-692. - Scope. 
    This investment policy, which was adopted on the date hereof by the Milton City Council in Ordinance No. 1331-10 supersedes any previous investment policy and applies to all financial assets of the city, except the general employee, police pension, firemen's pension fund and retired employees health insurance fund, which are covered in separate investment policies. These funds are accounted for in the city's comprehensive annual financial report and include: 
    Funds. 
(1)  General fund. 
(2)  Special revenue funds. 
(3)  Debt service funds. 
(4)  Capital projects funds. 
(5)  Enterprise funds. 
(6)  Internal service funds. 
(7)  Fiduciary funds including pension trust funds, expendable trust funds and agency funds, excluding the general employee, police pension fund and the firemen's pension fund that falls under a separate investment policy. 
(Ord. No. 1331-10, § 1(Exh. A), 4-13-2010) 
Sec. 2-693. - Prudence. 
    Investments shall be made with the judgment and care-under circumstances then prevailing-which persons of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not for speculation, but for investment, considering the probable safety of their capital as well as the probable income to be derived. 
    The standard of prudence to be used by the city clerk shall be the "prudent person" and/or "prudent investor" standard and shall be applied in the context of managing an overall portfolio. The city clerk acting in accordance with written procedures and the investment policy and exercising due diligence shall be relieved of personal responsibility for an individual security's credit risk change or market price changes, provided deviations from expectations are reported to the mayor in a timely fashion and appropriate action is taken to control adverse developments. 
(Ord. No. 1331-10, § 1(Exh. A), 4-13-2010) 
Sec. 2-694. - Objectives. 
    The primary objectives, in priority order, of the city's investment activities shall be as follows: 
(1)  Safety: Safety of principal is the foremost objective of the investment program. Investments of the city shall be undertaken in a manner that seeks to ensure the preservation of capital in the overall portfolio. To attain this objective, diversification is required in order that potential losses on individual securities do not exceed the income generated from the remainder of the portfolio. 
(2)  Liquidity: The city's investment portfolio will remain sufficiently liquid to enable the city to meet all operating requirements, which might be reasonably anticipated. 
(3)  Return on investment: The city's investment portfolio shall be designed with the objective of attaining a market rate of return throughout budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account the city's investment risk constraints and the cash flow characteristics of the portfolio. 
(4)  Social policy: Investment decisions shall further the city's social policies established by ordinances or city council resolutions. 
(Ord. No. 1331-10, § 1(Exh. A), 4-13-2010) 
Sec. 2-695. - Delegation of authority. 
    Authority to manage the city's investment program is derived from Ordinance No. 1331-10. Management responsibility for the investment program is hereby delegated to the city clerk who shall be responsible for all transactions undertaken and shall establish a system of controls to regulate the activities of subordinate officials, and their procedures in the absence of the city clerk. 
    The city clerk shall establish written investment policy procedures for the operation of the investment program consistent with this policy. The procedure should include reference to: PSA repurchase agreements, wire transfer agreements, banking service contracts and collateral/depository agreements. Such procedures shall include explicit delegation of authority to persons responsible for investment transactions. No person may engage in an investment transaction except as provided under the terms of this policy and the procedures established by the city clerk. 
(Ord. No. 1331-10, § 1(Exh. A), 4-13-2010) 
Sec. 2-696. - Ethics and conflicts of interest. 
    Officers and employees involved in the investment process shall refrain from personal business activity that could conflict with proper execution of the investment program, or which could impair their ability to make impartial investment decisions.

(Ord. No. 1150-04, § II, 6-8-2004) 
Sec. 8-42. - Purpose and findings. 
(a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses and related activities to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials. 
(b)  Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the city council, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v . Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v . American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976); and Barnes v . Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); Arcara v . Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697, (1986); California v . LaRue, 409 U.S. 109 (1972); Iacobucci v . City of Newport, Ky, 479 U.S. 92 (1986); United States v . O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367 (1968); DLS, Inc. v . City of Chattanooga, 107 F.3d 403 (6th Cir.1997); Kev, Inc. v . Kitsap County, 793 F.2d 1053 (9th Cir.1986); Hang On, Inc. v . City of Arlington, 65 F.3d 1248 (5th Cir.1995); and South Florida Free Beaches, Inc. v . City of Miami, 734 F.2d 608 (11th Cir.1984), as well as studies conducted in other cities including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; and Beaumont, Texas; and testimony presented in Pensacola, Florida; and findings reported in the Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986), the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), and statistics obtained from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the city council finds that: 
(1)  Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. 
(2)  Crime statistics show that all types of crimes, especially sexually-related crimes, occur with more frequency in neighborhoods where sexually oriented businesses are located. See e.g., the studies of the cities of Phoenix, Arizona; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Austin, Texas. 
(3)  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semiprivate booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows. See e.g. , California v . LaRue, 409 U.S. 109, 111 (1972); see also the Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377. 
(4)  Offering and providing such booths and/or cubicles encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. See, e.g., the Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 376-77. 
(5)  Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses, for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses. See e.g., Arcara v . Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697, 698 (1986); see also Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 376-77. 
(6)  At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, non A, non B amebiasis, salmonella infections, and shigella infections. See e.g., the Study of Fort Meyers, Florida. 
(7)  For the period 1985 through 1995, the total number of reported cases of AIDS in the United States caused by the immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was 523,056. See e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
(8)  As of December 31, 2002, there have been 90,438 reported cases of AIDS in the state. 
(9)  Since 1981 and to the present, there have been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for the HIV antibody in the state. 
(10)  The total number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the United States reported during the ten-year period 1985-1995 was 367,796. See e.g., Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
(11)  The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high level, with a total of 1,250,581 cases reported during the period 1993-1995. See e.g . , Statistics of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
(12)  The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of October 22, 1986, advised the American public that the AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through: 
a.  Sexual contact; 
b.  Intravenous drug use; 
c.  Exposure to infected blood and blood components; and 
d.  From an infected mother to her newborn. 
(13)  According to the best scientific evidence available, the AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. See e.g., Findings of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
(14)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. See e.g., Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377. 
(15)  Numerous studies and reports have determined that bodily fluids, including semen and urine, are found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view adult oriented films. See e.g., Final Report of the Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986) at 377. 
(16)  Nude dancing in adult establishments encourages prostitution, increases sexual assaults, and attracts other criminal activity. See e.g. , Barnes v . Glen Theatre, 501 U.S. 560, 583 (1991). 
(17)  Nude dancing in adult establishments increases the likelihood of drug dealing and drug use. See e.g., Kev, Inc. v . Kitsap County, 793 F.2d 1053, 1056 (9th Cir.1986). 
(18)  The findings noted in subsections (b)(1) through (b)(17) of this section raise substantial governmental concerns. 
(19)  Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
(20)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety, and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
(21)  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on the premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult establishments. 
(22)  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and criminal activity. 
(23)  It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity. 
(24)  The fact that an applicant for a sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexually-related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention to this article. 
(25)  The barring of such individuals from the operation of or employment in sexually oriented businesses for a period of ten years for a previous felony conviction serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. 
(26)  The general welfare, health, morals, and safety of the citizens of this city will be promoted by the enactment of this article.

DIVISION 3. - ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURE 

Sec. 20-81. - Initiation; notice of violation; repeat violations; transfer of property. 
(a)  It shall be the duty of the code inspector to initiate enforcement proceedings of the various codes; however, no member of a board shall have the power to initiate such enforcement proceedings. 
(b)  Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this section, if a violation of the codes is found, the code inspector shall notify the violator and give him a reasonable time to correct the violation. Should the violation continue beyond the time specified for correction, the code inspector shall notify an enforcement board and request a hearing. The code enforcement board, through its clerical staff, shall schedule a hearing, and written notice of such hearing shall be hand delivered or mailed as provided in section 20-87 to said violator. At the option of the code enforcement board, notice may additionally be served by publication or posting as provided in section 20-87. If the violation is corrected and then recurs or if the violation is not corrected by the time specified for correction by the code inspector, the case may be presented to the enforcement board even if the violation has been corrected prior to the board hearing, and the notice shall so state. 
(c)  If a repeat violation is found, the code inspector shall notify the violator but is not required to give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation. The code inspector, upon notifying the violator of a repeat violation, shall notify the enforcement board and request a hearing. The code enforcement board, through its clerical staff, shall schedule a hearing and shall provide notice pursuant to section 20-87. The case may be presented to the enforcement board even if the repeat violation has been corrected prior to the board hearing, and the notice shall so state. If the repeat violation has been corrected, the code enforcement board retains the right to schedule a hearing to determine costs and impose the payment of reasonable enforcement fees upon the repeat violator. The repeat violator may choose to waive his rights to this hearing and pay said costs as determined by the code enforcement board. 
(d)  If the code inspector has reason to believe a violation or the condition causing the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the code inspector shall make a reasonable effort to notify the violator and may immediately notify the enforcement board and request a hearing. 
(e)  If the owner of property that is subject to an enforcement proceeding before an enforcement board, special magistrate, or court transfers ownership of such property between the time the initial pleading was served and the time of the hearing, such owner shall: 
(1)  Disclose, in writing, the existence and nature of the proceeding to the prospective transferee. 
(2)  Deliver to the prospective transferee a copy of the pleadings, notices, and other materials relating to the code enforcement proceeding received by the transferor. 
(3)  Disclose, in writing, to the prospective transferee that the new owner will be responsible for compliance with the applicable code and with orders issued in the code enforcement proceeding. 
(4)  File a notice with the code enforcement official of the transfer of the property, with the identity and address of the new owner and copies of the disclosures made to the new owner, within five days after the date of the transfer. 
A failure to make the disclosures described in subsections (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section before the transfer creates a rebuttable presumption of fraud. If the property is transferred before the hearing, the proceeding shall not be dismissed, but the new owner shall be provided a reasonable period of time to correct the violation before the hearing is held.

Minutes shall be kept of all hearings by the enforcement board, and all hearings and proceedings shall be open to the public. The city council shall provide clerical and administrative personnel as may be reasonably required by the enforcement board for the proper performance of its duties. 
(b)  Presented by city attorney; recovery of costs. Each case before the enforcement board shall be presented by the city attorney. If the city council prevails in prosecuting a case before the enforcement board, it shall be entitled to recover all costs incurred in prosecuting the case before the board, and such costs may be included in the lien authorized under section 20-84(e). 
(c)  Evidence presented. The enforcement board shall proceed to hear the cases on the agenda for that day. All testimony shall be under oath and shall be recorded. The enforcement board shall take testimony from the code inspector and alleged violator. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental due process shall be observed and shall govern the proceedings. 
(d)  Findings of fact; orders. At the conclusion of the hearing, the enforcement board shall issue findings of fact, based on the evidence of record and conclusions of law, and shall issue an order affording the proper relief consistent with powers granted in this article. The finding shall be by motion approved by a majority of those members present and voting, except that at least four members of a seven-member enforcement board must vote in order for the action to be official. The order may include a notice that it must be complied with by a specified date and that a fine may be imposed and, under the conditions specified in section 20-84(a), the cost of repairs may be included along with the fine if the order is not complied with by such date. A certified copy of such order may be recorded in the public records of the county and shall constitute notice to any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns if the violation concerns real property, and the findings therein shall be binding upon the violator and, if the violation concerns real property, any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns. If an order is recorded in the public records pursuant to this subsection and the order is complied with by the date specified in the order, the enforcement board shall issue an order acknowledging compliance that shall be recorded in the public records.

Sec. 20-83. - Enforcement board's powers. 
    The enforcement board shall have the power to:

Sec. 20-84. - Administrative fines; costs of repair; liens. 
(a)  The enforcement board, upon notification by the code inspector that an order of the enforcement board has not been complied with by the set time or upon the finding that a repeat violation has been committed, may order the violator to pay a fine in an amount specified in this section for each day the violation continues past the date set by the enforcement board for compliance or, in the case of a repeat violation, for each day the repeat violation continues, beginning with the date the repeat violation is found to have occurred by the code inspector. In addition, if the violation is a violation described in section 20-81(d), the enforcement board shall notify the city council, which may make all reasonable repairs which are required to bring the property into compliance and charge the violator with the reasonable cost of the repairs along with the fine imposed pursuant to this section. Making such repairs does not create a continuing obligation on the part of the city council to make further repairs or to maintain the property and does not create any liability against the city council for any damages to the property if such repairs were completed in good faith. If a finding of a violation or a repeat violation has been made as provided in this article, a hearing shall not be necessary for issuance of the order imposing the fine. If, after due notice and hearing, the code enforcement board finds a violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may order the violator to pay a fine as specified in subsection (b) of this section. 
(b)  A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall not exceed $250.00 per day for a first violation and shall not exceed $500.00 per day for a repeat violation and, in addition, may include all costs of repairs pursuant to section 20-84(a). However, if the code enforcement board finds the violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may impose a fine not to exceed $5,000.00 per violation. 
(c)  In determining the amount of the fine, if any, the enforcement board shall consider the following factors: 
(1)  The gravity of the violation; 
(2)  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; and 
(3)  Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
(d)  The enforcement board may reduce a fine imposed pursuant to this section. 
(e)  A certified copy of an order imposing a fine, or a fine plus repair costs, may be recorded in the public records and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order shall be enforceable in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriff of this state, including execution and levy against the personal property of the violator, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment, except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered in a suit filed pursuant to this section, whichever occurs first. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this section runs in favor of the city council, and the city council may execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered pursuant to this section. After three months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the enforcement board may authorize the city attorney to foreclose on the lien or to sue to recover a money judgment for the amount of the lien, plus accrued interest. No lien created pursuant to the provisions of this article may be foreclosed on real property which is a homestead under section 4, article X of the Florida Constitution. The money judgment provisions of this section shall not apply to real property or personal property which is covered under section 4(a), article X of the Florida Constitution.

Sec. 20-85. - Duration of lien. 
    No lien entered pursuant to this article shall continue for a period longer than 20 years after the certified copy of an order imposing a fine has been recorded, unless within that time an action is commenced pursuant to section 20-84(e) in a court of competent jurisdiction. In an action to foreclose on a lien or for a money judgment, the prevailing party is entitled to recover all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee, that it incurs in the action. The city council shall be entitled to collect all costs incurred in recording and satisfying a valid lien. The continuation of the lien effected by the commencement of the action shall not be good against creditors or subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, unless a notice of lis pendens is recorded.

Sec. 20-86. - Appeal. 
    An aggrieved party, including the city, may appeal a final administrative order of the enforcement board to the circuit court. Such an appeal shall not be a hearing de novo, but shall be limited to the appellate review of the record created before the enforcement board. An appeal shall be filed within 30 days of the execution of the order to be appealed.

(b)  Publication; posting. In addition to providing notice as set forth in subsection (a) of this section, at the option of the code enforcement board, notice may also be served by publication or posting, as follows: 
(1)  Such notice shall be published once during each week for four consecutive weeks (four publications being sufficient) in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the code enforcement board is located. The newspaper shall meet such requirements as are prescribed under F.S. ch. 50 for legal and official advertisements. Proof of publication shall be made as provided in F.S. §§ 50.041 and 50.051. 
(2)  In lieu of publication as described in subsection (b)(1) of this section, such notice may be posted at least ten days prior to the hearing, or prior to the expiration of any deadline contained in the notice, in at least two locations, one of which shall be the property upon which the violation is alleged to exist and the other of which shall be at the city hall. Proof of posting shall be by affidavit of the person posting the notice, which affidavit shall include a copy of the notice posted and the date and places of its posting. 
(3)  Notice by publication or posting may run concurrently with, or may follow, an attempt to provide notice by hand delivery or by mail as required under subsection (a) of this section. 
(c)  Evidence that an attempt has been made to hand deliver or mail the notice as provided in subsection (a) of this section, together with proof of the publication or posting as provided in subsection (b) of this section, shall be sufficient to show that the notice requirements of this article have been met, without regard to whether or not the alleged violator actually received such notice.

    Violators means those persons or entities legally responsible for the violation of the ordinances listed in section 20-233. 
(b)  Authority to initiate proceedings. Code enforcement officers shall have the authority to initiate enforcement proceedings as provided below. No special magistrate shall have the power to initiate such proceedings. 
(c)  Remedial period required. A code enforcement officer who finds a violation of the ordinances of this Code listed in section 20-233 shall determine a reasonable time period within which the violator must correct the violation. This determination shall be based on considerations of fairness; practicality; ease of correction; ability to correct; severity of violation; nature, extent and probability of danger or damage to the public; and other relevant factors relating to the reasonableness of the time period presented. A time for correction need not be specified if the violation is deemed to be an uncorrectable violation. 
(d)  Notice; service. A code enforcement officer who finds such a violation shall issue a civil violation notice to the violator. Service shall be effected by delivering the civil violation notice to the violator or his agent, or by leaving the civil violation notice at the violator's usual place of abode with any person residing therein who is 15 years of age or older and informing that person of its contents. If such service cannot be effected, the civil violation notice may be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by posting of the civil violation notice in a conspicuous place on the premises or real property upon which the violation has been observed. Such posting of the civil violation shall be deemed proper service, and the time for compliance, stated in the notice shall commence with the date such notice is posted.

(11)  Notice that the failure to request an administrative hearing within ten days, or within the specified time period listed for a violation of a specific section of the Code, after service of the civil violation notice, shall constitute a waiver of the violators right to an administrative hearing before the special magistrate, and that such waiver shall constitute an admission of violation; and

Sec. 20-226. - Civil penalties and related terms construed. 
(a)  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Continuing violations means those violations which remain uncorrected beyond the reasonable time period for correction contained in either the civil violation notice or the final order of the special magistrate, whichever is applicable. For each day of continued violation after the time for correction has run, an additional penalty in the same amount as that prescribed for the original violation shall be added. The maximum total fine for any one continuing violation shall not exceed ten times the original penalty amount. 
    Repeat violation means a recurring violation of an ordinance by a violator who has previously been guilty of the same violation. In the case of correctable violations, a repeat violation can occur only after correction of the previous violation has been made. For the first repeat violation, the amount of the civil penalty shall be double the amount of the penalty prescribed for the original violation by section 20-233. The amount of civil penalty due for each subsequent repeat violation shall be double the amount of the penalty due for the first day of the immediately preceding violation; provided that the maximum penalty payable for the first day of any one repeat violation shall be $500.00. 
    Uncorrectable violation means a violation which cannot be remedied after the violation has been committed because the violation constitutes a single prohibited act rather than an ongoing condition or circumstance. Each reoccurrence of an uncorrectable violation shall constitute a separate violation and shall subject the violator to an additional penalty in the same amount as that prescribed for the original violation. If, however, a violator has been once found guilty of an uncorrectable violation, and causes the same uncorrectable violation to occur a second time, each reoccurrence of the uncorrectable violation by such violator shall constitute a repeat violation as provided in subsection (c) of this section. 
(b)  Penalties for violations of the ordinances to be enforced by this article shall be in the amount prescribed in the schedule of civil penalties in section 20-233. 
(c)  A repeat violation which remains uncorrected beyond the time prescribed for correction in the civil violation notice shall be treated as a continuing violation, and the additional penalty for each day of continued violation shall be equal to the doubled amount due for the first day of the repeat violation. 
(d)  Continuing violation penalties shall accrue from the date of correction given in the civil violation notice until the correction is made if a request for an administrative hearing is not timely filed. If the named violator requests an administrative hearing on a correctable violation and loses his appeal, the special magistrate shall determine a reasonable time period within which correction of the violation must be made, based on the considerations set forth in section 20-194(c). If the correction is not made within the period set by the special magistrate, the continuing violation penalties shall begin after the time for correction has run. No continuing violation penalties shall accrue during the time period from the date of the civil violation notice until the date of the administrative hearing, if the named violator timely requests an administrative hearing to appeal the decision of the code enforcement officer. Continuing violation penalties cannot be imposed by the special magistrate for uncorrectable violations. 
(e)  Civil penalties assessed pursuant to this article are due and payable to the city clerk on the last day of the period allowed for the filing of an appeal from the special magistrate's decision, or, if a proper appeal is made, when the appeal has been finally decided adversely to the named violator. 
(Ord. No. 1151-04, § 3(3-1), 6-8-2004) 
Sec. 20-227. - Violator's rights; appeal; failure to comply. 
(a)  Violator's options. A violator who has been served with a civil violation notice shall elect either to: 
(1)  Pay the civil penalty in the manner indicated on the notice, and correct the violation within the time specified on the notice, if applicable; or 
(2)  Request an administrative hearing before a special magistrate to appeal the decision of the code enforcement officer which resulted in the issuance of the civil violation notice. 
(b)  Appeal. Appeal by administrative hearing of the notice of violation before a special magistrate shall be accomplished by filing a request in writing to the address indicated on the notice, within the time limit stipulated in the specified Code section which is enforced pursuant to the provisions of this article, or no later than ten calendar days after the service of the notice, whichever is earlier. 
(c)  Failure to comply. If the named violator, after notice, fails to pay the civil penalty and correct the violation within the time specified, if applicable, or fails to timely request an administrative hearing before a special magistrate, the special magistrate shall be informed of such failure by report from the code enforcement officer. If the named violator pays the civil penalty for a correctable violation, but does not correct that violation within the time specified, each day that the violation continues beyond such specified time shall constitute a continuing violation. The failure of the named violator to appeal the decision of the code enforcement officer within the prescribed time period shall constitute a waiver of the violator's right to an administrative hearing before the special magistrate. A waiver of the right to an administrative hearing shall be treated as an admission of the violation and penalties may be assessed accordingly. 
(Ord. No. 1151-04, § 3(3-2), 6-8-2004) 
Sec. 20-228. - Hearing procedure. 
(a)  Request for hearing. Upon the receipt of a named violator's timely request for an administrative hearing, the special magistrate shall set the matter down for hearing on the next regularly scheduled hearing date or as soon thereafter as possible or as mandated in the specified Code section which is enforced pursuant to this article. 
(b)  Notice; contents. The special magistrate shall send a notice of hearing by first class mail to the named violator at his last known address. The notice of hearing shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 
(1)  Name of the code enforcement officer who issued the notice; 
(2)  Factual description of the alleged violation; 
(3)  Date of the alleged violation; 
(4)  Section of the Code allegedly violated; 
(5)  Place, date, and time of the hearing; 
(6)  Right of the violator to be represented by a lawyer; 
(7)  Right of the violator to present witnesses and evidence; 
(8)  Notice that failure of the violator to attend the hearing may result in a civil penalty being assessed against him; and 
(9)  Notice that requests for continuances will not be considered if not received by the special magistrate at least ten calendar days prior to the date set for the hearing. 
(c)  Scheduling hearing. The special magistrates shall call hearings on a monthly basis or upon the request of the code enforcement officer. No hearing shall be set sooner than 20 calendar days from the date of the service of the notice of violation. 
(d)  Continuance. A hearing date shall not be postponed or continued unless a request for continuance, showing good cause for such continuance is received in writing by the special magistrate at least ten calendar days prior to the date set for the hearing. 
(e)  Open to public. All hearings of the special magistrate shall be open to the public. All testimony shall be under oath. Assuming proper notice, a hearing may proceed in the absence of the named violator. 
(f)  Transcription. The proceedings at the hearing shall be recorded and may be transcribed at the expense of the party requesting the transcript. 
(g)  Administrative support. The city planning department shall provide clerical and administrative personnel as may be reasonably required by each special magistrate for the proper performance of his duties. 
(h)  City attorney or his designee to present case. Each case before a special magistrate shall be presented by the city attorney or the city attorney's designee. 
(i)  No formal rules of evidence. The hearing need not be conducted in accordance with the formal rules relating to evidence and witnesses. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if the special magistrate finds it competent and reliable, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule to the contrary. 
(j)  Rights of parties. Each party shall have the right to: 
(1)  Call and examine witnesses; 
(2)  Introduce exhibits; 
(3)  Cross examine opposing witnesses on any matter relevant to the issues even though that matter was not covered on direct examination; 
(4)  Impeach any witness regardless of which party first called him to testify; and 
(5)  Rebut the evidence against him. 
(k)  Findings of facts; preponderance of the evidence standard. The special magistrate shall make findings of fact based on the evidence of record. In order to make a finding upholding the code enforcement officer's decision, the special magistrate must find that a preponderance of the evidence indicates that the named violator was responsible for the violation of the relevant section of the Code as charged. 
(l)  Costs; violator's responsibility if found guilty. If the named violator is found guilty of the violation, he may be held liable for the reasonable costs of the administrative hearing, at the discretion of the special magistrate. 
(m)  Special magistrate's discretion; contents of decision. The fact-finding determination of the special magistrate shall be limited to whether the violation alleged did occur and, if so, whether the person named in the civil violation notice can be held responsible for that violation. Based upon this fact-finding determination, the special magistrate shall either affirm or reverse the decision of the code enforcement officer as to the responsibility of the named violator for the Code violation. If the special magistrate affirms the decision of the code enforcement officer, the special magistrate, pursuant to section 20-194(c), shall determine a reasonable time period within which correction of the violation must be made. If the special magistrate reverses the decision of the code enforcement officer and finds the named violator not responsible for the Code violation alleged in the civil violation notice, the named violator shall not be liable for the payment of any civil penalty, absent reversal of the special magistrate's findings pursuant to section 20-230. If the special magistrate decides to affirm the code enforcement officer's ruling he shall include the following elements in his written decision: 
(1)  Amount of the civil penalty; 
(2)  Administrative costs of the hearing; 
(3)  Date by which the violation must be corrected to prevent imposition of continuing violation penalties (if applicable); 
(n)  Special magistrate's authority. The special magistrate shall have the power to: 
(1)  Adopt procedures for the conduct of hearings; 
(2)  Subpoena alleged violators and witnesses for hearings; subpoenas may be served by law enforcement officers or by the staff of the special magistrate; 
(3)  Subpoena evidence; 
(4)  Take testimony under oath; 
(5)  Assess and order the payment of civil penalties as provided herein; 
(6)  A special magistrate shall not postpone and shall conduct a hearing if the named violator, prior to the scheduled hearing date, files with the city board of adjustments an administrative appeal concerning the interpretation or application of any technical provisions of the Code section allegedly violated. However, once an issue has been determined by a special magistrate in a specific case, that issue may not be further reviewed by a city board in that specific case. A named violator waives his right to an administrative appeal to other city boards if the violator does not apply for such an appeal prior to the violator's code enforcement hearing before the special magistrate; 
(7)  Upon the exhaustion of a timely filed administrative appeal and finalization of the administrative order by such board, the special magistrate may exercise all the powers given to him by this article. The special magistrate shall not, however, exercise any jurisdiction over such alleged Code violations until the time allowed for the court appeal of the ruling has lapsed or until such further appeal has been exhausted; 
(8)  The special magistrate shall be bound by the interpretations and decisions of duly authorized city boards concerning the provisions of the codes within their respective city jurisdictions. In the event such a board decides that an alleged violation of the Code is not in accordance with such board's interpretation of the Code provision on which the violation is based, the special magistrate shall not be empowered to proceed with the enforcement of the violation.

(a)  The city may institute proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to compel payment of civil penalties. 
(b)  A certified copy of an order imposing a civil penalty may be recorded in the public records and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists or, if the violator does not own the land, upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator, and it may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including levy against the personal property, but shall not be deemed to be a court judgment, except for enforcement purposes. After one year from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the city may foreclose or otherwise execute on the lien. 
(Ord. No. 1151-04, § 3(3-4), 6-8-2004)

(b)  Unless the findings of the special magistrate are overturned in a proceeding held pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, all findings of the special magistrate shall be admissible in any proceeding to collect the unpaid penalties.

Sec. 20-231. - Provisions contained herein are supplemental.

(a)  A communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the city shall first register with the city in accordance with this article. Subject to the terms and conditions prescribed in this article, a registrant may place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way. 
(b)  A registration shall not convey any title, equitable or legal, to the registrant in the public rights-of-way. Registration under this article governs only the placement or maintenance of the communications facilities in the public rights-of-way. Other ordinances, codes or regulations may apply to the placement or maintenance in the public rights-of-way of facilities that are not communications facilities. Registration does not excuse a communications services provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before locating its facilities on the city's or another person's facilities. Registration does not excuse a communications services provider from complying with all applicable city ordinances, codes or regulations, including this article. 
(c)  Each communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in the city's public rights-of-way shall file a single registration with the city, which shall include the following information:

(6)  For an applicant that does not provide a state public service commission certificate of authorization number, if the applicant is a corporation, proof of authority to do business in the state, such as the number of the certificate from or filing with the department of state. 
(d)  No registration application fee will be charged by the city. 
(e)  The city shall review the information submitted by the applicant. Such review shall be by the public works director. If the applicant submits information in accordance with subsection (c) of this section, the registration shall be effective and the city shall notify the applicant of the effectiveness of the registration in writing. If the city determines that the information has not been submitted in accordance with subsection (c) of this section, the city shall notify the applicant of the noneffectiveness of the registration and reasons for the noneffectiveness, in writing. The city shall so reply to an applicant within 30 days after receipt of the registration information from the applicant. Noneffectiveness of the registration shall not preclude an applicant from filing subsequent applications for registration under the provisions of this section. An applicant has 30 days after receipt of a notice of noneffectiveness of registration to appeal the decision as provided in section 22-37. 
(f)  A registrant may cancel a registration upon written notice to the city stating that it will no longer place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way within the city and will no longer need to obtain permits to perform work in public rights-of-way. A registrant cannot cancel a registration if the registrant continues to place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way. 
(g)  A registration does not in and of itself establish a right to place or maintain or priority for the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way within the city but shall establish for the registrant a right to apply for a permit, if permitting is required by the city. Registrations are expressly subject to any future amendment to or replacement of this article and further subject to any additional city ordinances, as well as any state or federal laws that may be enacted. 
(h)  A registrant shall renew its registration with the city by April 1 of even-numbered years in accordance with the registration requirements in this article, except that a registrant that initially registers during the even-numbered year when renewal would be due or the odd-numbered year immediately preceding such even-numbered year shall not be required to renew until the next even-numbered year. Within 30 days of any change in the information required to be submitted pursuant to subsection (c) of this section except, as of October 1, 2001, subsection (c)(3) of this section, a registrant shall provide updated information to the city. If no information in the then-existing registration has changed, the renewal may state that no information has changed. The failure to renew a registration may result in the city restricting the issuance of additional permits until the communications services provider has complied with the registration requirements of this article. 
(i)  In accordance with applicable city ordinances, codes or regulations, a permit may be required of a communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way. An effective registration shall be a condition of obtaining a permit. Notwithstanding an effective registration, permitting requirements shall apply.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 29-1. - Title. 
    These regulations shall be known as the floodplain management ordinance of the City of Milton hereinafter referred to as "this chapter." 
(Ord. No. 1371-12, § 2(101.1), 8-15-2012; Ord. No. 1424-15 , § II, 9-8-2015) 
Sec. 29-2. - Scope. 
    The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including but not limited to the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development. 
(Ord. No. 1371-12, § 2(101.2), 8-15-2012; Ord. No. 1424-15 , § II, 9-8-2015) 
Sec. 29-3. - Intent. 
    The purposes of this chapter and the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
(1)  Minimize unnecessary disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
(2)  Require the use of appropriate construction practices in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
(3)  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
(4)  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas; 
(7)  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; and 
(8)  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in 44 CFR 59.22.

Sec. 29-5. - Warning. 
    The degree of flood protection required by this chapter and the Florida Building Code, as amended by this community, is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the flood insurance study and shown on flood insurance rate maps and the requirements of 44 CFR 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring this community to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with this chapter.

This requirement applies to the structures in velocity zones (V-zones). 
    Freeboard means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management "freeboard" tends to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed. 
    Functionally dependent facility means a facility which cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water, such as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding, ship repair, or seafood processing facilities. The term does not include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities. 
    Hardship (as related to variances of this article) means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The (governing body) requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is NOT exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.

    Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a structure, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure either before the improvement or repair is started, or if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. The market value of the structure should be: 
 The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; 
 In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. 
    For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvements" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alternation affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, or any alterations of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or state master site file inventory of historic sites. 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equal or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.

( Ord. No. 1459-17 , § 1, 9-12-2017) 
Sec. 29-376. - Provisions for flood hazard reduction. 
(a)  General standards. In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
(1)  New construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure. 
(2)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces. 
(3)  New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
(4)  New construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
(5)  Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
(6)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters. 
(7)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters. 
(8)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(9)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a structure which is in compliance with the provisions of this section, shall meet the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this section. 
(10)  Structural storage facilities for chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, flammable liquids, or other hazardous or toxic materials shall be located outside of floodprone areas to the extent possible and feasible. In the event that the site of these facilities must be in floodprone or floodplain areas due to overriding circumstances (see variance conditions and standards), the design and construction of the facilities shall be floodproofed in accordance with the following standard: A registered professional engineer must certify that the building or structure has been designed and constructed so that the structure and attendant facilities are watertight and capable of resisting the effects of the regulatory flood below the flood protection elevation established in this section. The design must take into account flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic forces, the effect of buoyancy, and impacts from debris. 
(11)  Limit the alteration of a natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protection barriers which are involved in the accommodation or incompatible filling, grading, dredging, drainage, and other development which will result in a damaging increase in erosion, habitat destruction, or adverse impacts on the water quality treatment function of the floodplain. 
(12)  In cases where forestry activities are present, a minimum distance of 50 feet of wooded non-disturbed area shall be maintained adjacent to floodplain and floodprone areas for a natural buffer. 
(13)  Compatible uses are highly encouraged in floodplain and floodprone areas including, but not limited to, recreational, agricultural, or other open space use. 
(b)  Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data have been provided, as set forth in section 29-374 or section 29-375(c)(11). The following provisions are required: 
(1)  Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than three feet above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of section 29-375(b). Additionally, V-zone requirement shall be imposed on all lands within 200 feet from the mean high tide line. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or nonresidential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation. Structures located in all A zones may be floodproofed in lieu of being elevated provided that all areas of the structure below the required elevation are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in section 29-375(b)(3). 
(3)  Elevated buildings. New construction or substantial improvements of elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls. 
a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions. 
b.  Electrical, plumbing, and other utility connections are prohibited below the base flood elevation; 
c.  Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and 
d.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
(4)  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 29-374(b), are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and has erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  Prohibit encroachment, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
b.  If subsection (b)(4)a. is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of section 29-376. 
c.  Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes), except in an existing manufactured home (mobile homes) parks or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of (a)(2) and the elevation standards of (b)(1) are met. 
(5)  Coastal high hazard areas (V zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 29-374(b), are areas designated as coastal high hazard areas. These areas have special flood hazards associated with wave wash; therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  All buildings or structures shall be located 100 feet landward of the reach of the mean high tide; 
b.  All buildings or structures shall be elevated so that the bottom of the lowest supporting horizontal member (excluding pilings or columns) is located no lower than two feet above the base flood elevation level, with all space below the lowest supporting member open so as not to impede the flow of water. Open lattice work or decorative screening may be permitted for aesthetic purposes only and must be designed to wash away in the event of abnormal wave action and in accordance with subsection (b)(5)h.; 
c.  All buildings or structures shall be securely anchored on pilings or columns; 
d.  All pilings and columns and the attached structures shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the effect of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building components. The anchoring and support system shall be designed with wind and water loading values which equal or exceed the 100-year mean recurrence interval (one-percent annual chance flood). 
e.  A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design, specifications and plans for construction are in compliance with provisions contained in subsection (b)(5)b., c. and d. of this section. 
f.  There shall be no fill used as structural support. Non-compacted fill may be used around the perimeter of a building for landscaping/aesthetic purposes provided the fill will wash out from the storm surge, (thereby rendering the building free of obstruction) prior to generating excessive loading forces, ramping effects, or wave deflection. The building official shall approve design plans for landscaping/aesthetic fill only after the applicant has provided an analysis by an engineer, architect, and/or soil scientist, which demonstrates that the following factors have been fully considered: 
1.  Particle composition of fill material does not have a tendency for excessive natural compaction; 
2.  Volume and distribution of fill will not cause wave deflection to adjacent properties; and 
3.  Slope of fill will not cause wave run-up or ramping. 
g.  There shall be no alteration of sand dunes or mangrove stands which would increase potential flood damage. 
h.  Lattice work or decorative screening shall be allowed below the base flood elevation provided they are not part of the structural support of the building and are designed so as to breakaway, under abnormally high tides or wave action, without damage to the structural integrity of the building on which they are to be used provided the following design specifications are met: 
1.  No solid walls shall be allowed; and 
2.  Material shall consist of lattice or mesh screening only. 
i.  If aesthetic lattice work or screening is utilized, such enclosed space shall not be designed to be used for human habitation, but shall be designed to be used only for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises; 
j.  Prior to construction, plans for any structures that will have lattice work or decorative screening must be submitted to the building official for approval; 
k.  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure shall not enclose the space below the lowest floor except with lattice work or decorative screening, as provided for in subsections (b)(5)h. and i; 
l.  Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes) except in an existing manufactured homes (mobile homes) park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of subsection (a)(2) and the elevation standards of subsection (b)(1) are met. 
(6)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. 
a.  All manufactured homes that are placed, or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE, on sites (i) outside of an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, the lowest floor be elevated on a permanent foundation to (no lower than three feet above) the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
b.  All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones A-1, AH, and AE, that are not subject to the provisions of paragraph (4)a. of this section, must be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation, or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength that are no less than 72 inches in height above the grade and securely anchored to an adequate foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
c.  All recreational vehicles placed on sits within zones A1-30, AH, and AE must either: 
1.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
2.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions); or 
3.  Meet all the requirements for new construction, including anchoring and elevation requirements in accordance with subsection (b)(4)a. and b. of this section. 
(c)  Standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodways. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 29-374(b), where small streams exist but where no base flood data has been provided or where no floodways have been provided, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  No encroachment, including fill material or structures shall be located within a distance of the stream bank equal to two times the width of the stream at the top of bank or 20 feet each side from top of bank, whichever is greater, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  New construction or substantial improvements of structures shall be elevated or floodproofed to elevations established in accordance with section 29-375(c)(11). 
(d)  Standards for subdivision proposals: 
(1)  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
(2)  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
(3)  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards, and; 
(4)  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions). 
(e)  Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 29-374(b) are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have special flood hazards associated with the base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including the basement, elevated to the depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map, in feet, above the highest adjacent (natural) grade. 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall: 
a.  Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the depth number specified on the flood insurance rate map, in feet, above the highest adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade, or; 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be completely floodproofed to or above that level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. 
(f)  Specific standards: 
(1)  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 29-374, where there exist A zones for which no base flood elevation data and regulatory floodway have been provided or designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  All applicable provisions of this section. 
b.  The floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, State of Florida, or any other source, in order to administer the provisions of this article. When such data is utilized, provisions of section 29-376 shall apply. The floodplain administrator shall: 
1.  Obtain the elevation (in relation to the mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including the basement) of all new and substantially improved structures; 
2.  Obtain, if the structure has been floodproofed in accordance with the requirements of this section, the elevation in relation to the mean sea level to which the structure has been floodproofed, and maintain a record of all such information. 
c.  When data is not available from any source, the lowest floor of the structure shall be elevated to no lower than three feet above the highest adjacent level.

b.  The housing facility or community publishes and adheres to policies and procedures that demonstrate the intent required under this subsection. If the housing facility or community meets the requirements of subsections (a)(3)a. and (a)(3)c. of this section and the recorded governing documents provide for an adult, senior, or retirement housing facility or community and the governing documents lack an amendatory procedure, prohibit amendments, or restrict amendments until a specified future date, that housing facility or community shall be deemed housing for older persons intended and operated for occupancy by persons 55 years of age or older. If those documents further provide a prohibition against residents 16 years of age or younger, that provision shall be construed, for purposes of the Fair Housing Act, to only apply to residents 18 years of age or younger, in order to conform with federal law requirements. Governing documents which can be amended at a future date must be amended and properly recorded within one year after that date to reflect the requirements for consideration as housing for older persons, if that housing facility or community intends to continue as housing for older persons. 
c.  The housing facility or community complies with the rules made by the Secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development pursuant to 24 CFR 100 for verification of occupancy, which rules provide for verification by reliable surveys and affidavits and include examples of the types of policies and procedures relevant to a determination of compliance with the requirements of subsection (a)(3)b. of this section. Such surveys and affidavits are admissible in administrative and judicial proceedings for the purposes of such verification. 
(b)  Any provision of this division regarding familial status does not apply with respect to housing for older persons. 
(c)  Housing shall not fail to be considered housing for older persons if: 
(1)  A person who resides in such housing on or after October 1, 1989, does not meet the age requirements of this section; provided that any new occupant meets such age requirements; or 
(2)  One or more units is unoccupied; provided that any unoccupied units are reserved for occupancy by persons who meet the age requirements of this section. 
(d)  A person shall not be personally liable for monetary damages for a violation of this section if such person reasonably relied in good faith on the application of the exemption under this section relating to housing for older persons. For purposes of this subsection, a person may show good faith reliance on the application of the exemption only by showing that: 
(1)  The person has no actual knowledge that the facility or the community is ineligible, or will become ineligible, for such exemption; and 
(2)  The facility or community has stated formally, in writing, that the facility or community complies with the requirements for such exemption. 
(e)  A facility or community claiming an exemption under this section shall register with the city and submit a letter stating that the facility or community complies with the requirements of subsections (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section. The letter shall be submitted on the letterhead of the facility or community and shall be signed by the president of the facility or community. This registration and documentation shall be renewed biennially from the date of original filing. The information in the registry shall be made available to the public. The city may establish a reasonable registration fee, not to exceed $20.00, that shall be deposited into a trust fund to defray the administrative costs associated with maintaining the registry. The city may impose an administrative fine, not to exceed $500.00, on a facility or community that knowingly submits false information in the documentation required by this subsection. Such fines shall be deposited in the trust fund. The registration and documentation required by this subsection shall not substitute for proof of compliance with the requirements of this section. Failure to comply with the requirements of this subsection shall not disqualify a facility or community that otherwise qualifies for the exemption provided in this section.

Sec. 30-64. - Review procedure. 
(a)  Within 30 days after the filing of an informal complaint pursuant to section 30-63, the administrator shall make such investigations as he deems appropriate to ascertain facts and issues. If the administrator shall deem that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a violation has occurred and can be resolved by conciliation, he shall attempt to conciliate the matter by methods of initial conference and persuasion with all interested parties and such representatives as the parties may choose to assist them. Conciliation conferences shall be informal, and nothing said or done in the course of the informal conference with the individuals to resolve the dispute may be made public or used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding by either party without the written consent of both the complainant and the respondent. The administrator or any employee of the administrator who shall make public any information in violation of this subsection shall be deemed guilty of a violation and shall be subject to penalty as set forth in section 1-13. 
(b)  If the parties desire to conciliate, the terms of the conciliation shall be reduced in writing in the form approved by the administrator and must be signed and verified by the complainant and respondent and approved by the administrator. The conciliation agreement is for conciliation purposes only and does not constitute an admission by any party that the law has been violated.

(d)  If the administrator, with respect to any matter which involves a contravention of this division, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties in good faith have attempted such conciliation, or determines that the violation alleged in the complaint cannot be resolved by conciliation, he shall notify both the complainant and the respondent within 30 days of the failure or the determination, and he shall proceed as provided in section 30-62(c).

b.  The person repeatedly beckons to, stops, attempts to stop or engage in conversation with passersby, whether such passersby are on foot or in a motor vehicle, for the purpose of inducing, enticing, soliciting or procuring another to illegally possess, transfer, or buy any controlled substances; or 
c.  The person repeatedly passes to or receives from passersby, whether such passersby are on foot or in a motor vehicle, money, objects or written material for the purpose of inducing, enticing, soliciting or procuring another to illegally possess, transfer or buy any controlled substances.

(4)  No arrest shall be made for a violation of subsection (b)(2) of this section, unless the arresting officer first affords the person an opportunity to explain his conduct, and no one shall be convicted of violating subsection (b)(2) of this section if it appears at trial that the explanation given was true and disclosed a lawful purpose.

(Ord. No. 1409-14 , § 1, 6-11-2014) 
Sec. 32-52. - Definitions. 
    [The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:] 
    Boating-restricted area means an area of the waters of the state within which the operation of vessels is subject to specified restrictions or from which vessels are excluded. 
    Idle speed and idle speed no wake may be used interchangeably and mean that a vessel must proceed at a speed no greater than that which will maintain steerageway and headway. At no time is any vessel required to proceed so slowly that the operator is unable to maintain control over the vessel or any other vessel or object that it has under tow. 
    Motorboat means any vessel equipped with machinery for propulsion, irrespective of whether the propulsion machinery is in actual operation. 
    Operate means to be in charge of or in command of or in actual physical control of a vessel upon the waters of this state, or to exercise control over or to have responsibility for a vessel's navigation or safety while the vessel is underway upon the waters of this state, or to control or steer a vessel being towed or another vessel upon the waters of the state. 
    Person means an individual, partnership, firm, corporation, association or other entity. 
    Regulatory marker means a device used to alert the mariner to various regulatory matters such as horsepower, speed, wake, or entry restrictions in conformity with the Uniform State Waterway Marking System and the United States Aids to Navigation System, Part 62 of Title 33 of the Code of Federal Regulations. 
    Slow speed and slow speed minimum wake may be used interchangeably and mean that a vessel must be fully off plane and completely settled into the water. The vessel must then proceed at a speed which is reasonable and prudent under the prevailing circumstances so as to avoid the creation of an excessive wake or other hazardous condition which endangers or is likely to endanger other vessels or other persons using the waterway. At no time is any vessel required to proceed so slowly that the operator is unable to maintain control over the vessel or any other vessel or object that it has under tow. A vessel that is: 
(1)  Operating on plane is not proceeding at this speed; 
(2)  In the process of coming off plane and settling into the water or coming up onto plane is not proceeding at this speed; 
(3)  Operating at a speed that creates a wake which unreasonably or unnecessarily endangers other vessels or other persons using the waterway, or is likely to do so, is not proceeding at this speed; 
(4)  Completely off plane and which has fully settled into the water and is proceeding at a reasonable and prudent speed with little or no wake is proceeding at this speed. 
    Vessel is synonymous with boat as referenced in Section 1(b), Article VII of the State Constitution and includes every description of watercraft, barge, and airboat, other than a seaplane on the water, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water. 
    Wake means when used in conjunction with a numerical size limit, means all changes in the vertical height of the water's surface caused by the passage of a vessel including, but not limited to, a vessel's bow wave, stem wake, and propeller wash, measured from the ambient tide level to the crest of the vessel's wake at a distance of not less than 25 feet from the vessel. 
(Ord. No. 1409-14 , § 2, 6-11-2014) 
Sec. 32-53. - Area of enforcement. 
    The areas of enforcement shall be all waters, creeks and canals located within the boundaries described below for the purpose necessary to protect the safety of the public as such restrictions are necessary based on boating accidents, visibility, hazardous currents or water levels, vessel traffic congestion, or other navigational hazards in compliance with F.S. § 327.46. 
(1)  Area 1 (North) shall be defined as an idle speed no wake boating restricted area and will continue south from regulatory marker number two the full length of Quinn Bayou. Seven markers have been added to the existing idle speed no wake footprint to aid in vessel navigation. 
(2)  Area 2 (South) shall be defined as a slow speed no wake boating restricted area and will include the portions of the Blackwater River that intersect the following areas: A 500-foot radius around the Russell Harber Landing Boat Launch, a 500-foot radius from each end of the Riverwalk boardwalk, the "gap" which lies between the two previous boating restricted areas, and a 300-foot radius around the center of the CSX trestle bridge. Eight regulatory markers will be strategically placed along these boating restricted areas (see drawings) to alert the public of the regulations.

    Actuarial equivalent means a benefit or amount of equal value, based upon the RP-2000 Combined Healthy Unisex Mortality Table and an interest rate equal to the investment return assumption set forth in the last actuarial valuation report approved by the board. This definition may only be amended by the city pursuant to the recommendation of the board using assumptions adopted by the board with the advice of the plan's actuary, such that actuarial assumptions are not subject to city discretion. 
    Average final compensation means one-twelfth of the average salary of the five best years of the last ten years of credited service prior to retirement, termination, or death, or the career average as a full-time general employee, whichever is greater. A year shall be 12 consecutive months. 
    Beneficiary means the person or persons entitled to receive benefits hereunder at the death of a member who has or have been designated in writing by the member and filed with the board. If no such designation is in effect, or if no person so designated is living, at the time of death of the member, the beneficiary shall be the estate of the member. 
    Board means the board of trustees, which shall administer and manage the system herein provided and serve as trustees of the fund.

    Code means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. 
    Credited service means the total number of years and fractional parts of years as a general employee and member, with member contributions, when required, omitting intervening years or fractional parts of years when such member was not employed by the city as a general employee and the fractional parts of years prior to the general employee becoming a member of the system pursuant to section 38-112, and including any credited service previously credited to a member who participated in a prior retirement plan. A member may voluntarily leave his accumulated contributions in the fund for a period of five years after leaving the employ of the city pending the possibility of being reemployed as a general employee, without losing credit for the time that he was a member of the system. If a vested member leaves the employ of the city, his accumulated contributions will be returned only upon his written request. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed as a general employee with the city within five years, his accumulated contributions, if $1,000.00 or less, shall be returned. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed within five years, his accumulated contributions, if more than $1,000.00, will be returned only upon the written request of the member and upon completion of a written election to receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount on forms designated by the board. Upon return of a member's accumulated contributions, all of his rights and benefits under the system are forfeited and terminated.

(1)  The member is entitled to reemployment under the provisions of USERRA. 
(2)  The member returns to his employment as a general employee within one year following the earlier of the date of his military discharge or his release from service, unless otherwise required by USERRA. 
(3)  The member deposits into the fund the same sum that the member would have contributed, if any, if he had remained a general employee during his absence. The maximum credit for military service pursuant to this subdivision shall be five years. The member must deposit all missed contributions within a period equal to three times the period of military service, but not more than five years, following re-employment or he will forfeit the right to receive credited service for his military service pursuant to this subsection. 
(4)  This subsection is intended to satisfy the minimum requirements of USERRA. To the extent that this subsection does not meet the minimum standards of USERRA, as it may be amended from time to time, the minimum standards shall apply. 
    In the event a member dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing USERRA qualified military service, the beneficiaries of the member are entitled to any benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) as if the member had resumed employment and then died while employed. 
    Beginning January 1, 2009, to the extent required by section 414(u)(12) of the code, an individual receiving differential wage payments (as defined under section 3401(h)(2) of the code) from an employer shall be treated as employed by that employer, and the differential wage payment shall be treated as compensation for purposes of applying the limits on annual additions under section 415(c) of the code. This provision shall be applied to all similarly situated individuals in a reasonably equivalent manner.

    Member means actively employed full time general employee, including "contract" employees, who fulfill the prescribed membership requirements. Benefit improvements which, in the past, have been provided for by amendments to the system adopted by city ordinance, and any benefit improvements which might be made in the future shall apply prospectively and shall not apply to members who terminate employment or who retire prior to the effective date of any ordinance adopting such benefit improvements, unless such ordinance specifically provides to the contrary. 
    Plan year means the 12-month period beginning October 1 and ending September 30 of the following year. 
    Retiree means a member who has entered retirement status. 
    Retirement means a member's separation from city employment with eligibility for immediate receipt of benefits under the system. 
    Salary means the total compensation for services rendered to the city as a general employee reportable on the member's W-2 form, excluding bonuses and plus all tax deferred, tax sheltered or tax exempt items of income derived from elective employee payroll deductions or salary reductions otherwise includible. For service earned on or after July 1, 2011, salary shall not include more than 300 hours of overtime per fiscal year. Provided however, in any event, payments for overtime in excess of 300 hours per year accrued as of July 1, 2011 and attributable to service earned prior to the July 1, 2011, may still be included in salary for pension purposes even if the payment is not actually made until on or after July 1, 2011. In any event, with respect to unused sick leave and unused annual leave accrued prior to July 1, 2011, salary will include the lesser of the amount of sick or annual leave time accrued on July 1, 2011 or the actual amount of sick or annual leave time for which the retiree receives payment at the time of retirement, regardless of whether the amount of sick or annual leave was, at some time prior to retirement, reduced below the amount on July 1, 2011. 
    Compensation in excess of the limitations set forth in Section 401(a)(17) of the Code as of the first day of the plan year shall be disregarded for any purpose, including employee contributions or any benefit calculations. The annual compensation of each member taken into account in determining benefits or employee contributions for any plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, may not exceed $200,000.00, as adjusted for cost-of-living increases in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17)(B). Compensation means compensation during the fiscal year. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination period that begins with or within such calendar year. If the determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the annual compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period, and the denominator of which is 12. If the compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a member's contributions or benefits for the current plan year, the compensation for such prior determination period is subject to the applicable annual compensation limit in effect for that prior period. The limitation on compensation for an "eligible employee" shall not be less than the amount which was allowed to be taken into account hereunder as in effect on July 1, 1993. "Eligible employee" is an individual who was a member before the plan year beginning after December 31, 1995. 
    Spouse means the member's or retiree's spouse under applicable law at the time benefits become payable.

(1)  As part of the system, there is hereby established the fund, into which shall be deposited all of the contributions and assets whatsoever attributable to the system, including the assets of the prior general employees' retirement system. 
(2)  The actual custody and supervision of the fund (and assets thereof) shall be vested in the board. Payment of benefits and disbursements from the fund shall be made by the disbursing agent but only upon written authorization from the board. 
(3)  All funds of the general employees' retirement system may be deposited by the board with the treasurer of the city, acting in a ministerial capacity only, who shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as he is liable for the safekeeping of funds for the city. However, any funds so deposited with the treasurer of the city shall be kept in a separate fund by the treasurer or clearly identified as such funds of the general employees' retirement system. In lieu thereof, the board shall deposit the funds of the general employees' retirement system in a qualified public depository as defined in F.S. § 280.02, which depository with regard to such funds shall conform to and be bound by all of the provisions of F.S. Ch. 280. In order to fulfill its investment responsibilities as set forth herein, the board may retain the services of a custodian bank, an investment advisor registered under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 or otherwise exempt from such required registration, an insurance company, or a combination of these, for the purposes of investment decisions and management. Such investment manager shall have discretion, subject to any guidelines as prescribed by the board, in the investment of all fund assets. 
(4)  All funds and securities of the system may be commingled in the fund, provided that accurate records are maintained at all times reflecting the financial composition of the fund, including accurate current accounts and entries as regards the following: 
a.  Current amounts of accumulated contributions of members on both an individual and aggregate account basis, and 
b.  Receipts and disbursements, and 
c.  Benefit payments, and 
d.  Current amounts clearly reflecting all monies, funds and assets whatsoever attributable to contributions and deposits from the city, and 
e.  All interest, dividends and gains (or losses) whatsoever, and 
f.  Such other entries as may be properly required so as to reflect a clear and complete financial report of the fund. 
(5)  An audit shall be performed annually by a certified public accountant for the most recent fiscal year of the plan showing a detailed listing of assets and a statement of all income and disbursements during the year. Such income and disbursements must be reconciled with the assets at the beginning and end of the year. Such report shall reflect a complete evaluation of assets on both a cost and market basis, as well as other items normally included in a certified audit. 
(6)  The board shall have the following investment powers and authority: 
a.  The board shall be vested with full legal title to said fund, subject, however, and in any event to the authority and power of the Milton City Council to amend or terminate this fund, provided that no amendment or fund termination shall ever result in the use of any assets of this fund except for the payment of regular expenses and benefits under this system, except as otherwise provided herein. All contributions from time to time paid into the fund, and the income thereof, without distinction between principal and income, shall be held and administered by the board or its agent in the fund and the board shall not be required to segregate or invest separately any portion of the fund. 
b.  All monies paid into or held in the fund shall be invested and reinvested by the board and the investment of all or any part of such funds shall be subject to the following: 
1.  Notwithstanding any limitation in prior city ordinances to the contrary, all monies paid into or held in the fund may be invested and reinvested in such securities, investment vehicles or property wherever situated and of whatever kind, as shall be approved by the board, including but not limited to common or preferred stocks, bonds, and other evidences of indebtedness or ownership. 
2.  The board shall develop and adopt a written investment policy statement setting forth permissible types of investments, goals and objectives of investments and setting quality and quantity limitations on investments in accordance with the recommendations of its investment consultants. The investment policy statement shall be reviewed by the board at least annually. 
3.  In addition, the board may, upon recommendation by the board's investment consultant, make investments in group trusts meeting the requirements of Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 81-100, Revenue Ruling 2011-1, IRS Notice 2012-6 and Revenue Ruling 2014-24 or successor rulings or guidance of similar import, and operated or maintained exclusively for the commingling and collective investment of monies, provided that the funds in the group trust consist exclusively of trust assets held under plans qualified under section 401(a) of the code, individual retirement accounts that are exempt under section 408(e) of the code, eligible governmental plans that meet the requirements of section 457(b) of the code, and governmental plans under 401(a)(24) of the code. For this purpose, a trust includes a custodial account or separate tax favored account maintained by an insurance company that is treated as a trust under section 401(f) or under section 457(g)(3) of the code. While any portion of the assets of the fund are invested in such a group trust, such group trust is itself adopted as a part of the system or plan. 
1.  Any collective or common group trust to which assets of the fund are transferred pursuant to subsection c. shall be adopted by the board as part of the plan by executing appropriate participation, adoption agreements, and/or trust agreements with the group trust's trustee. 
2.  The separate account maintained by the group trust for the plan pursuant to subsection c. shall not be used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than for the exclusive benefit of the members and beneficiaries of the plan. 
3.  For purposes of valuation, the value of the separate account maintained by the group trust for the plan shall be the fair market value of the portion of the group trust held for the plan, determined in accordance with generally recognized valuation procedures. 
c.  At least once every three years, and more often as determined by the board, the board shall retain a professionally qualified independent consultant to evaluate the performance of all current investment managers and make recommendations regarding the retention of all such investment managers. These recommendations shall be considered by the board at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
d.  The board may retain in cash and keep unproductive of income such amount of the fund as it may deem advisable, having regard for the cash requirements of the system. 
e.  Neither the board nor any trustee shall be liable for the making, retention or sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of the fund, except that due to his or its own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. 
f.  The board may cause any investment in securities held by it to be registered in or transferred into its name as trustee or into the name of such nominee as it may direct, or it may retain them unregistered and in form permitting transferability, but the books and records shall at all times show that all investments are part of the fund. 
g.  The board is empowered, but is not required, to vote upon any stocks, bonds, or securities of any corporation, association, or trust and to give general or specific proxies or powers of attorney with or without power of substitution; to participate in mergers, reorganizations, recapitalizations, consolidations, and similar transactions with respect to such securities; to deposit such stock or other securities in any voting trust or any protective or like committee with the trustees or with depositories designated thereby; to amortize or fail to amortize any part or all of the premium or discount resulting from the acquisition or disposition of assets; and generally to exercise any of the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, or other investments comprising the fund which it may deem to be to the best interest of the fund to exercise. 
h.  The board shall not be required to make any inventory or appraisal or report to any court, nor to secure any order of court for the exercise of any power contained herein. 
Where any action which the board is required to take or any duty or function which it is required to perform either under the terms herein or under the general law applicable to it as trustee under this article, can reasonably be taken or performed only after receipt by it from a member, the city, or any other entity, of specific information, certification, direction or instructions, the board shall be free of liability in failing to take such action or perform such duty or function until such information, certification, direction or instruction has been received by it. 
i.  Any overpayments or underpayments from the fund to a member, retiree or beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate per annum approved by the board in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member, retiree or beneficiary was correctly entitled, shall be paid. Overpayments shall be charged against payments next succeeding the correction or collected in another manner if prudent. Underpayments shall be made up from the fund in a prudent manner. 
j.  The board shall sustain no liability whatsoever for the sufficiency of the fund to meet the payments and benefits provided for herein. 
k.  In any application to or proceeding or action in the courts, only the board shall be a necessary party, and no member or other person having an interest in the fund shall be entitled to any notice or service of process. Any judgment entered in such a proceeding or action shall be conclusive upon all persons. 
l.  Any of the foregoing powers and functions reposed in the board may be performed or carried out by the board through duly authorized agents, provided that the board at all times maintains continuous supervision over the acts of any such agent; provided further, that legal title to said fund shall always remain in the board.

(c)  Other. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the fund, but such deposits must be accounted for separately and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis. Funds arising from these sources may be used only for additional benefits for members, as determined by the board, and may not be used to reduce what would have otherwise been required city contributions.

(2)  An immediate monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on his early retirement date and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The benefit payable shall be as determined in subsection (a) above, and actuarially reduced for each year by which the commencement of benefits precedes the date which would have been the member's normal retirement date based on actual years of credited service as a general employee.

(Ord. No. 1332-10, § 1(7), 9-14-2010) 
Sec. 38-118. - Disability. 
(a)  Disability benefits. Any member who has completed ten or more years of credited service and who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service to the city, and whose claim is not based on a disqualifying condition under subsection (b), shall, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to two and one-half percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service. Terminated persons, either vested or nonvested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the city for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within 30 days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(b)  Conditions disqualifying disability benefits. Each member who is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
(1)  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or narcotics. 
(2)  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections. 
(3)  Injury or disease sustained while committing a crime. 
(4)  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the armed forces. 
(5)  Injury or disease sustained after his employment as a general employee with the City of Milton shall have terminated. 
(6)  Willful, wanton or intentional misconduct or gross negligence of the member. 
(7)  Injury or disease sustained by the member while working for anyone other than the city and arising out of such employment. 
(8)  A condition pre-existing the general employee's membership in the system. No member shall be entitled to a disability pension, whether in line of duty or not in line of duty, because of or due to the aggravation of a specific injury, impairment or other medical condition pre-existing at the time of membership in the system, provided that such pre-existing condition and its relationship to a later injury, impairment or other medical condition be established by competent substantial evidence. Nothing herein shall be construed to preclude a disability pension to a member who, after membership in the system, suffers an injury, impairment or other medical condition different from some other injury, impairment, or other medical condition existing at or prior to said membership. 
(c)  Physical examination requirement. A member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons, who shall be selected by the board for that purpose. The board shall not select the member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose except in an unusual case where the board determines that it would be reasonable and prudent to do so. 
    Any retiree receiving disability benefits under provisions of this article maybe periodically re-examined by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons who shall be selected by the board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the board finds that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a general employee, the board shall recommend to the city that the retiree be returned to performance of duty as a general employee, and the retiree so returned shall enjoy the same rights that he had at the time he was placed upon pension. In the event the retiree so ordered to return shall refuse to comply with the order within 30 days from the issuance thereof, he shall forfeit the right to his pension. 
    The cost of the physical examination and/or re-examination of the member claiming or the retiree receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by the board incident to the physical examination, such as, but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the fund. 
    If the retiree recovers from disability and reenters the service of the city as a general employee, his service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he reentered the service of the city will not be considered as credited service for the purposes of the system. 
    The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability claims. 
(d)  Disability payments. The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled in the event of the member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be: 
(1)  If the retiree recovers from the disability, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery, or 
(2)  If the retiree dies without recovering from disability, the payment due next preceding his death. 
    Provided, however, the disability retiree may select, at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in subsections 38-120(a)(1) or (a)(2), which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit. 
(e)  Benefit offset. When a retiree is receiving a disability pension and workers' compensation and/or Social Security disability benefits pursuant to F.S. Ch. 440, for the same disability, and the total monthly benefits received from each combined exceed 100 percent of the member's average monthly wage, as defined in F.S. Ch. 440, the disability pension benefit shall be reduced so that the total monthly amount received by the retiree does not exceed 100 percent of such average monthly wage. The amount of any lump sum workers' compensation payment shall be converted to an equivalent monthly benefit payable for ten years certain by dividing the lump sum amount by 83.9692. 
(Ord. No. 1332-10, § 1(8), 9-14-2010; Ord. No. 1449-17 , § 4, 7-11-2017) 
Sec. 38-119. - Vesting. 
    If a member terminates his employment as a general employee, either voluntarily or by discharge, and is not eligible for any other benefits under this system, the member shall be entitled to the following: 
(1)  If the member has less than ten years credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a refund of his accumulated contributions or the member may leave it deposited with the fund. 
(2)  If the member has ten or more years of credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a monthly retirement benefit, determined in the same manner as for normal or early retirement and based upon the member's credited service, average final compensation and the benefit accrual rate as of the date of termination, payable to him commencing at member's otherwise normal or early retirement date, determined based upon actual years of credited service, provided he does not elect to withdraw his accumulated contributions and provided the member survives to his otherwise normal or early retirement date. If the member does not withdraw his accumulated contributions and does not survive to his otherwise normal or early retirement date, his designated beneficiary shall be entitled to a refund of 100 percent of the member's accumulated contributions. 
(Ord. No. 1332-10, § 1(9), 9-14-2010) 
Sec. 38-120. - Optional forms of benefits. 
(a)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early retirement as specified herein, a member, upon written request to the board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one of the following options: 
(1)  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the retiree during the lifetime of the retiree and following the death of the retiree, 100 percent, 75 percent, 66 and two-thirds percent or 50 percent of such monthly amount payable to a joint pensioner for his lifetime. Except where the retiree's joint pensioner is his spouse, the payments to the joint pensioner as a percentage of the payments to the retiree shall not exceed the applicable percentage provided for in the applicable table in the treasury regulations. (See Q & A-2 of 1.401(a)(9)-6). 
(2)  A retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the retiree for his lifetime, but with 120 payments guaranteed in any event. 
(3)  If a member retires prior to the time at which Social Security benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as Social Security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the system, based upon the Social Security law in effect at the time of the member's retirement. 
(b)  The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner (subsection (a)(2) above) or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system in the event of member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner or beneficiary and member's retirement income benefits have commenced, the member may thereafter change his designated beneficiary at any time, but may only change his joint pensioner if the designated joint pensioner and the member were married at the time of member's retirement and are divorced subsequent thereto and the joint pensioner is alive at the time of the change. In the absence of proof of good health of the joint pensioner being replaced, the actuary will assume that the joint pensioner has deceased for purposes of calculating the new payment. 
(c)  The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously-designated beneficiaries to receive benefits under the system shall thereupon cease. 
(d)  Upon change of a retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this section, the amount of the retirement income payable to the retiree shall be actuarially determined to take into account the age and sex of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the retiree. Any such retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board and on completion will be filed with the board. In the event that no designated beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the retiree subsequent to his retirement shall be paid as provided in section 38-121. 
(e)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(1)  If a member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under section 38-117. 
(2)  If the designated beneficiary {or beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the member's retirement under the system, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his retirement. 
(3)  If both the retiree and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by member or retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a), the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with section 38-121. 
(4)  If a member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of subsection 38-116(a), and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the member in the amount or amounts computed as if the member had retired under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
(5)  The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 70 and one-half or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(f)  A retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
(g)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board in its discretion, may elect to make a lump sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the total commuted value of the monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed $1,000.00. Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to such member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons.

Sec. 38-121. - Beneficiaries. 
(a)  Each member or retiree may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the board, designate a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the event of his death. Each designation maybe revoked or changed by such member or retiree by signing and filing with the board a new designation-of-beneficiary form. Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the system shall cease. 
(b)  If a deceased member or retiree failed to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection (a), or if the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) named by a deceased member or retiree predeceases the member or retiree, the death benefit, if any, which maybe payable under the system with respect to such deceased member or retiree, shall be paid to the estate of the member or retiree and the board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum. 
(c)  Any payment made to any person pursuant to this section shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to the deceased member and any other persons with rights under the system and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 1332-10, § 1(11), 9-14-2010) 
Sec. 38-122. - Claims procedures. 
(a)  The board shall establish administrative claims procedures to be utilized in processing written requests ("claims"), on matters which affect the substantial rights of any person ("claimant"), including members, retirees, beneficiaries, or any person affected by a decision of the board. 
(b)  The board shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents for discovery prior to and at any proceedings provided for in the board's claims procedures. The claimant may request in writing the issuance of subpoenas by the board. A reasonable fee may be charged for the issuance of any subpoenas not to exceed the fees set forth in Florida Statutes. 
(Ord. No. 1332-10, § 1(12), 9-14-2010) 
Sec. 38-123. - Roster of retirees. 
    The secretary of the board shall keep a record of all persons enjoying a pension under the provisions of this article in which it shall be noted the time when the pension is allowed and when the same shall cease to be paid. Additionally, the secretary shall keep a record of all members in such a manner as to show the name, address, date of employment and date of termination of employment. 
(Ord. No. 1332-10, § 1(13), 9-14-2010) 
Sec. 38-124. - Maximum pension. 
(a)  Basic limitation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this system to the contrary, the member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the system shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of Section 415 of the Code for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in Section 415(b) of the Code, subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in Section 415(b)(1)(A) of the Code, ($160,000.00), subject to the applicable adjustments in Section 415(b) of the Code and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this system. For purposes of this section, "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
    For purposes of Code Section 415(b), the "annual benefit" means a benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) without regard to the benefit attributable to after-tax employee contributions (except pursuant to Code Section 415(n) and to rollover contributions (as defined in Code Section 415(b)(2)(A)). The "benefit attributable" shall be determined in accordance with treasury regulations. 
(b)  Adjustments to basic limitation for form of benefit. If the benefit under the plan is other than the annual benefit described in subsection (a), then the benefit shall be adjusted so that it is the equivalent of the annual benefit, using factors prescribed in treasury regulations. If the form of the benefit without regard to any automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity or a qualified joint and survivor annuity, then the preceding sentence is applied by either reducing the Code Section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date or adjusting the form of benefit to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the additional benefits under the form of benefit as follows: 
(1)  For a benefit paid in a form to which Section 417(e)(3) of the Code does not apply (generally, a monthly benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greater of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit to the member; or 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the member, computed using a five percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Rulings 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code); or 
(2)  For a benefit paid in a form to which Section 417(e)(3) of the Code applies (generally, a lump sum benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greatest of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in the plan for actuarial experience; 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using a 5.5 percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code); or 
c.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable (computed using the applicable interest rate for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) (the 30-year Treasury rate (prior to January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the month prior to retirement, and on and after January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the first day of the plan year with a one-year stabilization period)) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code), divided by 1.05. 
(3)  The actuary may adjust the Section 415(b) limit at the annuity starting date in accordance with subsections (1) and (2) above. 
(c)  Benefits not taken into account. For purposes of this section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
(1)  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
(2)  Any other benefit not required under Section 415(b)(2) of the Code and regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of Code Section 415(b)(1); and 
(3)  That portion of any joint and survivor annuity that constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity. 
(d)  COLA Effect. Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b) (the "limit"), the following will apply: 
(1)  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first limitation year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
(2)  Thereafter, in any subsequent limitation year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under Code Section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
(3)  In no event shall a member's benefit payable under the system in any limitation year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code Section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
    Unless otherwise specified in the system, for purposes of applying the limits under Section 415(b) of the Code, a member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost-of-living increases as required by Section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable Treasury Regulations. 
(e)  Other adjustments in limitations. 
(1)  In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age 62, the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of Section 415(b) of the Code, so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a $160,000.00 annual benefit beginning at age 62. 
(2)  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least 15 years of credited service as a full-time employee of the police or fire department of the city, the adjustments provided for in subsection (e)(1) above shall not apply. 
(3)  The reductions provided for in subsection (e)(1) above shall not be applicable to disability benefits pursuant to section 38-118, or preretirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 38-117. 
(4)  In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age 65, for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (a) herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age 65. This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. 
(f)  Less than ten years of participation. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any member who has completed less than ten years of participation with the city shall be the amount determined under subsection (a) of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of participation and the denominator of which is ten. The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below ten percent of the limit determined without regard to this subsection. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to pre-retirement disability benefits paid pursuant to section 38-118, or preretirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 38-117. 
(g)  Participation in other defined benefit plans. The limit of this section with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in Section 414(j) of the Code maintained by the city shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all city defined benefit plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one plan. 
(h)  Ten thousand dollar limit; less than ten years of service. Notwithstanding anything in this section 38-124, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this subsection (h) of section 38-124 if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this system and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the city contributes, do not exceed $10,000.00 for the applicable limitation year and for any prior limitation year and the city has not any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated; provided, however, that if the member has completed less than ten years of credited service with the city, the limit under this subsection (h) of section 38-124 shall be a reduced limit equal to $10,000.00 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten. 
(i)  Reduction of benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(j)  Service credit purchase limits. 
(1)  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a member makes one or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the system, as allowed in section 38-135, then the requirements of this section will be treated as met only if: 
a.  The requirements of Section 415(b) of the Code are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of Section 415(b) of the Code; or 
b.  The requirements of section 415(c) of the Code are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of Section 415(c) of the Code. 
For purposes of applying subsection (j)(1)a., the system will not fail to meet the reduced limit under Section 415(b)(2)(c) of the Code solely by reason of this subsection, and for purposes of applying subsection (j)(1)b. the system will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under Section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code solely by reason of this subsection. 
(2)  For purposes of this subsection the term "permissive service credit" means service credit: 
a.  Recognized by the system for purposes of calculating a member's benefit under the plan; 
b.  Which such member has not received under the plan; and 
c.  Which such member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the system, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
    Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the system, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding clause (j)(2)b., may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a member is receiving under the system. 
(k)  Contribution limits. 
(1)  For purposes of applying the Code Section 415(c) limits which are incorporated by reference and for purposes of this subsection (k), only and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable will be compensation actually paid or made available during a limitation year, except as noted below and as permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the system, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of Section 3401(a) of the Code and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under Sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052 of the Code and will be determined without regard to any rules under Section 3401(a) of the Code that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Section 3401(a)(2) of the Code). 
a.  However, for limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under Sections 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b) of the Code. For limitation years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of Section 132(f)(4) of the Code. 
b.  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the limitation year will also include compensation paid by the later of 21/2 months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
1.  The payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
2.  The payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
c.  Back pay, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this definition. 
(2)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the board may modify a request by a member to make a contribution to the system if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in Section 415 of the Code by using the following methods: 
a.  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the board may establish a periodic payment deduction plan for the member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under Sections 415(c) or 415(n) of the Code. 
b.  If payment pursuant to subsection (k)(2)a. will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by Section 415(c) of the Code, the board may either reduce the member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the member's contribution. 
(3)  If the annual additions for any member for a limitation year exceed the limitation under Section 415(c) of the Code, the excess annual addition will be corrected as permitted under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (or similar IRS correction program). 
(4)  For limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, a member's compensation for purposes of this subsection (k) shall not exceed the annual limit under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code. 
(l)  Additional limitation on pension benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
(1)  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of the system and who has not previously participated in such system, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed 100 percent of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
(2)  No member of the system shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to Social Security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 1223, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
(m)  Effect of direct rollover on 415(b) limit. If the plan accepts a direct rollover of an employee's or former employee's benefit from a defined contribution plan qualified under Code Section 401(a) which is maintained by the employer, any annuity resulting from the rollover amount that is determined using a more favorable actuarial basis than required under Code Section 417(e) shall be included in the annual benefit for purposes of the limit under Code Section 415(b). 
(Ord. No. 1332-10, § 1(14), 9-14-2010; Ord. No. 1399-13 , § 2, 10-8-2013; Ord. No. 1449-17 , § 6, 7-11-2017) 
Sec. 38-125. - Minimum distribution of benefits.

(2)  Death of member before distributions begin. If the member dies before distributions begin, the member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than as follows: 
a.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age 70 and one-half if later, as the surviving spouse elects.

c.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death, the member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
d.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection (b)(2), other than subsection (b)(2)a., will apply as if the surviving spouse were the member. 
For purposes of this subsection (b)(2), distributions are considered to begin on the member's required beginning date or, if subsection (b)(2)d. applies, the date of distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required beginning date (or to the member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a.), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence.

(3)  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues.

(b)  If this article shall be repealed, or if contributions to the system are discontinued or if there is a transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions as provided in F.S. Ch. 121, the board shall continue to administer the system in accordance with the provisions of this article, for the sole benefit of the then members, any beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one of the options provided for in this article who are designated by any of said members.

(2)  The board shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or otherwise, for each general employee entitled to benefits under the plan as specified in subsection (c)(3). 
(3)  The board shall distribute the asset value as of the date of termination in the manner set forth in this subsection, on the basis that the amount required to provide any given retirement income is the actuarially computed single-sum value of such retirement income, except that if the method of distribution determined under subsection (c)(2) involves the purchase of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given retirement income is the single premium payable for such annuity. The actuarial single-sum value may not be less than the general employee's accumulated contributions to the plan, with interest if provided by the plan, less the value of any plan benefits previously paid to the general employee. 
(4)  If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection (c)(3), and after the payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the city.

Sec. 38-132. - Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions; elimination of mandatory distribution. 
(a)  Rollover distributions. 
(1)  General. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the system to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions. 
a.  Eligible rollover distribution: An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income. Effective January 1, 2002, any portion of any distribution which would be includible in gross income as after-tax employee contributions will be an eligible rollover distribution if the distribution is made to an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code; to an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code; to a qualified defined contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible; or on or after January 1, 2007, to a qualified defined benefit plan described in Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a) or to an annuity contract described in Internal Revenue Code Section 403(b), that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not so includible. 
b.  Eligible retirement plan: An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code; an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code; an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code; effective January 1, 2002, an eligible deferred compensation plan described in Section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by an eligible employer described in Section 457(e)(1)(A) of the Code and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan; effective January 1, 2002, an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code; a qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the Code; or effective January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described in Section 408A of the Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. This definition shall also apply in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse. 
c.  Distributee: A distributee includes an employee or former employee. It also includes the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse. Effective January 1, 2007, it further includes a nonspouse beneficiary who is a designated beneficiary as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9)(E). However, a nonspouse beneficiary may rollover the distribution only to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving the distribution and the account or annuity will be treated as an "inherited" individual retirement account or annuity. 
d.  Direct rollover: A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(b)  Rollovers or transfers into the fund. On or after January 1, 2002, the system will accept, solely for the purpose of purchasing credited service as provided herein, permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans, member rollover cash contributions and/or direct cash rollovers of distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, as follows: 
(1)  Transfers and direct rollovers or member rollover contributions from other plans. The system will accept either a direct rollover of an eligible rollover distribution or a member contribution of an eligible rollover distribution from a qualified plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code, from an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code or from an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state. The system will also accept legally permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans. 
(2)  Member rollover contributions from IRAs. The system will accept a member rollover contribution of the portion of a distribution from an individual retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or 408(b) of the Code that is eligible to be rolled over. 
(c)  Elimination of mandatory distributions. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event this plan provides for a mandatory (involuntary) cash distribution from the plan not otherwise required by law, for an amount in excess of $1,000.00, such distribution shall be made from the plan only upon written request of the member and completion by the member of a written election on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount.

(4)  The maximum credit under this section for service other than with the City of Milton when combined with service purchased pursuant to section 38-135 shall be five years of credited service and shall count for all purposes, except vesting and eligibility for disability benefits. There shall be no maximum credit under this section for prior service as a general employee with the City of Milton, and credited service purchased shall count for all purposes, including vesting. 
(5)  In no event, however, may credited service be purchased pursuant to this section for prior service with any other municipality, or county, if such prior service forms or will form the basis of a retirement benefit or pension from another retirement system or plan as set forth in section 38-124(1)(2).

The member may, in writing, elect to change his election only once during his DROP participation. An election to change must be made prior to the end of a quarter and shall be effective beginning the following quarter. 
2.  For DROP participation in years six and seven, shall be credited with earnings, to be credited to the member's DROP account, determined as of the last business day of each fiscal year quarter and credited as of such date, determined as follows: 
The average daily balance in a member's DROP account shall be credited at a rate equal to the net investment return realized by the system for that quarter, but not less than zero percent and not greater than 6.5 percent. "Net investment return" for the purpose of this paragraph is the total return of the assets in which the member's DROP account is invested by the board net of brokerage commissions, transaction costs and management fees. 
For purposes of calculating earnings on a member's DROP account pursuant to this subsection (c)(2)b.2., brokerage commissions, transaction costs, and management fees shall be determined for each quarter by the investment consultant pursuant to contracts with fund managers as reported in the custodial statement. The investment consultant shall report these quarterly contractual fees to the board. The investment consultant shall also report the net investment return for each manager and the net investment return for the total plan assets. 
c.  A member's DROP account shall only be credited or debited with earnings or interest and monthly benefits while the member is a participant in the DROP. A member's final DROP account value for distribution to the member upon termination of participation in the DROP shall be the value of the account at the end of the quarter immediately preceding termination of participation for participants electing the net plan return and at the end of the month immediately preceding termination of participation for participants electing the flat interest rate return, plus any monthly periodic additions made to the DROP account subsequent to the end of the previous quarter or month, as applicable, and prior to distribution. If a member is employed by the city after participating in the DROP for the permissible period of participation, then beginning with the member's first month of employment following the last month of the permissible period of DROP participation, the member's DROP account will no longer be credited or debited with earnings or interest, nor will monthly benefits be transferred to the DROP account. All such nontransferred amounts shall be forfeited and continue to be forfeited while the member is employed by the city. A member employed by the city after the permissible period of DROP participation will still not be eligible for preretirement death or disability benefits, nor will he accrue additional credited service, except as provided for in section 38-137. 
(d)  Distribution of DROP accounts on termination of employment. 
(1)  Eligibility for benefits. A member shall receive the balance in his DROP account in accordance with the provisions of this subsection (d) upon his termination of employment as a general employee. Except as provided in subsection (d)(4), no amounts shall be paid to a member from the DROP prior to his termination of employment as a general employee. 
(2)  Form of distribution. 
a.  Unless the member elects otherwise, distribution of his DROP account shall be made in a cash lump sum, subject to the direct rollover provisions set forth in subsection (d)(6). Elections under this subsection shall be in writing and shall be made in such time or manner as the board shall determine. 
b.  If a member dies before his benefit is paid, his DROP account shall be paid to his beneficiary in such optional form as his beneficiary may select. If no beneficiary designation is made, the DROP account shall be distributed to the member's estate. 
(3)  Date of payment of distribution. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (d), distribution of a member's DROP account shall be made as soon as administratively practicable following the member's termination of employment. 
(4)  Proof of death and right of beneficiary or other person. The board may require and rely upon such proof of death and such evidence of the right of any beneficiary or other person to receive the value of a deceased member's DROP account as the board may deem proper and its determination of the right of that beneficiary or other person to receive payment shall be conclusive. 
(5)  Distribution limitation. Notwithstanding any other provision of subsection (d), all distributions from the DROP shall conform to the regulations issued under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code, including the incidental death benefit provisions of Section 401(a)(9)(G) of the Code. Further, such regulations shall override any DROP provision that is inconsistent with Section 401(a)(9) of the Code. 
(6)  Direct rollover of certain distributions. This subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 1993. Notwithstanding any provision of the DROP to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this subsection, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly by the DROP to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover as otherwise provided under the system in section 38-132, herein incorporated by reference. 
(e)  Administration of DROP. 
(1)  Board administers the DROP. The general administration of the DROP, the responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the DROP and the responsibility of overseeing the investment of the DROP's assets shall be placed in the board. The members of the board may appoint from their number such subcommittees with such powers as they shall determine; may adopt such administrative procedures and regulations as they deem desirable for the conduct of their affairs; may authorize one or more of their number or any agent to execute or deliver any instrument or make any payment on their behalf; may retain counsel, employ agents and provide for such clerical, accounting, actuarial and consulting services as they may require in carrying out the provisions of the DROP; and may allocate among themselves or delegate to other persons all or such portion of their duties under the DROP, other than those granted to them as trustee under any trust agreement adopted for use in implementing the DROP, as they, in their sole discretion, shall decide. A trustee shall not vote on any question relating exclusively to himself. 
(2)  Individual accounts, records and reports. The board shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, records showing the operation and condition of the DROP, including records showing the individual balances in each member's DROP account, and the board shall keep, or cause to be kept, in convenient form such data as may be necessary for the valuation of the assets and liabilities of the DROP. The board shall prepare or cause to be prepared and distributed to members participating in the DROP and other individuals or filed with the appropriate governmental agencies, as the case may be, all necessary descriptions, reports, information returns, and data required to be distributed or filed for the DROP pursuant to the Code and any other applicable laws. 
(3)  Establishment of rules. Subject to the limitations of the DROP, the board from time to time shall establish rules for the administration of the DROP and the transaction of its business. The board shall have discretionary authority to construe and interpret the DROP (including but not limited to determination of an individual's eligibility for DROP participation, the right and amount of any benefit payable under the DROP and the date on which any individual ceases to be a participant in the DROP). The determination of the board as to the interpretation of the DROP or its determination of any disputed questions shall be conclusive and final to the extent permitted by applicable law. The board shall also oversee the investment of the DROP's assets. 
(4)  Limitation of liability. 
a.  The trustees shall not incur any liability individually or on behalf of any other individuals for any act or failure to act, made in good faith in relation to the DROP or the funds of the DROP. 
b.  Neither the board nor any trustee of the board shall be responsible for any reports furnished by any expert retained or employed by the board, but they shall be entitled to rely thereon as well as on certificates furnished by an accountant or an actuary, and on all opinions of counsel. The board shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in reliance upon such expert, accountant, actuary or counsel, and all actions taken or suffered in such reliance shall be conclusive upon any person with any interest in the DROP. 
(f)  General provisions. 
(1)  The DROP is not a separate retirement plan. Instead, it is a program under which a member who is eligible for normal retirement under the system may elect to accrue future retirement benefits in the manner provided in this section 38-136 for the remainder of his employment, rather than in the normal manner provided under the plan. Upon termination of employment, a member is entitled to a lump sum distribution of his or her DROP account balance or may elect a rollover. The DROP account distribution is in addition to the member's monthly benefit. 
(2)  Notional account. The DROP account established for such a member is a notional account, used only for the purpose of calculation of the DROP distribution amount. It is not a separate account in the system. There is no change in the system's assets, and there is no distribution available to the member until the member's termination from the DROP. The member has no control over the investment of the DROP account. 
(3)  No employer discretion. The DROP benefit is determined pursuant to a specific formula which does not involve employer discretion. 
(4)  IRC limit. The DROP account distribution, along with other benefits payable from the system, is subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b). 
(5)  Amendment of DROP. The DROP may be amended by an ordinance of the city at any time and from time to time, and retroactively if deemed necessary or appropriate, to amend in whole or in part any or all of the provisions of the DROP. However, except as otherwise provided by law, no amendment shall make it possible for any part of the DROP's funds to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of persons entitled to benefits under the DROP. No amendment shall be made which has the effect of decreasing the balance of the DROP account of any member. 
(6)  Facility of payment. If the board shall find that a member or other person entitled to a benefit under the DROP is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident or is a minor, the board may direct that any benefit due him, unless claim shall have been made for the benefit by a duly appointed legal representative, be paid to his spouse, a child, a parent or other blood relative, or to a person with whom he resides. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of the liabilities of the DROP for that benefit. 
(7)  Information. Each member, beneficiary or other person entitled to a benefit, before any benefit shall be payable to him or on his account under the DROP, shall file with the board the information that it shall require to establish his rights and benefits under the DROP. 
(8)  Prevention of escheat. If the board cannot ascertain the whereabouts of any person to whom a payment is due under the DROP, the board may, no earlier than three years from the date such payment is due, mail a notice of such due and owing payment to the last known address of such person, as shown on the records of the board or the city. If such person has not made written claim therefor within three months of the date of the mailing, the board may, if it so elects and upon receiving advice from counsel to the DROP, direct that such payment and all remaining payments otherwise due such person be canceled on the records of the DROP. Upon such cancellation, the DROP shall have no further liability therefor except that, in the event such person or his beneficiary later notifies the board of his whereabouts and requests the payment or payments due to him under the DROP, the amount so applied shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of the DROP. 
(9)  Written elections, notification. 
a.  Any elections, notifications or designations made by a member pursuant to the provisions of the DROP shall be made in writing and filed with the board in a time and manner determined by the board under rules uniformly applicable to all employees similarly situated. The board reserves the right to change from time to time the manner for making notifications, elections or designations by members under the DROP if it determines after due deliberation that such action is justified in that it improves the administration of the DROP. In the event of a conflict between the provisions for making an election, notification or designation set forth in the DROP and such new administrative procedures, those new administrative procedures shall prevail. 
b.  Each member or retiree who has a DROP account shall be responsible for furnishing the board with his current address and any one subsequent changes in his address. Any notice required to be given to a member or retiree hereunder shall be deemed given if directed to him at the last such address given to the board and mailed by registered or certified United States mail. If any check mailed by registered or certified United States mail to such address is returned, mailing of checks will be suspended until such time as the member or retiree notifies the board of his address. 
(10)  Benefits not guaranteed. All benefits payable to a member from the DROP shall be paid only from the assets of the member's DROP account and neither the city nor the board shall have any duty or liability to furnish the DROP with any funds, securities or other assets except to the extent required by any applicable law. 
(11)  Construction. 
a.  The DROP shall be construed, regulated and administered under the laws of Florida, except where other applicable law controls. 
b.  The titles and headings of the subsections in this section 38-137 are for convenience only. In the case of ambiguity or inconsistency, the text rather than the titles or headings shall control. 
(12)  Forfeiture of retirement benefits. Nothing in this section shall be construed to remove DROP participants from the application of any forfeiture provisions applicable to the system. DROP participants shall be subject to forfeiture of all retirement benefits, including DROP benefits. 
(13)  Effect of DROP participation on employment. Participation in the DROP is not a guarantee of employment and DROP participants shall be subject to the same employment standards and policies that are applicable to employees who are not DROP participants. 
(Ord. No. 1332-10, § 1(26), 9-14-2010; Ord. No. 1432-16 , § 1, 8-9-2016; Ord. No. 1449-17 , § 8, 7-11-2017) 
Sec. 38-137. - Reemployment after retirement. 
(a)  Any retiree who is retired under this system, except for disability retirement as previously provided for, may be reemployed by any public or private employer, except the city, and may receive compensation from that employment without limiting or restricting in any way the retirement benefits payable under this system. Reemployment by the city shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this section. 
(b)  After normal retirement. Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed by the city in any capacity, shall upon being reemployed, continue receipt of retirement benefits during any such employment period if he is at least age 62, otherwise the system shall discontinue receipt of benefits until he reaches age 62. A retiree who returns to work under the provisions of this section shall not be eligible for membership in this system and, therefore, shall not accumulate additional credited service for subsequent periods of employment described in this section, shall not be required to make contributions to the system, nor shall he be eligible for any other benefit other than the retiree's normal retirement benefit. 
(c)  Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed by the city after that retirement and, by virtue of that reemployment is ineligible to participate in this system, shall, during the period of such reemployment, continue to receive retirement benefits previously earned if he is at least age 62, otherwise the system shall discontinue receipt of benefits until he reaches age 62. Former DROP participants shall begin receipt of benefits under these circumstances. 
(d)  After early retirement. Any retiree who is retired under early retirement pursuant to this system and who subsequently becomes an employee of the city in any capacity, shall discontinue receipt of benefits from the system until the earlier of termination of employment or such time as the reemployed retiree reaches age 62. A retiree who returns to work under the provisions of this section shall not be eligible for membership in the system, and, therefore, shall not accumulate additional credited service for subsequent periods of employment described in this section, shall not be required to make contributions to the system, nor shall he be eligible for any other benefit other than the retiree's early retirement benefit when he again becomes eligible as provided herein. Retirement pursuant to an early retirement incentive program shall be deemed early retirement for purposes of this section if the member was permitted to retire prior to the customary retirement date provided for in the system at the time of retirement. 
(e)  Reemployment of terminated vested persons. Reemployed terminated vested persons shall not be subject to the provisions of this section until such time as they begin to actually receive benefits. Upon receipt of benefits, terminated vested persons shall be treated as normal or early retirees for purposes of applying the provisions of this section and their status as an early or normal retiree shall be determined by the date they elect to begin to receive their benefit. 
(f)  DROP participants. Retirees who are or were in the deferred retirement option plan shall, following termination of employment after DROP participation, have the options provided for in this section for reemployment.

Sec. 38-171. - Definitions. 
(a)  As used herein, unless otherwise defined or required by the context, the following words and phrases shall have the meaning indicated: 
    Accumulated contributions means a member's own contributions without interest. For those members who purchase credited service with interest or at no cost to the system, any payment representing the amount attributable to member contributions based on the applicable member contribution rate, and any payment representing interest and any required actuarially calculated payments for the purchase of such credited service, shall be included in accumulated contributions. 
    Actuarial equivalent means a benefit or amount of equal value, based upon the RP-2000 Combined Healthy Mortality Table and an interest rate of eight percent per annum. This definition may only be amended by the city pursuant to the recommendation of the board using assumptions adopted by the board with the advice of the plan's actuary, such that actuarial assumptions are not subject to city discretion. 
    Average final compensation means one-twelfth of the average salary of the three best years of the last five years of credited service prior to retirement, termination, or death. A year shall be 12 consecutive months. 
    Beneficiary means the person or persons entitled to receive benefits hereunder at the death of a member who has or have been designated in writing by the member and filed with the board. If no such designation is in effect, or if no person so designated is living, at the time of death of the member, the beneficiary shall be the estate of the member. 
    Board means the board of trustees, which shall administer and manage the system herein provided and serve as trustees of the fund. 
    City means City of Milton, Florida. 
    Code means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. 
    Credited service means the total number of years and fractional parts of years of service as a police officer with member contributions, when required, omitting intervening years or fractional parts of years when such member was not employed by the city as a police officer. A member may voluntarily leave his accumulated contributions in the fund for a period of five years after leaving the employ of the police department pending the possibility of being reemployed as a police officer, without losing credit for the time that he was a member of the system. If a vested member leaves the employ of the police department, his accumulated contributions will be returned only upon his written request. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed as a police officer with the police department within five years, his accumulated contributions, if $1,000.00 or less, shall be returned. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed within five years, his accumulated contributions, if more than $1,000.00, will be returned only upon the written request of the member and upon completion of a written election to receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount on forms designated by the board. Upon return of a member's accumulated contributions, all of his rights and benefits under the system are forfeited and terminated. Upon any reemployment, a police officer shall not receive credit for the years and fractional parts of years of service for which he has withdrawn his accumulated contributions from the fund, unless the police officer repays into the fund the contributions he has withdrawn, with interest, as determined by the board, within 90 days after his reemployment. 
    The years or fractional parts of a year that a member performs "qualified military service" consisting of voluntary or involuntary "service in the uniformed services" as defined in the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) (P.L. 103-353), after separation from employment as a police officer with the city to perform training or service, shall be added to his years of credited service for all purposes, including vesting, provided that: 
(1)  The member is entitled to reemployment under the provisions of USERRA. 
(2)  The member returns to his employment as a police officer within one year from the earlier of the date of his military discharge or his release from active service, unless otherwise required by USERRA. 
(3)  The maximum credit for military service pursuant to this subsection shall be five years. 
(4)  This subsection is intended to satisfy the minimum requirements of USERRA. To the extent that this subsection does not meet the minimum standards of USERRA, as it may be amended from time to time, the minimum standards shall apply. 
    In the event a member dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing USERRA qualified military service, the beneficiaries of the member are entitled to any benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) as if the member had resumed employment and then died while employed. 
    Beginning January 1, 2009, to the extent required by Section 414(u)(12) of the Code, an individual receiving differential wage payments (as defined under Section 3401(h)(2) of the Code) from an employer shall be treated as employed by that employer, and the differential wage payment shall be treated as compensation for purposes of applying the limits on annual additions under Section 415(c) of the Code. This provision shall be applied to all similarly situated individuals in a reasonably equivalent manner. 
    Fund means the trust fund established herein as part of the system. 
    Member means an actively employed police officer who fulfills the prescribed membership requirements. Benefit improvements which, in the past, have been provided for by amendments to the system adopted by city ordinance, and any benefit improvements which might be made in the future shall apply prospectively and shall not apply to members who terminate employment or who retire prior to the effective date of any ordinance adopting such benefit improvements, unless such ordinance specifically provides to the contrary. 
    Plan year means the 12-month period beginning October 1 and ending September 30 of the following year. 
    Police officer means an actively employed full-time person, employed by the city, including his initial probationary employment period, who is certified as a police officer as a condition of employment in accordance with the provisions of F.S. § 943.1395, who is vested with authority to bear arms and make arrests, and whose primary responsibility is the prevention and detection of crime or the enforcement of the penal, traffic, or highway laws of the State of Florida. 
    Retiree means a member who has entered retirement status. 
    Retirement means a member's separation from city employment with eligibility for immediate receipt of benefits under the system. 
    Salary means the total compensation for services rendered to the city as a police officer reportable on the member's W-2 form plus all tax deferred, tax sheltered, or tax exempt items of income derived from elective employee payroll deductions or salary reductions. For service earned on or after July 1, 2011, Salary shall not include more than 300 hours of overtime per fiscal year. Provided however, in any event, payments for overtime in excess of 300 hours per year accrued as of July 1, 2011 and attributable to service earned prior to the July 1, 2011, may still be included in salary for pension purposes even if the payment is not actually made until on or after July 1, 2011. In any event, with respect to unused sick leave and unused annual leave accrued prior to July 1, 2011, salary will include the lesser of the amount of sick or annual leave time accrued on July 1, 2011 or the actual amount of sick or annual leave time for which the retiree receives payment at the time of retirement, regardless of whether the amount of sick or annual leave was, at some time prior to retirement, reduced below the amount on July 1, 2011. 
    Compensation in excess of the limitations set forth in Section 401(a)(17) of the Code as of the first day of the plan year shall be disregarded for any purpose, including employee contributions or any benefit calculations. The annual compensation of each member taken into account in determining benefits or employee contributions for any plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, may not exceed $200,000.00, as adjusted for cost-of-living increases in accordance with Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17)(B). Compensation means compensation during the fiscal year. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination period that begins with or within such calendar year. If the determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the annual compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period, and the denominator of which is 12. If the compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a member's contributions or benefits for the current plan year, the compensation for such prior determination period is subject to the applicable annual compensation limit in effect for that prior period. The limitation on compensation for an "eligible employee" shall not be less than the amount which was allowed to be taken into account hereunder as in effect on July 1, 1993. "Eligible employee" is an individual who was a member before the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1995. 
    Spouse means the lawful wife or husband of a member or retiree at the time benefits become payable. 
    System means the City of Milton Police Officers' Pension Trust Fund as contained herein and all amendments thereto. 
(b)  Masculine gender. The masculine gender, where used herein, unless the context specifically requires otherwise, shall include both the feminine and masculine genders.

(a)  The sole and exclusive administration of and responsibility for the proper operation of the system and for making effective the provisions of this article is hereby vested in a board of trustees. The board is hereby designated as the plan administrator. The board shall consist of five trustees, two of whom, unless otherwise prohibited by law, shall be legal residents of the city, who shall be appointed by the Milton City Council, and two of whom shall be members of the system, who shall be elected by a majority of the police officers who are members of the system. The fifth trustee shall be chosen by a majority of the previous four trustees as provided for herein, and such person's name shall be submitted to the Milton City Council. Upon receipt of the fifth person's name, the Milton City Council shall, as a ministerial duty, appoint such person to the board of trustees as its fifth trustee. The fifth trustee shall have the same rights as each of the other four trustees appointed or elected as herein provided and shall serve a four-year term unless he sooner vacates the office. Each resident trustee shall serve as trustee for a period of four years, unless he sooner vacates the office or is sooner replaced by the Milton City Council at whose pleasure he shall serve. Each member trustee shall serve as trustee for a period of four years, unless he sooner leaves the employment of the city as a police officer or otherwise vacates his office as trustee, whereupon a successor shall be chosen in the same manner as the departing trustee. Each trustee may succeed himself in office. The board shall establish and administer the nominating and election procedures for each election. The board shall meet at least quarterly each year. The board shall be a legal entity with, in addition to other powers and responsibilities contained herein, the power to bring and defend lawsuits of every kind, nature, and description. 
(b)  The trustees shall, by a majority vote, elect a chairman and a secretary. The secretary of the board shall keep a complete minute book of the actions, proceedings, or hearings of the board. The trustees shall not receive any compensation as such, but may receive expenses and per diem as provided by law. 
(c)  Each trustee shall be entitled to one vote on the board. Three affirmative votes shall be necessary for any decision by the trustees at any meeting of the board. A trustee shall have the right to abstain from voting as the result of a conflict of interest provided that trustee complies with the provisions of F.S. § 112.3143. 
(d)  The board shall engage such actuarial, accounting, legal, and other services as shall be required to transact the business of the system. The compensation of all persons engaged by the board and all other expenses of the board necessary for the operation of the system shall be paid from the fund at such rates and in such amounts as the board shall agree. In the event the board chooses to use the city's legal counsel, actuary or other professional, technical or other advisors, it shall do so only under terms and conditions acceptable to the board. 
(e)  The duties and responsibilities of the board shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following: 
(1)  To construe the provisions of the system and determine all questions arising thereunder. 
(2)  To determine all questions relating to eligibility and membership. 
(3)  To determine and certify the amount of all retirement allowances or other benefits hereunder.

Sec. 38-174. - Finances and fund management. 
    Establishment and operation of fund. 
(1)  As part of the system, there is hereby established the fund, into which shall be deposited all of the contributions and assets whatsoever attributable to the system, including the assets of the prior police officers' pension trust fund. 
(2)  The actual custody and supervision of the fund (and assets thereof) shall be vested in the board. Payment of benefits and disbursements from the fund shall be made by the disbursing agent but only upon written authorization from the board. 
(3)  All funds of the police officers' pension trust fund may be deposited by the board with the city clerk, acting in a ministerial capacity only, who shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as he is liable for the safekeeping of funds for the city. However, any funds so deposited with the city clerk shall be kept in a separate fund by the city clerk or clearly identified as such funds of the police officers' pension trust fund. In lieu thereof, the board shall deposit the funds of the police officers' pension trust fund in a qualified public depository as defined in F.S. § 280.02, which depository with regard to such funds shall conform to and be bound by all of the provisions of F.S. Ch. 280. In order to fulfill its investment responsibilities as set forth herein, the board may retain the services of a custodian bank, an investment advisor registered under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 or otherwise exempt from such required registration, an insurance company, or a combination of these, for the purposes of investment decisions and management. Such investment manager shall have discretion, subject to any guidelines as prescribed by the board, in the investment of all fund assets. 
(4)  All funds and securities of the system may be commingled in the fund, provided that accurate records are maintained at all times reflecting the financial composition of the fund, including accurate current accounts and entries as regards the following: 
a.  Current amounts of accumulated contributions of members on both an individual and aggregate account basis, and 
b.  Receipts and disbursements, and 
c.  Benefit payments, and 
d.  Current amounts clearly reflecting all monies, funds and assets whatsoever attributable to contributions and deposits from the city, and 
e.  All interest, dividends and gains (or losses) whatsoever, and 
f.  Such other entries as may be properly required so as to reflect a clear and complete financial report of the fund. 
(5)  An audit shall be performed annually by a certified public accountant for the most recent fiscal year of the system showing a detailed listing of assets and a statement of all income and disbursements during the year. Such income and disbursements must be reconciled with the assets at the beginning and end of the year. Such report shall reflect a complete evaluation of assets on both a cost and market basis, as well as other items normally included in a certified audit. 
(6)  The board shall have the following investment powers and authority: 
a.  The board shall be vested with full legal title to said fund, subject, however, and in any event to the authority and power of the Milton City Council to amend or terminate this fund, provided that no amendment or fund termination shall ever result in the use of any assets of this fund except for the payment of regular expenses and benefits under this system, except as otherwise provided herein. All contributions from time to time paid into the fund, and the income thereof, without distinction between principal and income, shall be held and administered by the board or its agent in the fund and the board shall not be required to segregate or invest separately any portion of the fund. 
b.  All monies paid into or held in the fund shall be invested and reinvested by the board and the investment of all or any part of such funds shall be subject to the following: 
1.  Notwithstanding any limitation provided for in F.S. ch. 185 to the contrary (unless such limitation may not be amended by local ordinance) or any limitation in prior city ordinances to the contrary, all monies paid into or held in the fund may be invested and reinvested in such securities, investment vehicles or property wherever situated and of whatever kind, as shall be approved by the board, including but not limited to common or preferred stocks, bonds, and other evidences of indebtedness or ownership. In no event, however, shall more than 25 percent of the assets of the fund at market value be invested in foreign securities. 
2.  The board shall develop and adopt a written investment policy statement setting forth permissible types of investments, goals and objectives of investments and setting quality and quantity limitations on investments in accordance with the recommendations of its investment consultants. The investment policy statement shall be reviewed by the board at least annually. 
3.  In addition, the board may, upon recommendation by the board's investment consultant, make investments in group trusts meeting the requirements of Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 81-100 and Revenue Ruling 2011-1 or successor rulings or guidance of similar import, and operated or maintained exclusively for the commingling and collective investment of monies, provided that the funds in the group trust consist exclusively of trust assets held under plans qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, individual retirement accounts that are exempt under Section 408(e) of the Code, eligible governmental plans that meet the requirements of Section 457(b) of the Code, and governmental plans under Section 401(a)(24) of the Code. For this purpose, a trust includes a custodial account that is treated as a trust under Section 401(f) or under Section 457(g)(3) of the Code. While any portion of the assets of the fund are invested in such a group trust, such group trust is itself adopted as a part of the system or plan. 
c.  At least once every three years, and more often as determined by the board, the board shall retain a professionally qualified independent consultant, as defined in F.S. § 185.06, to evaluate the performance of all current investment managers and make recommendations regarding the retention of all such investment managers. These recommendations shall be considered by the board at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
d.  The board may retain in cash and keep unproductive of income such amount of the fund as it may deem advisable, having regard for the cash requirements of the system. 
e.  Neither the board nor any trustee shall be liable for the making, retention or sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of the fund, except that due to his or its own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. 
f.  The board may cause any investment in securities held by it to be registered in or transferred into its name as trustee or into the name of such nominee as it may direct, or it may retain them unregistered and in form permitting transferability, but the books and records shall at all times show that all investments are part of the fund. 
g.  The board is empowered, but is not required, to vote upon any stocks, bonds, or securities of any corporation, association, or trust and to give general or specific proxies or powers of attorney with or without power of substitution; to participate in mergers, reorganizations, recapitalizations, consolidations, and similar transactions with respect to such securities; to deposit such stock or other securities in any voting trust or any protective or like committee with the trustees or with depositories designated thereby; to amortize or fail to amortize any part or all of the premium or discount resulting from the acquisition or disposition of assets; and generally to exercise any of the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, or other investments comprising the fund which it may deem to be to the best interest of the fund to exercise. 
h.  The board shall not be required to make any inventory or appraisal or report to any court, nor to secure any order of court for the exercise of any power contained herein. 
i.  Where any action which the board is required to take or any duty or function which it is required to perform either under the terms herein or under the general law applicable to it as trustee under this article, can reasonably be taken or performed only after receipt by it from a member, the city, or any other entity, of specific information, certification, direction or instructions, the board shall be free of liability in failing to take such action or perform such duty or function until such information, certification, direction or instruction has been received by it. 
j.  Any overpayments or underpayments from the fund to a member, retiree or beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate per annum approved by the board in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member, retiree or beneficiary was correctly entitled, shall be paid. Overpayments shall be charged against payments next succeeding the correction or collected in another manner if prudent. Underpayments shall be made up from the fund in a prudent manner. 
k.  The board shall sustain no liability whatsoever for the sufficiency of the fund to meet the payments and benefits provided for herein. 
l.  In any application to or proceeding or action in the courts, only the board shall be a necessary party, and no member or other person having an interest in the fund shall be entitled to any notice or service of process. Any judgment entered in such a proceeding or action shall be conclusive upon all persons. 
m.  Any of the foregoing powers and functions reposed in the board may be performed or carried out by the board through duly authorized agents, provided that the board at all times maintains continuous supervision over the acts of any such agent; provided further, that legal title to said fund shall always remain in the board.

Sec. 38-175. - Contributions. 
(a)  Member contributions. 
(1)  Amount. Each member of the system shall be required to make regular contributions to the fund in the amount of eight percent of his salary. Member contributions withheld by the city on behalf of the member shall be deposited with the board immediately after each pay period. The contributions made by each member to the fund shall be designated as employer contributions pursuant to Section 414(h) of the Code. Such designation is contingent upon the contributions being excluded from the members' gross income for federal income tax purposes. For all other purposes of the system, such contributions shall be considered to be member contributions. 
(2)  Method. Such contributions shall be made by payroll deduction. 
(b)  State contributions. Any monies received or receivable by reason of laws of the State of Florida, for the express purpose of funding and paying for retirement benefits for police officers of the city shall be deposited in the fund comprising part of this system immediately and under no circumstances more than five days after receipt by the city. 
(c)  City contributions. So long as this system is in effect, the city shall make quarterly contributions to the fund in an amount equal to the required city contribution, as shown by the applicable actuarial valuation of the system. 
(d)  Other. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the fund, but such deposits must be accounted for separately and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis. Funds arising from these sources may be used only for additional benefits for members, as determined by the board, and may not be used to reduce what would have otherwise been required city contributions. 
(Ord. No. 1337-10, § (1)5, 9-9-2010; Ord. No. 1412-14 , § 1, 8-12-2014) 
Sec. 38-176. - Benefit amounts and eligibility.

A member's normal retirement date shall be the first day of the month coincident with, or next following the earlier of the attainment of age 55 years and the completion of ten years of credited service or the completion of 20 years of credited service regardless of age. A member may retire on his normal retirement date or on the first day of any month thereafter, and each member shall become 100 percent vested in his accrued benefit on the member's normal retirement date. Normal retirement under the system is retirement from employment with the city on or after the normal retirement date. 
(b)  Normal retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on or after his normal retirement date shall receive a monthly benefit which shall commence on the first day of the month coincident with or next following his retirement and be continued thereafter during member's lifetime, ceasing upon death, but with 120 monthly payments guaranteed in any event.

In addition, the member shall receive a supplemental benefit of $200.00 per month from the date of retirement to the first day of the month preceding age 65. 
(c)  Early retirement date. A member may retire on his early retirement date which shall be the first day of any month coincident with or next following the attainment of age 50 and ten years of credited service. Early retirement under the system is retirement from employment with the city on or after the early retirement date and prior to the normal retirement date. 
(d)  Early retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on his early retirement date may receive either a deferred or an immediate monthly retirement benefit payable in the same form as for normal retirement as follows: 
(1)  A deferred monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on what would have been his normal retirement date based upon his actual years of credited service as a police officer and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The amount of each such deferred monthly retirement benefit shall be determined in the same manner as for retirement on his normal retirement date, except that credited service and average final compensation shall be determined as of his early retirement date; or 
(2)  An immediate monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on his early retirement date and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The benefit payable shall be as determined in subsection (d)(1) above, determined based on his actual years of credited service as a police officer reduced by three percent for each year by which the commencement of benefits precedes the date which would have been the member's normal retirement date based on his actual years of credited service as a police officer. 
(e)  Cost-of-living adjustment. 
(1)  The board shall periodically review the status of all service retirees, disability retirees and beneficiaries who are receiving payments from the system for the purpose of considering whether to recommend an ad hoc increase in benefits for all such purposes. For purposes of its recommendation regarding the granting of ad hoc cost-of-living increases, and in consideration of the position of the State Division of Retirement, the board shall make a recommendation for an increase only if the net actuarial gains experienced since the most recent adjustment are sufficient to fully purchase the value of the additional benefits. The calculation of net actuarial gains and losses shall be computed by the board's actuary using generally accepted actuarial principles, and the cost method employed in the actuarial valuation of the fund, and shall be in compliance with F.S. § 112.61. 
(2)  All employees retiring after September 26, 2002 whether retired at their early or normal retirement date will receive an annual one percent cost-of-living increase on each October 1. The cost-of-living adjustment shall not apply to disability retirees and terminated vested members. 
(f)  Required distribution date. The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age seventy and one-half or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(g)  Supplemental benefit - thirteenth check. 
(1)  In addition to the benefits provided for above in this section, each "eligible recipient" shall receive a "13th check" each year the investment rate of return exceeds 8.5 percent and the plans funded ratio is 95 percent or higher. An "eligible recipient" is defined as any current or future retiree (including DROP participants), but not beneficiaries (including those receiving pre-retirement death benefits) and joint pensioners, terminated vested persons or their beneficiaries or joint pensioners. 
(Ord. No. 1337-10, § (1)6, 9-9-2010; Ord. No. 1412-14 , § 2, 8-12-2014; Ord. No. 1442-17 , § I, 2-14-2017) 
Sec. 38-177. - Preretirement death. 
(a)  Prior to vesting or eligibility for retirement. The beneficiary of a deceased member who was not receiving monthly benefits or who was not yet vested or eligible for early or normal retirement shall receive a refund of 100 percent of the member's accumulated contributions without interest. 
(b)  Deceased members vested or eligible for retirement with spouse as beneficiary. This subsection (b) applies only when the member's spouse is the sole designated beneficiary. The spouse beneficiary of any member who dies and who, at the date of his death was vested or eligible for early or normal retirement, shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
(1)  If the member was vested, but not eligible for normal or early retirement, the spouse beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten years, beginning on the date that the deceased member would have been eligible for early or normal retirement, at the option of the spouse beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced as for early retirement, if applicable. The spouse beneficiary may also elect to receive an immediate benefit, payable for ten years, which is actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the early retirement date. 
(2)  If the deceased member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the spouse beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten years, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death or at the deceased member's otherwise early or normal retirement date, at the option of the spouse beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced as for early retirement, if applicable. 
(3)  A spouse beneficiary may not elect an optional form of benefit, however, the board may elect to make a lump sum payment pursuant to subsection 38-180(g). 
(4)  A spouse beneficiary may, in lieu of any benefit provided for in (b)(1) or (b)(2) above, elect to receive a refund of the deceased member's accumulated contributions. 
(5)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this section to the contrary, in any event, distributions to the spouse beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date selected pursuant to the above provisions in this section that must be on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained 701/2. 
(6)  If the surviving spouse beneficiary commences receiving a benefit under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2) above, but dies before all payments are made, the actuarial value of the remaining benefit will be paid to the spouse beneficiary's estate in a lump sum. 
(c)  Deceased members vested or eligible for retirement with nonspouse beneficiary. This subsection applies only when the member's spouse is not the beneficiary or is not the sole designated beneficiary, but there is a surviving beneficiary. The beneficiary of any member who dies and who, at the date of his death was vested or eligible for early or normal retirement, shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
(1)  If the member was vested, but not eligible for normal or early retirement, the beneficiary will receive a benefit payable for ten years. The benefit will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. The benefit will be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation and actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the normal retirement date. 
(2)  If the deceased member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the beneficiary will receive a benefit payable for ten years, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death. The benefit will be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced for early retirement, if applicable. 
(3)  A beneficiary may not elect an optional form of benefit, however the board may elect to make a lump sum payment pursuant to subsection 38-180(g).

(6)  If there is no surviving beneficiary as of the member's death, and the estate is to receive the benefits, the actuarial equivalent of the member's entire interest must be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
(7)  The uniform lifetime table in Treasury Regulations § 1.401(a)((9)-9) shall determine the payment period for the calendar year benefits commence, if necessary to satisfy the regulations. 
(Ord. No. 1337-10, § (1)7, 9-9-2010) 
Sec. 38-178. - Disability. 
(a)  Disability benefits in line of duty. Any member who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, which disability was directly caused by the performance of his duty as a police officer, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to 3.1 percent of average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service, for the first 15 years of credited service, and 3.75 percent for each year of credited service after 15 years, but in any event, the minimum amount paid to the member shall be 42 percent of the average final compensation of the member. Terminated persons, either vested or nonvested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the city for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within 30 days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(b)  In line of duty presumptions. 
(1)  Presumption. Any condition or impairment of health of a member caused by hypertension or heart disease shall be presumed to have been suffered in line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence, provided that such member shall have successfully passed a physical examination upon entering into such service, including cardiogram, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of such condition; and provided further, that such presumption shall not apply to benefits payable or granted in a policy of life insurance or disability insurance. 
(2)  Additional presumption. The presumption provided for in this subsection (2) shall apply only to those conditions described in this subsection (2) that are diagnosed on or after January 1, 1996. 
a.  Definitions. As used in this subsection (b)(2), the following definitions apply: 
1.  "Body fluids" means blood and body fluids containing visible blood and other body fluids to which universal precautions for prevention of occupational transmission of blood-borne pathogens, as established by the Centers for Disease Control, apply. For purposes of potential transmission of meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis, the term "body fluids" includes respiratory, salivary, and sinus fluids, including droplets, sputum, and saliva, mucous, and other fluids through which infectious airborne organisms can be transmitted between persons. 
2.  "Emergency rescue or public safety member" means any member employed full time by the city as a firefighter, paramedic, emergency medical technician, law enforcement officer, or correctional officer who, in the course of employment, runs a high risk of occupational exposure to hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis and who is not employed elsewhere in a similar capacity. However, the term "emergency rescue or public safety member" does not include any person employed by a public hospital licensed under F.S. Ch. 395, or any person employed by a subsidiary thereof. 
3.  "Hepatitis" means hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis non-A, hepatitis non-B, hepatitis C, or any other strain of hepatitis generally recognized by the medical community. 
4.  "High risk of occupational exposure" means that risk that is incurred because a person subject to the provisions of this subsection, in performing the basic duties associated with his employment: 
(i)  Provides emergency medical treatment in a non-health-care setting where there is a potential for transfer of body fluids between persons; 
(ii)  At the site of an accident, fire, or other rescue or public safety operation, or in an emergency rescue or public safety vehicle, handles body fluids in or out of containers or works with or otherwise handles needles or other sharp instruments exposed to body fluids; 
(iii)  Engages in the pursuit, apprehension, and arrest of law violators or suspected law violators and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids; or 
(iv)  Is responsible for the custody, and physical restraint when necessary, of prisoners or inmates within a prison, jail, or other criminal detention facility, while on work detail outside the facility, or while being transported and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids. 
5.  "Occupational exposure," in the case of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, means an exposure that occurs during the performance of job duties that may place a worker at risk of infection. 
b.  Presumption. Any emergency rescue or public safety member who suffers a condition or impairment of health that is caused by hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, that requires medical treatment, and that results in total or partial disability or death shall be presumed to have a disability suffered in the line of duty, unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence; however, in order to be entitled to the presumption, the member must, by written affidavit as provided in F.S. § 92.50, verify by written declaration that, to the best of his knowledge and belief: 
1.  In the case of a medical condition caused by or derived from hepatitis, he has not: 
i.  Been exposed, through transfer of bodily fluids, to any person known to have sickness or medical conditions derived from hepatitis, outside the scope of his employment; 
ii.  Had a transfusion of blood or blood components, other than a transfusion arising out of an accident or injury happening in connection with his present employment, or received any blood products for the treatment of a coagulation disorder since last undergoing medical tests for hepatitis, which tests failed to indicate the presence of hepatitis; 
iii.  Engaged in unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior, as identified by the Centers for Disease Control or the Surgeon General of the United States or had sexual relations with a person known to him to have engaged in such unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior; or 
iv.  Used intravenous drugs not prescribed by a physician. 
2.  In the case of meningococcal meningitis, in the ten days immediately preceding diagnosis he was not exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known to have meningococcal meningitis or known to be an asymptomatic carrier of the disease. 
3.  In the case of tuberculosis, in the period of time since the member's last negative tuberculosis skin test, he has not been exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known by him to have tuberculosis. 
c.  Immunization. Whenever any standard, medically recognized vaccine or other form of immunization or prophylaxis exists for the prevention of a communicable disease for which a presumption is granted under this section, if medically indicated in the given circumstances pursuant to immunization policies established by the advisory committee on immunization practices of the U.S. Public Health Service, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required by the city to undergo the immunization or prophylaxis unless the member's physician determines in writing that the immunization or other prophylaxis would pose a significant risk to the member's health. Absent such written declaration, failure or refusal by an emergency rescue or public safety member to undergo such immunization or prophylaxis disqualifies the member from the benefits of the presumption. 
d.  Record of exposures. The city shall maintain a record of any known or reasonably suspected exposure of an emergency rescue or public safety member in its employ to the disease described in this section and shall immediately notify the member of such exposure. An emergency rescue or public safety member shall file an incident or accident report with the city of each instance of known or suspected occupational exposure to hepatitis infection, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis. 
e.  Required medical tests; preemployment physical. In order to be entitled to the presumption provided by this section: 
1.  An emergency rescue or public safety member must, prior to diagnosis, have undergone standard, medically acceptable tests for evidence of the communicable disease for which the presumption is sought, or evidence of medical conditions derived therefrom, which tests fail to indicate the presence of infection. This subsection does not apply in the case of meningococcal meningitis. 
2.  On or after June 15, 1995, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required to undergo a preemployment physical examination that tests for and fails to reveal any evidence of hepatitis or tuberculosis. 
(c)  Disability benefits not in line of duty. Any member with ten years or more credited service who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, which disability is not directly caused by the performance of his duties as a police officer shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to 3.1 percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service for the first 15 years of credited service, and 3.75 percent for each year of credited service after 15 years. Terminated persons, either vested or nonvested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the city for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within 30 days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(d)  Conditions disqualifying disability benefits. Each member who is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
(1)  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or narcotics. 
(2)  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections or while committing a crime. 
(3)  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the armed forces. 
(4)  Injury or disease sustained by the member after his employment as a police officer with the City of Milton shall have terminated. 
(5)  Injury or disease sustained by the member while working for anyone other than the city and arising out of such employment. 
(e)  Physical examination requirement. A member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons, who shall be selected by the board for that purpose. The board shall not select the member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose except in an unusual case where the board determines that it would be reasonable and prudent to do so. 
    Any retiree receiving disability benefits under provisions of this article may be required by the board to submit sworn statements of his condition accompanied by a physician's statement (provided at the retiree's expense) to the board annually and may be required by the board to undergo additional periodic re-examinations by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons who shall be selected by the board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the board finds that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, the board shall recommend to the city that the retiree be returned to performance of duty as a police officer, and the retiree so returned shall enjoy the same rights that he had at the time he was placed upon pension. In the event the retiree so ordered to return shall refuse to comply with the order within 30 days from the issuance thereof, he shall forfeit the right to his pension. 
    The cost of the physical examination and/or re-examination of the member claiming or the retiree receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by the board incident to the physical examination, such as, but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the fund. 
    If the retiree recovers from disability and reenters the service of the city as a police officer, his service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he reentered the service of the city will not be considered as credited service for the purposes of the system. 
    The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability claims. 
(f)  Disability payments. The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled in the event of the member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be: 
(1)  If the retiree recovers from the disability, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery, or 
(2)  If the retiree dies without recovering from disability, the payment due next preceding his death or the 120th monthly payment, whichever is later. 
    Provided, however, the disability retiree may select, at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in section 38-180, subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2), which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit. 
(g)  Workers' compensation. When a retiree is receiving a disability pension and workers' compensation benefits pursuant to F.S. Ch. 440, for the same disability, and the total monthly benefits received from both exceed 100 percent of the member's average monthly wage, as defined in F.S. Ch. 440, the disability pension benefit shall be reduced so that the total monthly amount received by the retiree does not exceed 100 percent of such average monthly wage. The amount of any lump sum workers' compensation payment shall be converted to an equivalent monthly benefit payable for ten years certain by dividing the lump sum amount by 83.9692. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the disability pension benefit be reduced below the greater of 42 percent of average final compensation or two percent of average final compensation times years of credited service. 
(Ord. No. 1337-10, § (1)8, 9-9-2010; Ord. No. 1412-14 , § 3, 8-12-2014) 
Sec. 38-179. - Vesting. 
    If a member terminates his employment as a police officer, either voluntarily or by discharge, and is not eligible for any other benefits under this system, the member shall be entitled to the following: 
1.  If the member has less than six years credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a refund of his accumulated contributions or the member may leave it deposited with the fund. 
2.  If the member has six or more years of credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to the pension benefit accrued to his date of termination based upon the member's credited service, average final compensation and the benefit accrual rate as of the date of termination, payable to him for life with 120 payments guaranteed commencing at age 55 or reduced three percent per year from age 55 commencing as early as age 50, provided he does not elect to withdraw his accumulated contributions and provided the member survives until payments actually begin. If the member does not withdraw his accumulated contributions and does not survive until payments actually begin, his designated beneficiary shall be entitled to a benefit as provided herein for a deceased member, vested or eligible for retirement under preretirement death. 
(Ord. No. 1337-10, § (1)9, 9-9-2010) 
Sec. 38-180. - Optional forms of benefits. 
(a)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early retirement as specified herein, a member, upon written request to the board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one of the following options: 
(1)  A retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the retiree for his lifetime only. 
(2)  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the retiree during the lifetime of the retiree and following the death of the retiree, 100 percent, 75 percent, 66 2/3 percent or 50 percent of such monthly amount payable to a joint pensioner for his lifetime. Except where the retiree's joint pensioner is his spouse, the payments to the joint pensioner as a percentage of the payments to the retiree shall not exceed the applicable percentage provided for in the applicable table in the Treasury Regulations (See Q & A-2 of 1.401(a)(9)-6). 
(3)  If a member retires prior to the time at which Social Security benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as Social Security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the system, based upon the Social Security law in effect at the time of the member's retirement. 
(b)  The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner (subsection (a)(2) above) or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system in the event of member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. A member may change his beneficiary at any time. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner and member's retirement income benefits have commenced, member may thereafter change his designated beneficiary at any time, but may only change his joint pensioner twice. Subject to the restriction in the previous sentence, a member may substitute a new joint pensioner for a deceased joint pensioner. In the absence of proof of good health of the joint pensioner being replaced, the actuary will assume that the joint pensioner has deceased for purposes of calculating the new payment. 
(c)  The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously-designated beneficiaries to receive benefits under the system shall thereupon cease. 
(d)  Upon change of a retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this section, the amount of the retirement income payable to the retiree shall be actuarially redetermined to take into account the age of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the retiree and to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the retiree's then-current benefit at the time of the change. Any such retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board and on completion will be filed with the board. In the event that no designated beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the retiree subsequent to his retirement shall be paid as provided in section 38-181. 
(e)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(1)  If a member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under section 38-177. 
(2)  If the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the member's retirement under the system, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his retirement. 
(3)  If both the retiree and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by member or retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a), the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with section 38-181. 
(4)  If a member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of subsection 38-176(a), and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the member in the amount or amounts computed as if the member had retired under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
(5)  The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 701/2 or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(f)  A retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
(g)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the board in its discretion, may elect to make a lump sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the total commuted value of the monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed $1,000.00. Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to such member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(Ord. No. 1337-10, § (1)10, 9-9-2010) 
Sec. 38-181. - Beneficiaries. 
(a)  Each member or retiree may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the board, designate a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the event of his death. Each designation may be revoked or changed by such member or retiree by signing and filing with the board a new designation-of-beneficiary form. Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the system shall cease. 
(b)  If a deceased member or retiree failed to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection (a); or if the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) named by a deceased member or retiree predeceases the member or retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the system with respect to such deceased member or retiree, shall be paid to the estate of the member or retiree and the board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum. 
(c)  Any payment made to any person pursuant to this section shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to the deceased member and any other persons with rights under the system and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 1337-10, § (1)11, 9-9-2010) 
Sec. 38-182. - Claims procedures. 
(a)  The board shall establish administrative claims procedures to be utilized in processing written requests ("claims"), on matters which affect the substantial rights of any person ("claimant"), including members, retirees, beneficiaries, or any person affected by a decision of the board. 
(b)  The board shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents for discovery prior to and at any proceedings provided for in the board's claims procedures. The claimant may request in writing the issuance of subpoenas by the board. A reasonable fee may be charged for the issuance of any subpoenas not to exceed the fees set forth in Florida Statutes. 
(Ord. No. 1337-10, § (1)12, 9-9-2010) 
Sec. 38-183. - Reports to division of retirement. 
    Each year and no later than March 15th, the board shall file an annual report with the division of retirement containing the documents and information required by F.S. § 185.221. 
(Ord. No. 1337-10, § (1)13, 9-9-2010) 
Sec. 38-184. - Roster of retirees. 
    The secretary of the board shall keep a record of all persons enjoying a pension under the provisions of this article in which it shall be noted the time when the pension is allowed and when the same shall cease to be paid. Additionally, the secretary shall keep a record of all members in such a manner as to show the name, address, date of employment and date of termination of employment. 
(Ord. No. 1337-10, § (1)14, 9-9-2010) 
Sec. 38-185. - Maximum pension. 
(a)  Basic limitation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this system to the contrary, the member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the system shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of Code Section 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in Code Section 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in Code Section 415(b)(1)(A), $160,000.00, subject to the applicable adjustments in Code Section 415(b) and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this system. For purposes of this section, "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
    For purposes of Code Section 415(b), the "annual benefit" means a benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) without regard to the benefit attributable to after-tax employee contributions (except pursuant to Code Section 415(n) and to rollover contributions (as defined in Code Section 415(b)(2)(A)). The "benefit attributable" shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations. 
(b)  Adjustments to basic limitation for form of benefit. If the benefit under the plan is other than the annual benefit described in subsection (a), then the benefit shall be adjusted so that it is the equivalent of the annual benefit, using factors prescribed in Treasury Regulations. If the form of the benefit without regard to any automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity or a qualified joint and survivor annuity, then the preceding sentence is applied by either reducing the Code Section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date or adjusting the form of benefit to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the additional benefits under the form of benefit as follows: 
(1)  For a benefit paid in a form to which Section 417(e)(3) of the Code does not apply (generally, a monthly benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greater of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit to the member; or 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the member, computed using a five percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Rulings 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code); or 
(2)  For a benefit paid in a form to which Section 417(e)(3) of the Code applies (generally, a lump sum benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greatest of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in the plan for actuarial experience; 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using a 5.5 percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code); or 
c.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable (computed using the applicable interest rate for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) (the 30-year treasury rate (prior to January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the month prior to retirement, and on and after January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the first day of the plan year with a one-year stabilization period)) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing Section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code), divided by 1.05. 
(3)  The actuary may adjust the Section 415(b) limit at the annuity starting date in accordance with subsections (1) and (2) above. 
(c)  Benefits not taken into account. For purposes of this section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
(1)  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
(2)  Any other benefit not required under Section 415(b)(2) of the Code and regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of Code Section 415(b)(1); and 
(3)  That portion of any joint and survivor annuity that constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity. 
(d)  COLA effect. Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b) (the "limit"), the following will apply: 
(1)  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first limitation year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
(2)  Thereafter, in any subsequent limitation year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under Code Section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
(3)  In no event shall a member's benefit payable under the system in any limitation year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code Section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
    Unless otherwise specified in the system, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b), a member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost-of-living increases as required by Section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable Treasury Regulations. 
(e)  Other adjustments in limitations. 
(1)  In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age 62, the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of Section 415(b) of the Code, so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a $160,000.00 annual benefit beginning at age 62. 
(2)  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least 15 years of credited service as a full-time employee of the police or fire department of the city, the adjustments provided for in subsection (e)(1) above shall not apply. 
(3)  The reductions provided for in subsection (e)(1) above shall not be applicable to disability benefits pursuant to section 38-178, or preretirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 38-177. 
(4)  In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age 65, for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (a) herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age 65. This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. 
(f)  Less than ten years of participation or service. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any member who has completed less than ten years of credited service with the city shall be the amount determined under subsection (a) of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten. The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below ten percent of the limit determined without regard to this subsection. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to pre-retirement disability benefits paid pursuant to section 38-178, or preretirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 38-177. 
(g)  Participation in other defined benefit plans. The limit of this section with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in Code Section 414(j) maintained by the city shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all city defined benefits plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one plan. 
(h)  Ten thousand dollar limit; less than ten years of service. Notwithstanding anything in this section 38-185, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this subsection (h) of section 38-185 if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this system and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the city contributes, do not exceed $10,000.00 for the applicable limitation year and for any prior limitation year and the city has not any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated; provided, however, that if the member has completed less than ten years of credited service with the city, the limit under this subsection (h) of section 38-185 shall be a reduced limit equal to $10,000.00 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten. 
(i)  Reduction of benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(j)  Service credit purchase limits. 
(1)  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a member makes one or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the system, as allowed in sections 38-196 and 38-197, then the requirements of this section will be treated as met only if: 
a.  The requirements of Code Section 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of Code Section 415(b); or 
b.  The requirements of Code Section 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of Code Section 415(c). 
For purposes of applying subsection (j)(1)a., the system will not fail to meet the reduced limit under Code Section 415(b)(2)(c) solely by reason of this subsection, and for purposes of applying subsection b. the system will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under Section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code solely by reason of this subsection. 
(2)  For purposes of this subsection the term "permissive service credit" means service credit: 
a.  Recognized by the system for purposes of calculating a member's benefit under the plan; 
b.  Which such member has not received under the plan; and 
c.  Which such member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the system, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
    Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the system, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding clause (j)(2)b., may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a member is receiving under the system. 
(k)  Contribution limits. 
(1)  For purposes of applying the Code Section 415(c) limits which are incorporated by reference and for purposes of this subsection (k), only and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable will be compensation actually paid or made available during a limitation year, except as noted below and as permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the system, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of Code Section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under Code Sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052 and will be determined without regard to any rules under Code Section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code Section 3401(a)(2)). 
a.  However, for limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under Code Sections 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b). For limitation years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of Code Section 132(f)(4). 
b.  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the limitation year will also include compensation paid by the later of 21/2 months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
1.  The payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
2.  The payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
c.  Back pay, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this definition. 
(2)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the board may modify a request by a member to make a contribution to the system if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in Code Section 415 by using the following methods: 
a.  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the board may establish a periodic payment deduction plan for the member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under Code Sections 415(c) or 415(n). 
b.  If payment pursuant to subsection (k)(2)a. will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by Code Section 415(c), the board may either reduce the member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the member's contribution. 
(3)  If the annual additions for any member for a limitation year exceed the limitation under Section 415(c) of the Code, the excess annual addition will be corrected as permitted under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (or similar IRS correction program). 
(4)  For limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, a member's compensation for purposes of this subsection (k) shall not exceed the annual limit under Section 401(a)(17) of the Code. 
(l)  Additional limitation on pension benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
(1)  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of the system and who has not previously participated in such system, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed 100 percent of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
(2)  No member of the system shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to Social Security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 67, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
(Ord. No. 1337-10, § (1)15, 9-9-2010; Ord. No. 1400-13 , § 1, 10-8-2013) 
Sec. 38-186. - Minimum distribution of benefits. 
(a)  General rules. 
(1)  Effective date. Effective as of January 1, 1989, the plan will pay all benefits in accordance with a good faith interpretation of the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations in effect under that section, as applicable to a governmental plan within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 414(d).

(2)  Death of member before distributions begin. If the member dies before distributions begin, the member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than as follows: 
a.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age 701/2, if later, as the surviving spouse elects. 
b.  If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's sole designated beneficiary, then, distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. 
c.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death, the member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
d.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection (b)(2), other than subsection (b)(2)a., will apply as if the surviving spouse were the member. 
For purposes of this subsection (b)(2), distributions are considered to begin on the member's required beginning date or, if subsection (b)(2)d. applies, the date of distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required beginning date (or to the member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a.), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(3)  Death after distributions begin. If the member dies after the required distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the member's interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution before the member's death. 
(4)  Form of distribution. Unless the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance of with this section. If the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury Regulations. Any part of the member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in Section 414(k) of the Code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury Regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(c)  Determination of amount to be distributed each year.

The member's entire interest must be distributed pursuant to section 38-176, section 38-177, section 38-179, or section 38-180 (as applicable) and in any event over a period equal to or less than the member's life or the lives of the member and a designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the member or of the member and a designated beneficiary. The life expectancy of the member, the member's spouse, or the member's beneficiary may not be recalculated after the initial determination for purposes of determining benefits. 
(2)  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the member's required beginning date (or, if the member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under section 38-177) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., monthly. All of the member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member's required beginning date. 
(3)  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
(d)  General distribution rules. 
(1)  The amount of an annuity paid to a member's beneficiary may not exceed the maximum determined under the incidental death benefit requirement of Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9)(G), and effective for any annuity commencing on or after January 1, 2008, the minimum distribution incidental benefit rule under Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(a)(9)-6, Q&A-2. 
(2)  The death and disability benefits provided by the plan are limited by the incidental benefit rule set forth in Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9)(G) and Treasury Regulation Section 1.401-1(b)(1)(I) or any successor regulation thereto. As a result, the total death or disability benefits payable may not exceed 25 percent of the cost for all of the members' benefits received from the retirement system. 
(e)  Definitions. 
(1)  Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and is the designated beneficiary under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4, of the Treasury regulations. 
(2)  Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the member's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to section 38-177.

Sec. 38-187. - Miscellaneous provisions. 
(a)  Interest of members in system. All assets of the fund are held in trust, and at no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the system with respect to retirees and members and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall any part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit.

Any modification or amendment of the system may be made retroactively, if necessary or appropriate, to qualify or maintain the system as a plan meeting the requirements of the applicable provisions of the Code as now in effect or hereafter amended, or any other applicable provisions of the U.S. federal tax laws, as now in effect or hereafter amended or adopted, and the regulations issued thereunder. 
(d)  Use of forfeitures. Forfeitures arising from terminations of service of members shall serve only to reduce future city contributions.

To the extent that the definition of "Credited Service" sets forth contribution requirements that are more favorable to the member than the minimum compliance requirements, the more favorable provisions shall apply. 
(g)  Vesting. 
(1)  Member will be 100 percent vested in all benefits upon attainment of the plan's age and service requirements for the plan's normal retirement benefit; and 
(2)  A member will be 100 percent vested in all accrued benefits, to the extent funded, if the plan is terminated or experiences a complete discontinuance of employer contributions. 
(h)  Electronic forms. In those circumstances where a written election or consent is not required by the plan or the Internal Revenue Code, an oral, electronic, or telephonic form in lieu of or in addition to a written form may be prescribed by the board. However, where applicable, the board shall comply with Treasury Regulations § 1.401(a)-21. 
(i)  Compliance with F.S. Ch. 185. It is intended that the system will continue to qualify for funding under F.S. § 185.08. Accordingly, unless otherwise required by law, any provision of the system which violates the requirements of F.S. Ch. 185, as amended from time to time, shall be superseded by and administered in accordance with the requirements of such chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1337-10, § (1)17, 9-9-2010) 
Sec. 38-188. - Repeal or termination of system. 
(a)  This article establishing the system and fund, and subsequent ordinances pertaining to said system and fund, may be modified, terminated, or amended, in whole or in part; provided that if this or any subsequent ordinance shall be amended or repealed in its application to any person benefitting hereunder, the amount of benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment, or repeal shall have accrued to the member or beneficiary shall not be affected thereby. 
(b)  If this article shall be repealed, or if contributions to the system are discontinued or if there is a transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions as provided in F.S. Ch. 121, the board shall continue to administer the system in accordance with the provisions of this article, for the sole benefit of the then members, any beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one of the options provided for in this article who are designated by any of said members. In the event of repeal, discontinuance of contributions, or transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions, there shall be full vesting (100 percent) of benefits accrued to date of repeal and such benefits shall be nonforfeitable. 
(c)  The fund shall be distributed in accordance with the following procedures: 
(1)  The board shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value required to fund all the nonforfeitable benefits after taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The board shall inform the city if additional assets are required, in which event the city shall continue to financially support the plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded. 
(2)  The board shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or otherwise, for each police officer entitled to benefits under the plan as specified in subsection (c)(3). 
(3)  The board shall distribute the asset value as of the date of termination in the manner set forth in this subsection, on the basis that the amount required to provide any given retirement income is the actuarially computed single-sum value of such retirement income, except that if the method of distribution determined under subsection (c)(2) involves the purchase of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given retirement income is the single premium payable for such annuity. The actuarial single-sum value may not be less than the police officer's accumulated contributions to the plan, with interest if provided by the plan, less the value of any plan benefits previously paid to the police officer. 
(4)  If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection (c)(3), and after the payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the city, less return to the state of the state's contributions, provided that, if the excess is less than the total contributions made by the city and the state to date of termination of the plan, such excess shall be divided proportionately to the total contributions made by the city and the state. 
(5)  The board shall distribute, in accordance with subsection (c)(2), the amounts determined under subsection (c)(3). 
    If, after 24 months after the date the plan terminated or the date the board received written notice that the contributions thereunder were being permanently discontinued, the city or the board of the fund affected has not complied with all the provisions in this section, the Florida Department of Management Services will effect the termination of the fund in accordance with this section.

Ch. 185 and to make any payments for child support or alimony.

Sec. 38-194. - Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions; elimination of mandatory distributions. 
(a)  Rollover distributions. 
(1)  General. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the system to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions. 
a.  Eligible rollover distribution: An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income. Effective January 1, 2002, any portion of any distribution which would be includible in gross income as after-tax employee contributions will be an eligible rollover distribution if the distribution is made to an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a); to an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b); to a qualified defined contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible; or on or after January 1, 2007, to a qualified defined benefit plan described in Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a) or to an annuity contract described in Internal Revenue Code Section 403(b), that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not so includible.

This definition shall apply in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse. 
c.  Distributee: A distributee includes an employee or former employee. It also includes, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse. Effective January 1, 2007, it further includes a nonspouse beneficiary who is a designated beneficiary as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9)(E). However, a nonspouse beneficiary may rollover the distribution only to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving the distribution and the account or annuity will be treated as an "inherited" individual retirement account or annuity. 
d.  Direct rollover: A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(b)  Rollovers or transfers into the fund. On or after January 1, 2002, the system will accept, solely for the purpose of purchasing credited service as provided herein, permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans, member rollover cash contributions and/or direct cash rollovers of distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, as follows: 
(1)  Transfers and direct rollovers or member rollover contributions from other plans.

The system will also accept legally permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans. 
(2)  Member rollover contributions from IRAs. The system will accept a member rollover contribution of the portion of a distribution from an individual retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or 408(b) of the Code that is eligible to be rolled over 
(c)  Elimination of mandatory distributions. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event this plan provides for a mandatory (involuntary) cash distribution from the plan not otherwise required by law, for an amount in excess of $1,000.00, such distribution shall be made from the plan only upon written request of the member and completion by the member of a written election on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount.

As of the first day of each month of a member's period of participation in the DROP, the monthly retirement benefit he would have received under the system had he terminated his employment as a police officer and elected to receive monthly benefit payments thereunder shall be transferred to his DROP account, except as otherwise provided for in subsection (b)(4)b. A member's period of participation in the DROP shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of subsections (b)(3) and (b)(4), but in no event shall it continue past the date he terminates his employment as a police officer. 
b.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b)(4)b., a member's DROP account under this subsection (c)(2): 
1.  For DROP participation in years one through five, the account shall be debited or credited with either: 
(i)  Interest at an effective rate of six and one-half percent per annum compounded monthly determined on the last business day of the prior month's ending balance and credited to the member's DROP account as of such date (to be applicable to all current and future DROP participants); or 
(ii)  Earnings, to be credited or debited to the member's DROP account, determined as of the last business day of each fiscal year quarter and debited or credited as of such date, determined as follows: 
The average daily balance in a member's DROP account shall be credited or debited at a rate equal to the net investment return realized by the system for that quarter. "Net investment return" for the purpose of this subsection is the total return of the assets in which the member's DROP account is invested by the board net of brokerage commissions, transaction costs and management fees. 
For purposes of calculating earnings on a member's DROP account pursuant to this subsection (c)(2)b.2., brokerage commissions, transaction costs, and management fees shall be determined for each quarter by the investment consultant pursuant to contracts with fund managers as reported in the custodial statement. The investment consultant shall report these quarterly contractual fees to the board. The investment consultant shall also report the net investment return for each manager and the net investment return for the total plan assets. 
Upon electing participation in the DROP, the member shall elect to receive either interest or earnings on his account to be determined as provided above. The member may, in writing, elect to change his election only once during his DROP participation. An election to change must be made prior to the end of a quarter and shall be effective beginning the following quarter. 
2.  For DROP participation in years six and seven, the account shall be credited with earnings, to be credited to the member's DROP account, determined as of the last business day of each fiscal year quarter and credited as of such date, determined as follows: 
The average daily balance in a member's DROP account shall be credited at a rate equal to the net investment return realized by the system for that quarter, but not less than zero percent and not greater than six and five-tenths percent. "Net investment return" for the purpose of this subsection is the total return of the assets in which the member's DROP account is invested by the board net of brokerage commissions, transaction costs and management fees. 
For purposes of calculating earnings on a member's DROP account pursuant to this subsection (c)(2)b.2., brokerage commissions, transaction costs, and management tees shall be determined for each quarter by the investment consultant pursuant to contracts with fund managers as reported in the custodial statement. The investment consultant shall report these quarterly contractual fees to the board. The investment consultant shall also report the net investment return for each manager and the net investment return for the total plan assets. 
c.  A member's DROP account shall only be credited or debited with earnings or interest and monthly benefits while the member is a participant in the DROP. A member's final DROP account value for distribution to the member upon termination of participation in the DROP shall be the value of the account at the end of the quarter immediately preceding termination of participation plus any monthly periodic additions made to the DROP account subsequent to the end of the previous quarter and prior to distribution. If a member is employed by the police department after participating in the DROP for the permissible period of DROP participation, then beginning with the member's 1st month of employment following the last month of the permissible period of DROP participation, the member's DROP account will no longer be credited or debited with earnings or interest, nor will monthly benefits be transferred to the DROP account. All such non-transferred amounts shall be forfeited and continue to be forfeited while the member is employed by the police department. A member employed by the police department after the permissible period of DROP participation will still not be eligible for preretirement death or disability benefits, nor will he accrue additional credited service, except as provided for in section 38-199. 
(d)  Distribution of DROP accounts on termination of employment. 
(1)  Eligibility for benefits. A member shall receive the balance in his DROP account in accordance with the provisions of this subsection (d) upon his termination of employment as a police officer. Except as provided in subsection (d)(5), no amounts shall be paid to a member from the DROP prior to his termination of employment as a police officer. 
(2)  Form of distribution. 
a.  Unless the member elects otherwise, distribution of his DROP account shall be made in a cash lump sum, subject to the direct rollover provisions set forth in subsection (d)(6). Elections under this subsection shall be in writing and shall be made in such time or manner as the board shall determine. 
b.  If a member dies before his benefit is paid, his DROP account shall be paid to his beneficiary in such optional form as his beneficiary may select. If no beneficiary designation is made, the DROP account shall be distributed to the member's estate. 
(3)  Date of payment of distribution. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (d), distribution of a member's DROP account shall be made as soon as administratively practicable following the member's termination of employment. 
(4)  Proof of death and right of beneficiary or other person. The board may require and rely upon such proof of death and such evidence of the right of any beneficiary or other person to receive the value of a deceased member's DROP account as the board may deem proper and its determination of the right of that beneficiary or other person to receive payment shall be conclusive. 
(5)  Distribution limitation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection (d), all distributions from the DROP shall conform to the "minimum distribution of benefits" provisions as provided for herein. 
(6)  Direct rollover of certain distributions. This subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the DROP to the contrary, a distributee may elect to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid in a direct rollover as otherwise provided under the system in section 38-194. 
(e)  Administration of DROP. 
(1)  Board administers the DROP. The general administration of the DROP, the responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the DROP and the responsibility of overseeing the investment of the DROP's assets shall be placed in the board. The members of the board may appoint from their number such subcommittees with such powers as they shall determine; may adopt such administrative procedures and regulations as they deem desirable for the conduct of their affairs; may authorize one or more of their number or any agent to execute or deliver any instrument or make any payment on their behalf; may retain counsel, employ agents and provide for such clerical, accounting, actuarial and consulting services as they may require in carrying out the provisions of the DROP; and may allocate among themselves or delegate to other persons all or such portion of their duties under the DROP, other than those granted to them as trustee under any trust agreement adopted for use in implementing the DROP, as they, in their sole discretion, shall decide. A trustee shall not vote on any question relating exclusively to himself. 
(2)  Individual accounts, records and reports. The board shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, records showing the operation and condition of the DROP, including records showing the individual balances in each member's DROP account, and the board shall keep, or cause to be kept, in convenient form such data as may be necessary for the valuation of the assets and liabilities of the DROP. The board shall prepare or cause to be prepared and distributed to members participating in the DROP and other individuals or filed with the appropriate governmental agencies, as the case may be, all necessary descriptions, reports, information returns, and data required to be distributed or filed for the DROP pursuant to the Code and any other applicable laws. 
(3)  Establishment of rules. Subject to the limitations of the DROP, the board from time to time shall establish rules for the administration of the DROP and the transaction of its business. The board shall have discretionary authority to construe and interpret the DROP (including but not limited to determination of an individual's eligibility for DROP participation, the right and amount of any benefit payable under the DROP and the date on which any individual ceases to be a participant in the DROP). The determination of the board as to the interpretation of the DROP or its determination of any disputed questions shall be conclusive and final to the extent permitted by applicable law. The board shall also oversee the investment of the DROP's assets. 
(4)  Limitation of liability. 
a.  The trustees shall not incur any liability individually or on behalf of any other individuals for any act or failure to act, made in good faith in relation to the DROP or the funds of the DROP. 
b.  Neither the board nor any trustee of the board shall be responsible for any reports furnished by any expert retained or employed by the board, but they shall be entitled to rely thereon as well as on certificates furnished by an accountant or an actuary, and on all opinions of counsel. The board shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in reliance upon such expert, accountant, actuary or counsel, and all actions taken or suffered in such reliance shall be conclusive upon any person with any interest in the DROP. 
(f)  General provisions. 
(1)  Amendment of DROP. The DROP may be amended by an ordinance of the city at any time and from time to time, and retroactively if deemed necessary or appropriate, to amend in whole or in part any or all of the provisions of the DROP. However, except as otherwise provided by law, no amendment shall make it possible for any part of the DROP's funds to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of persons entitled to benefits under the DROP. No amendment shall be made which has the effect of decreasing the balance of the DROP account of any member. 
(2)  Facility of payment. If the board shall find that a member or other person entitled to a benefit under the DROP is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident or is a minor, the board may direct that any benefit due him, unless claim shall have been made for the benefit by a duly appointed legal representative, be paid to his spouse, a child, a parent or other blood relative, or to a person with whom he resides. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of the liabilities of the DROP for that benefit. 
(3)  Information. Each member, beneficiary or other person entitled to a benefit, before any benefit shall be payable to him or on his account under the DROP, shall file with the board the information that it shall require to establish his rights and benefits under the DROP. 
(4)  Prevention of escheat. If the board cannot ascertain the whereabouts of any person to whom a payment is due under the DROP, the board may, no earlier than three years from the date such payment is due, mail a notice of such due and owing payment to the last known address of such person, as shown on the records of the board or the city. If such person has not made written claim therefor within three months of the date of the mailing, the board may, if it so elects and upon receiving advice from counsel to the DROP, direct that such payment and all remaining payments otherwise due such person be canceled on the records of the DROP. Upon such cancellation, the DROP shall have no further liability therefor except that, in the event such person or his beneficiary later notifies the board of his whereabouts and requests the payment or payments due to him under the DROP, the amount so applied shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of the DROP. 
(5)  Written elections, notification. 
a.  Any elections, notifications or designations made by a member pursuant to the provisions of the DROP shall be made in writing and filed with the board in a time and manner determined by the board under rules uniformly applicable to all employees similarly situated. The board reserves the right to change from time to time the manner for making notifications, elections or designations by members under the DROP if it determines after due deliberation that such action is justified in that it improves the administration of the DROP. In the event of a conflict between the provisions for making an election, notification or designation set forth in the DROP and such new administrative procedures, those new administrative procedures shall prevail. 
b.  Each member or retiree who has a DROP account shall be responsible for furnishing the board with his current address and any subsequent changes in his address. Any notice required to be given to a member or retiree hereunder shall be deemed given if directed to him at the last such address given to the board and mailed by registered or certified United States mail. If any check mailed by registered or certified United States mail to such address is returned, mailing of checks will be suspended until such time as the member or retiree notifies the board of his address. 
(6)  Benefits not guaranteed. All benefits payable to a member from the DROP shall be paid only from the assets of the member's DROP account and neither the city nor the board shall have any duty or liability to furnish the DROP with any funds, securities or other assets except to the extent required by any applicable law. 
(7)  Construction. 
a.  The DROP shall be construed, regulated and administered under the laws of Florida, except where other applicable law controls. 
b.  The titles and headings of the subsections in this section 38-198 are for convenience only. In the case of ambiguity or inconsistency, the text rather than the titles or headings shall control. 
(8)  Forfeiture of retirement benefits. Nothing in this section shall be construed to remove DROP participants from the application of any forfeiture provisions applicable to the system. DROP participants shall be subject to forfeiture of all retirement benefits, including DROP benefits. 
(9)  Effect of DROP participation on employment. Participation in the DROP is not a guarantee of employment and DROP participants shall be subject to the same employment standards and policies that are applicable to employees who are not DROP participants.

Sec. 38-199. - Reemployment after retirement. 
(a)  Any retiree who is retired under this system, except for disability retirement as previously provided for, may be reemployed by any public or private employer, except the city, and may receive compensation from that employment without limiting or restricting in any way the retirement benefits payable under this system. Reemployment by the city shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this section. 
(b)  After normal retirement. Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed as a police officer after that retirement and, by virtue of that reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, shall upon being reemployed discontinue receipt of benefits. Upon reemployment, the retiree shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional credited service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final retirement. Calculations of benefits upon retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation, and credited service as of that date and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation (based only on the subsequent employment period), and credited service as of the date of subsequent retirement The amount of any death or disability benefit received as a result of a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the member may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable to the subsequent retirement benefit. 
(c)  Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed by the city after that retirement and, by virtue of that reemployment is ineligible to participate in this system, shall, during the period of such reemployment, discontinue receipt of benefits during any subsequent employment period. 
(d)  After early retirement. Any retiree who is retired under early retirement pursuant to this system and who subsequently becomes an employee of the city in any capacity shall discontinue receipt of benefits from the system. If by virtue of that reemployment, the retiree is eligible to participate in this system, the retiree shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional credited service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final retirement. Calculations of benefits upon retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation, credited service and early retirement reduction factor as of that date and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation (based only on the subsequent employment period), and credited service as of the date of subsequent retirement The amount of any death or disability benefit received as a result of a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the member may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable to the subsequent retirement benefit. Retirement pursuant to an early retirement incentive program shall be deemed early retirement for purposes of this section if the member was permitted to retire prior to the customary retirement date provided for in the system at the time of retirement. 
(e)  Reemployment of terminated vested persons. Reemployed terminated vested persons shall not be subject to the provisions of this section until such time as they begin to actually receive benefits. Upon receipt of benefits, terminated vested persons shall be treated as normal or early retirees for purposes of applying the provisions of this section and their status as an early or normal retiree shall be determined by the date they elect to begin to receive their benefit. 
(f)  DROP participants. Members or retirees who are or were in the deferred retirement option plan shall, following termination of employment after DROP participation, have the options provided for in this section for reemployment.

    Average final compensation means 1/12 of the average salary of the highest five best years of the last ten years of credited service prior to retirement, termination, or death, or the career average as a fulltime firefighter whichever is greater. A year shall be 12 consecutive months. 
    Beneficiary means the person entitled to receive benefits under this article at the death of a member who has been designated in writing by the member and filed with the board.

    Credited service means the total number of years and fractional parts of years of service as a firefighter with member contributions, when required, omitting intervening years or fractional parts of years when such member was not employed by the city as a firefighter. A member may voluntarily leave his accumulated contributions in the fund for a period of five years after leaving the employ of the fire department pending the possibility of being reemployed as a firefighter, without losing credit for the time that he was a member of the system. If a vested member leaves the employ of the fire department, his accumulated contributions will be returned only upon his written request. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed as a firefighter with the fire department within five years, his accumulated contributions shall be returned. Upon return of a member's accumulated contributions, all of his rights and benefits under the system are forfeited and terminated. Upon any reemployment, a firefighter shall not receive credit for the years and fractional parts of years of service for which he has withdrawn his accumulated contributions from the fund, unless the firefighter repays into the fund the contributions he has withdrawn, with interest, as determined by the board of trustees within 90 days after his reemployment. The years or fractional parts of a year that a member serves in the military service of the Armed Forces of the United States, the United States Merchant Marine or the United States Coast Guard, voluntarily or involuntarily, after separation from employment as a firefighter with the city to perform training or service, shall be added to his years of credited service for all purposes, including vesting; provided that: 
(1)  The member must return to his employment as a firefighter within one year from the earlier of the date of his military discharge or his release from active service. 
(2)  The member is entitled to reemployment under the provisions of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) (PL 103-353). 
(3)  The maximum credit for military service pursuant to this definition shall be five years. 
    Effective date means March 10, 1998. 
    Firefighter means an actively employed fulltime person employed by the city, including his initial probationary employment period, who is certified as a firefighter as a condition of employment in accordance with the provisions of F.S. § 633.35, and whose duty it is to extinguish fires to protect life and to protect property. 
    Fund means the trust fund established in this article as part of the system. 
    Member means an actively employed firefighter who fulfills the prescribed membership requirements. Benefit improvements which, in the past, have been provided for by amendments to the system adopted by city ordinance and any benefit improvements which might be made in the future shall apply prospectively and shall not apply to members who terminate employment or who retire prior to the effective date of any ordinance adopting such benefit improvements, unless such ordinance specifically provides to the contrary. 
    Plan year means the 12-month period beginning October 1 and ending September 30 of the following year. 
    Retiree means a member who has entered retirement status. 
    Retirement means a member's separation from city employment with eligibility for immediate receipt of benefits under the system. 
    Salary means the total compensation for services rendered to the city as a firefighter reportable on the member's W-2 form, plus all tax deferred, tax sheltered or tax exempt items of income derived from elective employee payroll deductions or salary reductions, plus sick leave redemptions and holiday pay. However, salary shall exclude all lump sum vacation pay, sick-leave pay, and any other non-regular payments. Compensation for any plan year shall not exceed the annual compensation limit under section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as in effect on the first day of the plan year. This limit shall be adjusted by the Secretary of the Treasury to reflect increases in the cost of living, as provided in section 401(a)(17)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; provided, however, that the dollar increase in effect on January 1 of any calendar year is effective for plan year beginning in such calendar year. If a system determines compensation over a plan year that contains fewer than 12 calendar months (a "short plan year"), then the compensation limit for such "short plan year" is equal to the compensation limit for the calendar year in which the "short plan year" begins multiplied by the ratio obtained by dividing the number of full months in the "short plan year." 
    Spouse means the lawful wife or husband of a member or retiree at the time benefits become payable. 
    System means the municipal firefighters' pension trust fund as contained in this article and all amendments thereto.

Sec. 38-353. - Disability. 
(a)  Benefits for disability incurred in line of duty. Any member who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, which disability was directly caused by the performance of his duty as a firefighter, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to 3.85 percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service, but in any event, the minimum amount paid to the member shall be 42 percent of the average final compensation of the member. A member may select an actuarially equivalent joint and survivor benefit as provided for in section 38-355(a)(2). Terminated persons, either vested or nonvested, are not eligible for disability benefits. 
(b)  Presumptions. The in the line presumptions are as follows: 
(1)  Hypertension; heart disease. Any condition or impairment of the health of a member caused by hypertension or heart disease shall be presumed to have been suffered in the line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence; provided that such member shall have successfully passed a physical examination upon entering into such service, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of such condition and; provided further that such a presumption shall not apply to benefits payable or granted in a policy of life insurance or disability insurance. 
(2)  Additional presumption. The presumption provided for in subsection (b)(2) of this section shall apply only to those conditions described in subsection (b)(2) of this section that are diagnosed on or after January 1, 1996. 
a.  Definitions. As used in this subsection (b)(2)a. of this section, the following definitions apply: 
    Body fluids means: 
(1)  Blood and body fluids containing visible blood and other body fluids to which universal precautions for the prevention of occupational transmission of blood-borne pathogens, as established by the Centers for Disease Control, apply. 
(2)  For purposes of potential transmission of meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis, the term "body fluids" includes respiratory, salivary, and sinus fluids, including droplets, sputum, and saliva, mucous, and other fluids through which infectious airborne organisms can be transmitted between persons. 
    Emergency rescue or public safety member. 
(1)  The term "emergency rescue or public safety member" means any member employed fulltime by the city as a firefighter, paramedic, emergency medical technician, law enforcement officer, or correctional officer who, in the course of employment, runs a high risk of occupational exposure to hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis and who is not employed elsewhere in a similar capacity. 
(2)  The term "emergency rescue or public safety member" does not include any person employed by a public hospital licensed under F.S. Ch. 395, or any person employed by a subsidiary thereof. 
    Hepatitis means hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis non-A, hepatitis non-B, hepatitis C, or any other strain of hepatitis generally recognized by the medical community. 
    High risk of occupational exposure means that risk that is incurred because a person subject to the provisions of this subsection, in performing the basic duties associated with his employment: 
1.  Provides emergency medical treatment in a nonhealth-care setting where there is a potential for transfer of body fluids between persons; 
2.  At the site of an accident, fire, or other rescue or public safety operation, or in an emergency rescue or public safety vehicle, handles body fluids in or out of containers or works with or otherwise handles needles or other sharp instruments exposed to body fluids; 
3.  Engages in the pursuit, apprehension, and arrest of law violators or suspected law violators and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids; or 
4.  Is responsible for the custody, and physical restraint, when necessary, of prisoners or inmates within a prison, jail, or other criminal detention facility, while on work detail outside the facility, or while being transported and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids. 
    Occupational exposure, in the case of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, means an exposure that occurs during the performance of job duties that may place a worker at risk of infection. 
b.  Presumption. Any emergency rescue or public safety member who suffers a condition or impairment of health that is caused by hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, that requires medical treatment, and that results in total or partial disability or death shall be presumed to have a disability suffered in the line of duty, unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence; however, in order to be entitled to the presumption, the member must, by written affidavit as provided in F.S. § 92.50 verify by written declaration that, to the best of his knowledge and belief: 
1.  In the case of a medical condition caused by or derived from hepatitis, he has not: 
(i)  Been exposed, through transfer of bodily fluids, to any person known to have sickness or medical conditions derived from hepatitis, outside the scope of his employment; 
(ii)  Had a transfusion of blood or blood components, other than a transfusion arising out of an accident or injury happening in connection with his present employment, or received any blood products for the treatment of a coagulation disorder since last undergoing medical tests for hepatitis, which tests failed to indicate the presence of hepatitis; 
(iii)  Engaged in unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior, as identified by the Centers for Disease Control or the Surgeon General of the United States, or had sexual relations with a person known to him to have engaged in such unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior; or 
(iv)  Used intravenous drugs not prescribed by a physician. 
2.  In the case of meningococcal meningitis, in the ten days immediately preceding diagnosis he was not exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known to have meningococcal meningitis or known to be an asymptomatic carrier of the disease. 
3.  In the case of tuberculosis, in the period of time since the member's last negative tuberculosis skin test, he has not been exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known by him to have tuberculosis. 
c.  Immunization. Whenever any standard, medically recognized vaccine or other form of immunization or prophylaxis exists for the prevention of a communicable disease for which a presumption is granted under this section, if medically indicated in the given circumstances pursuant to immunization policies established by the advisory committee on immunization practices of the U.S. Public Health Service, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required by the city to undergo the immunization or prophylaxis, unless the member's physician determines in writing that the immunization or other prophylaxis would pose a significant risk to the member's health. Absent such written declaration, the failure or refusal by an emergency rescue or public safety member to undergo such immunization or prophylaxis disqualifies the member from the benefits of the presumption. 
d.  Record of exposures. The city shall maintain a record of any known or reasonably suspected exposure of an emergency rescue or public safety member in its employ to the disease described in this section and shall immediately notify the member of such exposure. An emergency rescue or public safety member shall file an incident or accident report with the city of each instance of known or suspected occupational exposure to hepatitis infection, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis. 
e.  Required medical tests; preemployment physical. In order to be entitled to the presumption provided by this section: 
1.  An emergency rescue or public safety member must, prior to diagnosis, have undergone standard, medically acceptable tests for evidence of the communicable disease for which the presumption is sought, or evidence of medical conditions derived therefrom, which tests fail to indicate the presence of infection. This subsection does not apply in the case of meningococcal meningitis. 
2.  On or after June 15, 1995, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required to undergo a preemployment physical examination that tests for and fails to reveal any evidence of hepatitis or tuberculosis. 
(c)  Benefits for disability not incurred in line of duty. Any member with ten years or more credited service who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, which disability is not directly caused by the performance of his duties as a firefighter shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to 3.85 percent of his average final compensation multiplied by the total years of credited service. A member may select an actuarially equivalent joint and survivor benefit as provided for in subsection 38-355(a)(2). Terminated persons, either vested or nonvested, are not eligible for disability benefits. 
(d)  Conditions disqualifying benefits. Each member who is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
(1)  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or narcotics; 
(2)  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections or while committing a crime; 
(3)  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the armed forces; and 
(4)  Injury or disease sustained after his employment as a firefighter with the city shall have terminated. 
(e)  Physical examination requirement. 
(1)  A member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician and/or surgeon, who shall be selected by the board for that purpose. The board shall not select the member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose, except in an unusual case where the board determines that it would be reasonable and prudent to do so. 
(2)  Any retiree receiving disability benefits under provisions of this article may be periodically reexamined by a qualified physician and/or surgeon who shall be selected by the board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the board finds that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, the board shall recommend to the city that the retiree be returned to performance of duty as a firefighter, and the retiree so returned shall enjoy the same rights that he had at the time he was placed upon pension. If the retiree so ordered to return shall refuse to comply with the order within 30 days from the issuance thereof, he shall forfeit the right to his pension. 
(3)  The cost of the physical examination and/or reexamination of the member claiming or the retiree receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by the board incident to the physical examination such as, but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the fund. 
(4)  If the retiree recovers from disability and reenters the service of the city as a firefighter, his service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he reentered the service of the city will not be considered as credited service for the purposes of the system. 
(5)  The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability claims. 
(f)  Payments. The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled in the event of the member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be: 
(1)  If the retiree recovers from the disability prior to his normal retirement date, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery; or 
(2)  If the retiree dies without recovering from disability or attains his normal retirement date while still disabled, the payment due next preceding his death or the 120th monthly payment, whichever is later. 
Provided, however, the disability retiree may select, at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in section 38-355(a)(1) or 38-355(a)(2), which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit. 
(Ord. No. 987, § 1(8), 3-10-1998; Ord. No. 1045, § 7, 6-13-2000; Ord. No. 1191-05, § 2, 1-10-2006) 
Sec. 38-354. - Vesting. 
    If a member terminates his employment with the city, either voluntarily or by discharge, and is not eligible for any other benefits under this system pursuant to this article, the member shall be entitled to the following: 
(1)  If the member has less than ten years of credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a refund of his accumulated contributions or the member may leave it deposited with the fund. 
(2)  If the member has ten or more years of credited service upon termination, the member shall be entitled to a monthly retirement benefit, determined in the same manner as for normal or early retirement and based upon the member's credited service, average final compensation and the benefit accrual rate as of the date of termination, payable to him commencing at the member's otherwise normal or early retirement date, determined as if he had remained employed; provided he does not elect to withdraw his accumulated contributions and; provided the member survives to his otherwise normal or early retirement date. If the member does not withdraw his accumulated contributions and does not survive to his otherwise normal or early retirement date, his designated beneficiary shall be entitled to a benefit as provided for a deceased member, vested or eligible for retirement under preretirement death. 
(3)  Any vested member of the system whose position is terminated, for whatever reason, but who remains employed by the city in some other capacity, shall have all retirement benefits accrued up to the date of such termination under this system preserved, provided he does not elect to withdraw his accumulated contributions from this system. Such accrued retirement benefits shall be payable at his otherwise early, reduced as for early retirement, or normal retirement date under this article, or later, in accordance with the provisions of this system. 
(Ord. No. 987, § 1(9), 3-10-1998) 
Sec. 38-355. - Optional forms of benefits. 
(a)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early retirement as specified in this article, a member, upon a written request to the board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one of the following options: 
(1)  A retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the retiree for his lifetime only. 
(2)  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the retiree during the lifetime of the retiree and following the death of the retiree, 100 percent, 75 percent, 66 2/3 percent or 50 percent of such monthly amount payable to a joint pensioner for his lifetime. Except where the retiree's joint pensioner is his spouse, the present value of the payments to the retiree shall be no less than 50 percent of the total present value of payments to the retiree and his joint pensioner. 
(3)  If a member retires prior to the time at which Social Security benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as Social Security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the system, based upon the Social Security law in effect at the time of the member's retirement. 
(b)  The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner (subsection (a)(2) of this section) or beneficiary to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system in the event of the member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. A member may change his beneficiary at any time. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner and the member's retirement income benefits have commenced, the member may thereafter change his designated beneficiary at any time, but may only change his joint pensioner twice. Subject to the restriction in the previous sentence, a member may substitute a new joint pensioner for a deceased joint pensioner. 
(c)  The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive benefits under the system shall thereupon cease. 
(d)  Upon the change of a retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this section, the amount of the retirement income payable to the retiree shall be actuarially determined to take into account the age of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the retiree and to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the retiree's then-current benefit at the time of the change. Any such retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board and on completion will be filed with the board. If no designated beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the retiree subsequent to his retirement shall be paid as provided in section 38-357(b). 
(e)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(1)  If a member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under section 38-352. 
(2)  If the designated beneficiary or joint pensioner dies before the member's retirement under the system, the option elected will be canceled automatically, and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his retirement. 
(3)  If both the retiree and the beneficiary designated by the member or retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with section 38-357(b). 
(4)  If a member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of section 38-351(a) and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary designated by the member in the amount computed as if the member had retired under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
(f)  A retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check.

The contributions made by each member to the fund shall be designated as employer contributions pursuant to Section 414(h) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Such designation is contingent upon the contributions being excluded from the members' gross income for federal income tax purposes. For all other purposes of the system, such contributions shall be considered to be member contributions. 
(2)  Method. Such contributions shall be made by payroll deduction. 
(b)  State contributions. Any monies received or receivable by reason of state law, for the express purpose of funding and paying for retirement benefits for city firefighters, shall be deposited in the fund comprising part of this system immediately, and under no circumstances, more than five days after receipt by the city. 
(c)  City contributions. So long as this system is in effect, the city shall make quarterly contributions to the fund in an amount equal to the difference in each year, between the total aggregate member contributions for the year, plus state contributions for such year, and the total cost for the year, as shown by the most recent actuarial valuation of the system. The total cost for any year shall be defined as the total normal cost, plus the additional amount sufficient to amortize the unfunded past service liability as provided in F.S. § 112.60 et seq. 
(d)  Other. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the fund, but such deposits must be accounted for separately and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis. Funds arising from these sources may be used only for additional benefits for members, as determined by the board, and may not be used to reduce what would have otherwise been required city contributions.

Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the system shall cease. 
(b)  If a deceased member or retiree failed to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection (a) of this section or if the beneficiary named by a deceased member or retiree predeceased the member or retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the system with respect to such deceased member or retiree, shall be paid to the estate of the member or retiree and the board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum. 
(c)  Any payment made to any person pursuant to this section shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to the deceased member and any other persons with rights under the system and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested under the system.

Upon termination, the fund shall be distributed in accordance with the following procedures: 
(1)  The board shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value required to fund all the nonforfeitable benefits after taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The board shall inform the city if additional assets are required, in which event the city shall continue to financially support the system until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded. 
(2)  The board shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or otherwise, for each member entitled to benefits under the system as specified in subsection (3). 
(3)  The board shall distribute the asset value as of the date of termination in the manner set forth in this subsection, on the basis that the amount required to provide any given retirement income is the actuarially computed single-sum value of such retirement income, except that if the method of distribution determined under subsection (2) involves the purchase of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given retirement income is the single premium payable for such annuity. The actuarial single sum value may not be less than the member's accumulated contributions to the system, with interest if provided by the system, less the value of any benefits previously paid to the member from the system. 
(4)  If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection (3), and after the payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the city, less return to the state of the state's contributions, provided that, if the excess is less than the total contributions made by the city and the state to date of termination of the system, such excess shall be divided proportionately to the total contributions made by the city and the state. 
(5)  The board shall distribute, in accordance with subsection (2), the amounts determined under subsection (3). 
    If, after 24 months after the date the system terminated or the date the board received written notice that the contributions thereunder were being permanently discontinued, the city or the board of the system has not complied with all the provisions in this section, the department of management services shall effect the termination of the system in accordance with F.S. § 175.361.

(c)  Eligible rollover distribution. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the member's benefit, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities); and any distribution made to satisfy section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

The DROP may be amended by a city ordinance at any time and from time to time, and retroactively if deemed necessary or appropriate, to amend in whole or in part any or all of the provisions of the DROP. However, except as otherwise provided by law, no amendment shall make it possible for any part of the DROP's funds to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of persons entitled to benefits under the DROP. No amendment shall be made which has the effect of decreasing the balance of the DROP account of any member. 
(2)  Facility of payment. If the board shall find that a member or other person entitled to a benefit under the DROP is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident or is a minor, the board may direct that any benefit due him, unless a claim shall have been made for the benefit by a duly appointed legal representative, be paid to his spouse, a child, a parent or other blood relative, or to a person with whom he resides. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of the liabilities of the DROP for that benefit. 
(3)  Information to be filed. Each member, beneficiary or other person entitled to a benefit, before any benefit shall be payable to him or on his account under the DROP, shall file with the board the information that it shall require to establish his rights and benefits under the DROP. 
(4)  Prevention of escheat. If the board cannot ascertain the whereabouts of any person to whom a payment is due under the DROP, the board may, no earlier than three years from the date such payment is due, mail a notice of such due and owing payment to the last known address of such person, as shown on the records of the board or the city. If such person has not made a written claim therefor within three months of the date of the mailing, the board may, if it so elects and upon receiving advice from counsel to the DROP, direct that such payment and all remaining payments otherwise due such person be canceled on the records of the DROP. Upon such cancellation, the DROP shall have no further liability therefor, except that in the event such person or his beneficiary later notifies the board of his whereabouts and requests the payment due to him under the DROP, the amount so applied shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of the DROP.

a.  Any elections, notifications or designations made by a member pursuant to the provisions of the DROP shall be made in writing and filed with the board in a time and manner determined by the board under rules uniformly applicable to all employees similarly situated. The board reserves the right to change from time to time the manner for making notifications, elections or designations by members under the DROP if it determines after due deliberation that such action is justified in that it improves the administration of the DROP. In the event of a conflict between the provisions for making an election, notification or designation set forth in the DROP and such new administrative procedures, those new administrative procedures shall prevail. 
b.  Each member or retiree who has a DROP account shall be responsible for furnishing the board with his current address and any subsequent changes in his address.

If any check mailed by registered or certified United States mail to such address is returned, mailing of checks will be suspended until such time as the member or retiree notifies the board of his address.

INTERIM RULE #95-2 
(January 6, 1995) 
RECONCILIATION OF ACCUMULATED LEAVE TIME 
SECTION I. 
    December 31 of each year is established as the date upon which each classified employee's accumulated annual leave is reconciled with regard to the maximum amount of leave which may be accumulated. All accumulated annual leave in excess of the maximum permitted by city policy which an employee has not used by the end of December 31 of each calendar year shall expire, except as provided under Section II below. 
SECTION II. 
    Accumulated annual leave in excess of the maximum permitted by the Civil Service Ordinance which an employee has not used by the end of December 31 of each calendar year may be carried over to the following calendar year if the following conditions have been met: 
1. The employee has been prevented from using his or her annual leave by the requirements of the employee's job and employer. 
2. Carrying forward to the next calendar year unused annual leave is to be approved by the City Manager and the City Council of the City of Milton. 
SECTION III. 
    Sections 1 and 2 of this rule shall not apply to the determination of each employee's entitlement to annual leave based on the employee's years of service as set forth in the Civil Service Ordinance of the City of Milton. The date of employment is the date from which each employee's years of service shall be measured for this purpose. 
    In the event an employee has experienced a break in service, the date of employment to be used from which the employee's years of service are measured for determining entitlement to annual leave shall be the beginning date of employment for the current, uninterrupted period of employment with the City. 
SECTION IV.

INTERIM RULE #95-3 
(January 6, 1995) 
SECTION 1: PURPOSE 
    All applicants for vacant classified position must submit with their applications documentation which proves the applicant has satisfied educational requirements. It is the policy of the Civil Service Board that applications for vacant classified positions will not be considered unless and until all such supporting documentation has been submitted. The purpose of this rule is to provide an exception to this general policy for an applicant who has actually satisfied all educational requirements, but cannot produce such educational documentation through no fault of the applicant. 
SECTION II: EXCEPTION 
    Applications for vacant classified positions will be considered without required supporting documentation providing the applicant has satisfied all educational requirements under the following conditions: 
1.  The applicant certifies that they have taken all reasonable steps to acquire lost certificates and/or copies of the documents, and has been unable to secure the documents. 
2.  Secondary proof that the applicant has satisfied all educational requirements is submitted with the application. If such secondary proof is not available at the time the application is submitted, the application will be considered when it appears that such secondary proof exists and can be acquired and submitted prior to the employment of the person who will fill the vacant position. 
For an application to be considered under this exception, the applicant must submit, by affidavit, facts and available documentation which show that the above requirements have been met. 
The secondary proof which is required under this rule that all educational requirements have been met may include, but shall not be limited to the following: 
A.  Evidence that the applicant has completed advanced education or training which required completion of the education which is necessary to meet the requirements of the vacant classified position. 
SECTION III: NO WAIVER OF EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS 
    This rule is not a waiver of educational requirements for vacant positions, and is not to be construed as such. Before employment, the proposed employee must provide satisfactory evidence that educational requirements have been met. The evidence submitted by each applicant pursuant to this rule will be examined on a case-by-case basis to determine if the rule's requirements have been satisfied. 
SECTION IV: ENACTMENT 
    This rule shall be enacted as provided by ordinance.

INTERIM RULE #95-4 
(January 6, 1995) 
SECTION 1: PURPOSE 
    Pursuant to Civil Service Ordinance and rules, the responsibilities of the Civil Service Board include establishing an interview board to interview and grade the qualifications of applicants for vacant classified positions. No member of the Civil Service Board shall apply for a vacant classified position. This situation could affect the ability of the Civil Service Board to render an unbiased decision on the merits of the Civil Service Board member applicant. This situation could also expose the Civil Service Board and the interview process to criticisms and accusations of favoritism and cronyism. 
    The City Manager, or the City Clerk as the case may be, fills the vacant classified position from the eligibility list of job applicants prepared by the interview board and certified by the Civil Service Board. The City Manager and City Clerk regularly and frequently appear before the Civil Service Board on matters involving the employment of members of the classified service of the City of Milton. The City Clerk also serves as the secretary of the Civil Service Board. To place the City Manager and City Clerk in a position where he/she must fill a vacant classified position from a list of approved applicants which includes a Civil Service Board member could affect the ability of the City Manager or City Clerk to make an unbiased decision based solely on the merits of the applicants, without concern as to the effect such a decision would have on future dealings with the Civil Service Board. This potential "chilling effect" is undesirable and places an unfair burden on the City Manager and City Clerk. 
    This rule has been promulgated to avoid criticism or favoritism, to avoid the potential for favoritism and improper influence entering into the hiring process, and to avoid the potential "chilling effect" on hiring decisions made by the City Manager and City Clerk. 
SECTION II: NO CIVIL SERVICE BOARD MEMBER MAY APPLY 
1.  No active or alternate member of the Civil Service Board may apply for a vacant position in the classified service of the City of Milton. If a member of the Civil Service Board wishes to apply for a vacant position, he/she must first resign his/her position as a member of the Civil Service Board. 
SECTION III: ENACTMENT 
    This rule shall be enacted as provided by Ordinance.

SECTION III. PROMOTION & PROBATIONARY PERIOD 
    When a member of the classified service who has successfully completed their initial probationary period with the city, accepts a promotion to a new position, they shall serve a six month probationary period in the new position. In the event that the employee is unable to successfully perform in the new position within the six (6) month probationary period, they shall have return rights to their previous position or a similar position in the city. Such return rights shall be based on seniority, ability to perform the work, and satisfactory performance in a former or like position in the City. 
    If no existing vacancies are available for the senior employee to return, the City Manager or City Clerk in the case of the Clerk's employees, shall conduct a reduction in force (RIF) to obtain a position for the returning employee.

SECTION V: ACCRUED RETIREMENT, ANNUAL, AND SICK LEAVE: 
    The annual and sick leave accrued by the transferring employee prior to the transfer shall not be affected by the employee's transfer to the new position.

BREAKS IN SERVICE 
SECTION I: RECITALS AND PURPOSE 
    This rule is for the purpose of deciding the issue of when to establish the hire-in date for promotion purposes of a classified employee who has recently become reemployed by the City after having left the employ of the City on a previous occasion. The research of the Civil Service Board indicates that, in the past, all such reemployed employees established new hire-in dates for purposes of promotion at the beginning of the current uninterrupted employment, and have received no credit for promotional seniority for previous employment. 
    The Civil Service Board has promulgated this rule in order to be consistent with past treatment of employees and to set forth a clearly defined written policy on this issue which this Board believes is the best policy under the circumstances. 
SECTION II: HIRE-IN DATE 
    The hire-in date for all classified employees for promotion purposes shall be the beginning date of employment for the current, uninterrupted period of employment with the City. No classified employee shall receive any credit or consideration for previous employment with the City when establishing this hire-in date. This shall be the case regardless of the reason for the employee leaving the City's employment previously or the length of time between the end of the employee's prior employment with the City and the beginning of the current, uninterrupted employment. 
    Example 1: Employee A is employed by the City on June 1, 1975, and leaves the City's employment in good standing for other employment on July 15, 1983. On January 1, 1987, employee A is rehired by the City for the same job he had when he left. Employee A's new hire-in date for promotion purposes is January 1, 1987. 
    Example 2: Employee B is employed by the City on August 15, 1983. On August 15, 1986, employee B leaves the City's employment in good standing to attend college. After one semester, employee B returns to the employment of the city on December 15, 1986. Employee B's new hire-in date for promotion purposes is December 15, 1986.

    Section 2. During any period in which emergency leave is in effect without pay the employee shall continue to receive from the City his fringe benefits, such as hospitalization insurance coverage. 
    Section 3. It shall be the policy of the City not to grant emergency leave for a period in excess of forty-five (45) days without determining the position of the City Manager or the City Clerk in the case of the Clerk's employees, concerning the granting of such additional emergency leave. 
PART II: Authorized and unauthorized leave. 
    Section 1. All annual leave is considered authorized leave when the employee has requested leave for this purpose in advance, and obtained permission from his supervisor. 
    Section 2. All sick leave is considered authorized leave when the employee is absent from work because of illness or injury, or for reasons directly related to such illness or injury, and satisfactory evidence of this illness is presented by the employee to his supervisor. Provided, however, a sick leave request shall be filled out and signed by the employee upon returning to work. 
    Section 3. Any unauthorized absence of any employee shall be promptly reported, in writing, to management. Any such unauthorized leave may be subject to disciplinary action.

The supervisor will authorize the absence or instruct the employee to return to work immediately. 
    Section 5.

(d)  Receipts obtained by the commission of fraud upon any issuing authority are void. Any person who has fraudulently obtained a receipt, or who has fraudulently received any transfer of a receipt issued to another, and has thereafter engaged in any business or occupation requiring a receipt under color thereof is subject to prosecution for engaging in a business or occupation without having the required receipt under state law. Such receipt may not be issued in any county other than the county where the veteran is a resident citizen elector, unless such veteran produces a certificate of the tax collector of his home county to the effect that no exemption from taxation has been granted to such veteran in his home county under this section. 
(e)  Neither this nor any other law exempts any person from the payment of any amount required by law for the issuance of a license to sell intoxicating liquors or malt and vinous beverages.

DIVISION 4. - POLICY FOR CITY CALL-OUT SERVICES 

Sec. 48-146. - Established for call-out services and maintenance problems on the city's side of the property line. 
    It is city policy to charge a reasonable fee for call-out services delivered to customers whose sewer lines are maintained by city staff. Such fees shall be charged when maintenance problems occur between the clean out point located in front or the side of the customer's residence and the applicable property line. If a clean-out point is not already in place and in order to determine what side of the property line has generated the problem, a clean out point will be established between the front of the customer's residence and the property line during the call-out service. It shall also be city policy to render services free of charge when maintenance problems occur on the city side of the property line or on the city side of the point where the customer's line connects to the sewer delivery system. 
(Ord. No. 940, § 1, 7-11-1995; Ord. No. 1265-07, § 1, 12-11-2007) 
Sec. 48-147. - Procedure. 
    The following steps will be strictly followed regarding the implementation of the sewer and water call-out policy: 
(1)  Step 1. When a customer contacts the city to advise that a maintenance problem is occurring, the customer will be concurrently notified that a call-out fee will be appropriately assessed should the problem be determined to be on the customer's side of the property line. 
(2)  Step 2. City staff shall initially secure a verbal commitment from the customer that the call-out fee system is understood. City staff shall also ensure that the customer understands that the customer or a designated representative will be required to be at the residence when the maintenance crew arrives in order to properly perform the call-out service. 
(3)  Step 3. A permission slip, form no. WS-01, Water/Sewer Department Permission to Work Agreement (attachment 1 is kept on file at the city clerk's office) must be signed by the customer or designated representative before city staff shall initiate and/or complete the required work, unless the city staff determines that reasonable cause exists for starting work or an emergency situation requires immediate corrective action. 
(4)  Step 4. Once the problem is located and liability determined, the customer shall be briefed and informed by the city staff as to the customer's responsibility and financial obligation in rectifying the problem. At this point, the customer shall have the option to authorize the city staff to complete the required work as appropriate or may choose to have a private contractor finish the job. 
(5)  Step 5. City staff shall calculate the time and other appropriate charges for the purpose of billing the customer for the required corrective work. 
(6)  Step 6. City staff shall generate an itemized bill for utilizing the city statement of service and materials charge form 4227, and promptly forward to the customer for payment. Said payment shall be due within 30 days from the date of the itemized billing. This itemized billing statement shall be considered the first notice issued. 
(7)  Step 7. If within 45 days from the initial date of itemized billing, the payment has not been received, a delinquent billing or second notice, form no. WS-02 (attachment 2 is kept on file at the city clerk's office), shall be mailed stipulating a water service cutoff date. If payment has not been received by the established cutoff date, a work order to cut off the water services will be generated for customer nonpayment. A customer shall be given a minimum total of two notices and 60 days to make full payment before the city services are cut off for nonpayment of the maintenance bill. Prior to reconnection and restoration of the city services, the call-out service maintenance bill and the applicable reconnection fee must be paid in full. 
(Ord. No. 940, § 2, 7-11-1995; Ord. No. 1182-05, § 1, 7-12-2005; Ord. No. 1265-07, § 2, 12-11-2007) 
Sec. 48-148. - Customers liable for fees.

(Ord. No. 940, § 3, 7-11-1995; Ord. No. 1265-07, § 3, 12-11-2007) 
Sec. 48-149. - Exceptions and reimbursement. 
    It shall be city policy that the city manager shall have the authority to consider various mitigating circumstances for the day-to-day application of this policy, to include water service lines and reimbursement for services paid by the customer for problems determined to be city generated. At any time, and in particular during regularly established business hours, the city has adequate and immediate resources available to remedy problems that occur on the city's side of the sewer system. Therefore, absent extraordinary circumstances, there will be no reimbursement for corrective maintenance accomplished by noncity employees. If such city generated problems occur, it shall be the inherent responsibility of the homeowner and the plumber to promptly notify the city in accordance with the provisions of this division in order to effect proper corrective action by city staff personnel. The city manager may waive the fees as he deems appropriate and circumstances dictate. The city manager may not waive fees without just cause. In the event of natural disasters, such as floods or hurricanes, this policy shall be leniently applied and/or cancelled by recommendation of the city manager to the city council

Sec. 48-181. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Air gap separation means an unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water to a tank, plumbing fixture, or other device and the flood rim of the receptacle, and which shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe measured vertically above the flood level rim of the vessel. In no case shall the gap be less than one inch. This gap shall also be above the established 100-year flood level. 
    Atmospheric vacuum breaker means a backflow prevention device which is operated by atmospheric pressure in combination with the force of gravity. The unit is designed to work in a vertical plan only. The moving part consists of a poppet valve, which must be carefully sized to slide in a guided chamber and effectively shut off the reverse flow of water when a negative pressure exists. 
    Auxiliary water supply means any water supply on or available to the premises other than the purveyor's approved public potable water supply. These auxiliary water supplies may include water from another purveyor's public potable water supply or any natural source such as a well, spring, river, harbor, etc., or used waters or industrial fluids. These waters may be polluted, contaminated, or may be objectionable and constitute an unacceptable water source over which the water purveyor does not have sanitary control. 
    Backflow means the flow of water or other liquids, mixtures or substances into the distribution pipes of a potable supply of water from any source other than its intended source. 
    Backflow prevention device means a device to counteract backpressure or prevent backsiphonage. 
    Backflow prevention device, approved, means a device that has met the requirements of one or more of the following standards: 
(1)  AWWA C-506, standard for backflow prevention devices, reduced pressure principle and double checkvalve types. 
(2)  ASSE 1001, atmospheric type vacuum breakers. 
(3)  ASSE 1011, hose connection vacuum breakers. 
(4)  ASSE 1020, pressure-type vacuum breakers. 
(5)  ASSE 1024, dual check-type backflow preventer (residential use only). 
(6)  ASSE 1013, reduced pressure principle backpressure backflow preventers. 
(7)  ASSE 1015, double checkvalve-type backpressure backflow preventers. 
(8)  USC-FCCC, University of Southern California Foundation for Cross Connection Control and Hydraulic Research. 
    Backpressure means backflow caused by a pump, elevated tank, boiler or other means that could create pressure greater than the supply pressure. 
    Backsiphonage means backflow due to a negative or subatmospheric pressure within a water system. 
    Containment means a method of controlling potential and/or confirmed cross connections by installation of a double check assembly or a reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device. 
    Cross connection means any physical arrangement whereby a public water supply system is connected, directly or indirectly, with any other water supply system, sewer, drain, conduit, pool, storage reservoir, plumbing fixture or other device which contains or may contain contaminated water, sewage or other waste or liquid of unknown or unsafe quality, which may be capable of imparting contamination to the public water supply system as a result of backflow. Bypass arrangements, jumper connections, removable sections swivel or change-over devices or any other temporary or permanent devices through which or because of which backflow could occur are considered to be cross connections. 
    Department means the department of water and sewer. 
    Double checkvalve assembly means an assembly composed of two single, independently acting checkvalves, including tightly closing shutoff valves located at each end of the assembly and suitable connections for testing the watertightness of each checkvalve. 
    Health hazard means any conditions, devices, or practices in any water supply system or in its operation which create or may create a danger to the health and well-being of the water consumer. 
    Isolation means a method of controlling potential and/or confirmed cross connections by the installation of an air gap separation or a vacuum breaker. 
    Pressure vacuum breaker means a breaker similar to an atmospheric vacuum breaker, except that the checking unit poppet valve is activated by a spring. This type of vacuum breaker does not require a negative pressure to react and can be used on the pressure side of a valve. 
    Public water supply. 
(1)  The term "public vacuum breaker" means any system or water supply intended or used for human consumption or other domestic use, including source, treatment, storage and distribution where water is furnished to: 
a.  Any community; 
b.  A collection or number of individuals; or 
c.  The public for human consumption or domestic use. 
(2)  The term "public water supply" does not include supplies serving one single-family residence. 
    Reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device means a device incorporating two or more checkvalves and an automatically operating differential relief valve located between the two checkvalves, two shutoff valves and equipment with necessary appurtenances for testing. The device shall operate to maintain the pressure in the zone between the two checkvalves, less than the pressure of the public water supply side of the device even at cessation of normal flow. In case of leakage of either checkvalve, the differential relief valve shall operate to maintain this reduced pressure by discharging to the atmosphere. When the inlet pressure is two pounds per square inch or less, the relief valve shall open to the atmosphere, thereby providing an air gap in the device. This air gap shall also be above the 100-year flood level. 
(Ord. No. 919, § 3, 6-14-1994) 
Sec. 48-182. - City required to ensure protection of public health. 
    The city, in its operation of a public potable water supply system, is required to ensure the protection of the public health through the provision of minimum requirements and standards for design, construction, operation, and maintenance of its system. It is essential that physical cross connections, which create or have the potential to create an imminent and substantial danger to the public health, be eliminated for the distribution system and plumbing systems of customers. Backflow can result in the potable water system becoming a transmitter of disease, toxic materials and other hazardous liquids. Therefore, it is necessary to establish and maintain a cross connection control policy to protect the health of water consumers by the control of actual and/or potential cross connections through methods of containment and/or isolation. 
(Ord. No. 919, § 1, 6-14-1994) 
Sec. 48-183. - City authority to require installation of approved backflow device; installation at customer's expense; termination of service for noncompliance; notice; testing and retesting. 
(a)  The city is responsible for the protection of its public potable water distribution system from backflow of contaminants or pollutants through any water service connection. If, in the judgment of the department, an approved backflow prevention device is required at the water service connection to any of its customer's premises for the safety of the users of the water system, the department shall give notice in writing to the customer that an approved backflow prevention device shall be installed at the customer's expense, if this customer is a commercial customer or residential customer with a pool and/or has an auxiliary water supply. 
(b)  Failure, refusal or inability on the part of the customer to meet the department's time schedule for the installation of such device shall constitute grounds for discontinuance of water service until such device has been properly installed. Any licensed plumber may install the proper device in the correct manner. 
(c)  Compliance testing after the initial installation and regularly scheduled maintenance tests shall be performed by the department. 
(d)  For a failed compliance test the after initial installation or a failed scheduled maintenance test, it shall be the responsibility of the commercial customer or the residential customer with a pool and/or auxiliary water supply to have the backflow prevention device repaired by qualified personnel and to have the retest performed by the department in the specified time. The department shall give, in writing, a notice of failure and a specified amount of time for repairs to the customer. Upon completion of the repairs, the department shall be notified so that a retest can be performed. 
(e)  If any known or suspected accidental pollution or contamination of the consumer's or the department's potable water system occurs, the consumer shall promptly take steps to confine any further spread of pollution or contamination and shall immediately notify the department of the situation. 
(Ord. No. 919, § 4, 6-14-1994) 
Sec. 48-184. - Backflow prevention requirements; examples where unhealthy conditions found; types and installation of devices. 
(a)  All premises having an auxiliary water supply which is not or may not be of safe bacteriological or chemical quality and which is not acceptable as an additional source to the water and sewer department shall have an approved air gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device installed at the customer's expense, to protect the public water supply against backflow. 
(b)  For all premises where there is water or substances that could be objectionable, but not hazardous to health, if introduced into the public water system, including fire protection systems, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air gap separation, an approved double check valve assembly, or an approved vacuum breaker installed by the customer. 
(c)  For all premises where there is any material dangerous to health, which is handled in such a fashion as to create an actual or potential hazard to the public water system, the public water system shall be protected by an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device installed by the customer. Examples of premises where these conditions have been found to exist include: 
(1)  Sewage treatment plants; 
(2)  Sewage pumping stations; 
(3)  Chemical manufacturing plants; 
(4)  Hospitals; 
(5)  Mortuaries; and 
(6)  Plating plants. 
(d)  For all premises where there are uncontrolled cross connections, either actual or potential, the public water system shall be protected by an approved air gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device. 
(e)  For all premises where security requirements or other prohibitions or restrictions make it impossible or impractical to perform a complete in-plant cross connection survey, the public water system shall be protected with an approved air gap separation or an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device. 
(f)  For all premises more than two stories high, excluding basements, the public water system shall be protected by an approved double checkvalve assembly. 
(g)  All backflow prevention devices shall be installed at a location designated by the water and sewer department. Generally, this will be immediately on the customer's side of the meter. If circumstances make this location impractical, the backflow prevention device may be placed further downstream from the meter. However, any piping between the meter and the backflow prevention device must be either exposed or readily accessible for inspection. 
(h)  The following types of facilities shall normally require the installation of the designated backflow prevention devices. Residential backflow prevention devices shall be installed by the department with the cost thereof, except for residences with swimming pools, and/or auxiliary water supply, being paid by the city.

Sec. 48-185. - Inspection of premises suspected of potential health hazards; questionnaire; change in water usage; additional devices may be required. 
(a)  The city shall conduct inspections of customers premises where suspected cross connections or potential cross connections may exist. Customers shall be notified in advance of the inspections and the reasons for the inspections. Should any cross connections or potential cross connections be detected, the customer shall be notified in writing of the appropriate type of backflow prevention device to be installed. Refusal by a customer to allow an inspection shall be considered prima facia evidence of the existence of cross connections, thereby requiring the installation of an approved reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device at the customer's expense or the disconnection of service. 
(b)  For existing facilities, customers will be asked to complete a questionnaire on their water usage in order to make a preliminary determination of the potential health hazard to the department's water distribution systems. When such information or other knowledge indicates a potential health hazard, a survey of the customer's water system shall be conducted. Such surveys need not be a detailed inspection of the location or disposition of water lines, but can be confined to establishing the water use on the premises; the existence of any cross connections; the availability of auxiliary water supplies; the use or availability of pollutants, contaminants, and other liquid, solid or gaseous substances that may be used industrially for the stabilization of water supplies and other procedures for determining the degree of health hazard. 
(c)  All new services shall be classified at the time of the application to indicate the degree of hazard anticipated and, hence, the type of device required. This information shall be given to the applicant in writing. Any later change in water usage may require a change in the type of device. If no realistic evaluation of the proposed water uses can be determined, the consumer, architect, engineer or other appropriate individual should be advised in writing that eventually circumstances may require the installation of additional backflow protection of the water supply serving the premises. 
(d)  All backflow prevention devices installed on the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived which do not meet the requirements of this section, but were approved devices for the purposes described in this article at the time of the installation and which have been properly maintained shall be excluded from the requirements of this article, except monthly fees, so long as the department/city manager is ensured that they will satisfactorily protect the utility system. Whenever the existing device is moved from the present location or requires more than minimum maintenance or when the department/city manager finds that the maintenance constitutes a hazard to health, the unit shall be replaced by a backflow prevention device meeting the requirements of this section. 
(e)  All water customers of the department shall be required to notify the department, in writing, of any changes in their water usage. These changes will be evaluated to determine if there is an increase in the potential health hazard and if such increase requires the installation of a device. If a device is already in place, it will be determined if this device is adequate or if a different type of device is required. 
(Ord. No. 919, § 6, 6-14-1994) 
Sec. 48-186. - Monthly fees for customers. 
    A monthly fee based on the size of the connecting line or water meter on the flow side shall be assessed for the purposes of this article. The fees are as currently established or as hereafter adopted by resolution of the city council from time to time to cover the installation and testing of residential backflow devices for those residence without pools and/or auxiliary water supplies and for the testing of devices installed on all commercial customers and residential customers with pools and/or auxiliary water supplies. 
(Ord. No. 919, § 7, 6-14-1994) 
Sec. 48-187. - Cross connection, installation and testing records to be maintained. 
    Appropriate records shall be maintained by the department of all potential and confirmed cross connections. Installations and tests of backflow prevention devices shall be recorded and filed for future reference. 
(Ord. No. 919, § 8, 6-14-1994) 
Sec. 48-188. - Routine testing and maintenance; repairs at customer's expense; bypassing backflow device prohibited. 
(a)  Routine testing of backflow prevention devices shall be performed by the department. The frequency of testing will be dependent upon the type of device installed and the potential health hazard involved. 
(b)  Customers will be notified in advance of the date and approximate time that any testing will be performed. It will be necessary to shut off the water service for an approximate period not exceeding 15 minutes, and every effort will be made to schedule tests to suit the customer's convenience. If the customer's operations cannot permit an interruption of service, it will be the customer's responsibility to have two approved backflow prevention devices installed in parallel so that one may be used while the other is being tested. Bypasses around backflow prevention devices are expressly forbidden. 
(c)  If any devices tested are found to be faulty, the customer will immediately be notified and will be required to have the device promptly repaired or replaced at his expense. In high hazard situations, it may be necessary to terminate service until a properly operating device is in place. The customer should notify the department as soon as any faulty device has been corrected so that it may be retested. 
(d)  It shall be the responsibility of all commercial customers and residential customers with pools and/or auxiliary water supplies to maintain all backflow preventers and vacuum breakers within the building or on the premises in good working order and to make no piping or other arrangements for the purpose of bypassing any backflow device or vacuum breaker. Bypassing of any backflow device or vacuum breaker is expressly forbidden. 
(Ord. No. 919, § 9, 6-14-1994) 
Sec. 48-189. - This article applicable to customers served by the city. 
    All customers served by the city shall be embraced by the provisions of this article.

(a)  The rates and charges for gas service shall be billed monthly and all bills for such charges shall be paid on or before the due date on the bill, subsequent to the month for which such services were received. Such charges and bills shall be deemed delinquent and a penalty of ten percent authorized and collected if such bills are not paid when due; and the city attorney is hereby authorized and directed to enforce and collect any such charges remaining delinquent together with the penalty thereon. 
(b)  The city clerk shall render the bills for gas services and they shall be collected and accounted for by him in the manner as prescribed by law and other duly adopted city ordinances. 
(c)  If any such bill is not paid on or before the cutoff date of the month following the billing for such charges and services, the services and facilities afforded to the premises where such bill has not been paid shall be cut off and discontinued and shall not be again connected until the payment of a connection charge as currently established or as hereafter adopted by resolution of the city council from time to time. The payment of all charges for prior services and penalties must be made before the hour of 3:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, for service to be reconnected that day; if payment is made after 3:00 p.m. service will be reconnected the next regular workday. No connection or reconnection of service shall be rendered on legal city holidays or other than as set forth in the preceding sentence. Whenever the meter or any equipment provided by the city has been altered or tampered with, the customer shall pay the cost of purchase and installation of a new meter along with a fee as currently established or as hereafter adopted by resolution of the city council from time to time. Customers transferring their accounts within the city utility system shall pay a fee as currently established or as hereafter adopted by resolution of the city council from time to time and shall be subject to the connection schedule set forth in this subsection. New customers of the system shall post a deposit and be subject to the same service fees. 
(d)  The term "walk through" connection means a temporary gas, water and sewer service connection, or any combination thereof, for the purpose of the sale or showing of any structure.

(f)  A disconnection fee as currently established or as hereafter adopted by resolution of the city council from time to time will be charged to gas customers who have their service disconnected for the summer months. A charge as currently established or as hereafter adopted by resolution of the city council from time to time will be charged to reconnect the service. 
(g)  Safety regulations require that the owner or tenant of any structure being connected or reconnected to the city's gas service be present so that the city may ensure that there are no open valves inside the structure. Each connection or reconnection must therefore be scheduled with the city. In the event that the owner or tenant requesting service is not present at the scheduled appointment, a charge as currently established or as hereafter adopted by resolution of the city council from time to time will be assessed for appointments.

(c)  Btu adjustment. The amount computed under any of the city's natural gas sales rate may be adjusted by multiplying such amount by the average of the Btu content per cubic foot of the gas delivered to the city. For purposes of determining such average hearing value, the city may rely on reports furnished by the city's supplier. 
(d)  City authority to proportionately levy charges to offset gas rate increases. The amount computed under any of the city's natural gas sales rates may be increased to reflect any applicable proportionate part of any directly allocable tax, impost or assessment imposed or levied by any governmental authority, which is assessed or levied against the city or directly affects the city's cost of operation and which the city is legally obligated to pay in the basis of meters, customers, or rates of, or revenues from gas or service sold, or on any other basis where direct allocation is possible.

(Ord. No. 1219-06, § 2, 9-28-2006) 
Sec. 48-537. - Established; duties and powers; solely responsible for its actions. 
(a)  The city owns and operates a public natural gas utility system within and outside its political boundaries, and has determined that there is a substantial need and demand for the acquisition, purchase, transmission, delivery, transfer, distribution, financing, administration and management of energy resources for public energy utilities, and customers and consumers of such products and resources, within and outside the state. 
(b)  The successful ownership, management and administration of public energy utility systems requires an adequate and efficient means for the acquisition, transmission, supply and distribution of energy products and resources, the financing, acquiring, constructing, equipping, owning, operating, maintaining, repairing, managing, expanding, consolidating, improving, leasing and disposing of utility infrastructure, transmission lines, meters, storage facilities, safety facilities, administrative, and other necessary or convenient means, methods and mechanics of wholesale or bulk energy product or supply facilities for public energy utilities, energy consumers, and industries and other bulk users. 
(c)  In order to reduce and relieve the administrative burdens of government currently borne by the public agencies and public energy utilities in connection with the acquisition, receipt and supply of the energy products and resources needed for their energy utilities, and to relieve such public agencies and public utilities of the burdens of future management, planning and administrative responsibilities attendant to securing, acquiring, negotiating and arranging for the receipt, transmission, distribution, and delivery of energy products, energy resources and supplies of energy for their energy utility systems, the city wishes to create the public gas and energy commission (the "commission") as an administrative entity on behalf of the city for such purpose. 
(d)  For administrative economy and convenience, the city further wishes to provide for cooperation with other public agencies and public utilities that may, by interlocal agreement with the city, wish to establish the commission as a separate legal and administrative entity pursuant to F.S. § 163.01(5)(c), and to become members thereof from time to time, in order to exercise jointly the powers which the members have to carry on the planning, development, acquisition, transfer, consolidation, financing, ownership, management, improvement, expansion and operation of the energy products, supply and energy resources set forth herein, and every aspect thereof. 
(e)  Pursuant to F.S. § 163.01, together with all of the home rule powers granted by the Constitution and laws of the state, and all other applicable provisions of law (the "Act"), the city wishes to enable the commission to act as a separate legal and administrative entity for the members, for the purposes for which the commission is created, as described herein and in the commission's charter; and the city further wishes to authorize the commission to be established and constituted by such members, and to authorize the appropriate city officials to enter into an interlocal agreement on the city's behalf for such purposes with any public agency hereafter approved by the city. 
(f)  The city council has determined that the creation and the establishment of the commission serve public purposes by reducing duplication of efforts and improving services, and increasing market power in addressing the needs for energy including, without limitation, negotiating energy agreements, advance purchase agreements, and contracts for the acquisition, transmission and delivery of energy supplies and resources, and by providing programs for the advance purchase, financing, and resale of gas, electricity, liquefied hydrocarbon products, ethanol, synthetic fuels, fossil fuels, biomass, bulk energy or other resources, and by implementing financings and programs as hereinafter described, for the public purpose of promoting, planning, establishing, financing, acquiring, receiving, transmitting, selling and distributing wholesale or bulk energy products or energy resources and sources of energy supply for public utilities, consumers, bulk energy or natural energy resource users and other prospective purchasers. In addition to the express grant of power and authority herein set forth, the purposes for which the commission is organized, and the powers and authorizations it is granted, shall include all purposes, powers and authorizations described or contained in the commission's charter, or under any applicable laws of the state. 
(g)  The creation of a special purpose administrative entity for the ownership, operation and management of the energy projects and energy programs, financings and projects as provided herein, and providing assistance and a means of cooperation for public utilities referred to herein, all as contemplated hereby, will provide economies of scale, strengthen market power, increase bargaining power, attract employees with specialized talents and abilities, reduce overhead and provide other financial advantages to the energy utility operations of the parties, and will improve the level of environmental protection, and improve and enhance service to customers, users and purchasers of the energy resources contemplated hereby. 
(h)  The city intends that the commission shall have all possible powers which may be conferred upon the commission by the city and any members or participating governmental units or under any state authorization, pursuant to law which may be necessary or desirable to enable the commission to acquire, construct, finance, own, manage, operate and dispose of projects and programs for energy products, energy, energy resources, energy supplies, energy processing, development, production, delivery or exchange of energy or energy products or energy resources, or for acquisition, transmission, delivery or handling of energy or energy products or energy resources in the chain of location, development, production or usage of energy or energy products or energy resources, and to fulfill the objectives and purposes of this division or its charter, insofar as the same relate to energy products and energy resources for public utilities, bulk, industrial or wholesale users, or other consumers, customers and purchasers of such energy products and resources. 
(i)  It is the city's intent that the commission be hereby specifically authorized, in addition to its other powers, to undertake projects and programs pursuant to the provisions of, without limitation, F.S. chs. 159 and 180, and F.S. § 163.01, insofar as the same may relate in any way to the purposes and objectives for which the commission is created. All actions of the commission shall be deemed to be an exercise of the powers possessed by the members or the participating governmental units, or granted directly to the commission pursuant to its charter and any law or ordinance. It is further the city's intent that, pursuant to F.S. § 163.01(5)(o), all liabilities incurred by the commission resulting from or arising out of or in connection with projects and programs (the "project liabilities"), shall be the sole responsibility and obligation of the commission. None of the members or any participating governmental units shall be responsible for any project liabilities and no project liabilities shall constitute a pledge of the faith and credit or taxing power of or constitute an obligation of any of the participating governmental units. The appropriate formalities shall be observed by the commission officials at all times, so as to ensure that the commission's liabilities are in no way imputed to the members or the participating governmental units; provided that any failure to observe such formalities shall not operate, or be deemed, to create any liability of the members or the participating governmental units, except to the extent expressly approved in writing. To the fullest extent of the law, the members and participating governmental units shall be held harmless from any such liabilities and no act or course of action by any member or participating governmental unit shall be deemed to constitute a undertaking which would cause any such member or participating governmental unit to be liable for the actions or obligations of the commission, unless such undertaking and intent to assume such responsibility shall be set forth in a resolution, duly adopted by the governing body of the participating governmental unit for such purpose. 
(j)  The enumerated powers granted to the commission hereunder or under the resolutions shall not be deemed to be exhaustive or complete, but are intended to express in general terms the scope of the activities authorized for the commission. Except to the extent hereafter agreed to in writing with the commission or with members or other participating governmental units, nothing herein shall in any way be deemed to limit or restrict the ability of any member or participating governmental unit to exercise in its own name, for its own purposes, any or all of the same powers granted to the commission.

Fewer than a quorum may adjourn from time to time and may compel the attendance of absent directors. The board of directors shall select one of its directors as chairperson, another as vice-chairperson, and another as secretary/treasurer and shall prescribe their duties, powers and terms of office. The board of directors may, upon notice to each participating governmental unit, also select a chief operating officer of the commission with duties delegated from time to time to administer the affairs, duties, policies, and project completion adopted by the commission. The chief operating officer shall be an officer of the commission, but not a voting member of the board. 
(d)  The board of directors shall hold meetings as called. All meetings shall be given public notice and shall be open to the public, and the commission shall use its best efforts to give notice thereof at least 24 hours prior to any such meeting; except upon emergency for reasons set forth in a declaration filed with records maintained by the administrator or the secretary/treasurer of the commission at the time of such meeting.

The administrator shall have the power, on behalf of the commission, to contract for such services, and engage such professionals and consultants, as may be necessary in the opinion of the administrator for the acquisition of projects, to conduct due diligence inquiries and secure financing with respect to such acquisitions and to develop and plan such acquisitions. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit the commission and its staff from also undertaking any of such matters enumerated in this subsection. If at any time the commission shall determine that the services of the administrator are unnecessary or duplicative, the commission shall submit to the members an alternative plan for provision of the administrative services. During any period in which such alternative plan shall be in operation following the approval of such plan by a majority of the members, the provisions herein regarding the administrator shall be inapplicable to the extent provided in such plan. 
(g)  Except to the extent otherwise provided by law, any failure on the part of the administrator or the commission to comply with the provisions hereof regarding organization of the commission, composition and office of its members, giving of notices and other administrative matters shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any commission bonds.

Sec. 48-541. - Bond requirements for funding projects, programs. 
(a)  In addition to the powers granted to the commission by other provisions of this division, the commission also shall have the power to borrow money and it is hereby authorized to provide by resolution, at one time or from time to time, for the issuance of bonds for the purpose of paying all or a part of the cost of any project or any portion thereof or to establish and fund any program. The principal of and interest on such bonds shall be payable solely from revenues to be derived from or in connection with the operation or financing of projects or implementation or administration of programs and/or any or all funds of the commission derived from sources other than ad valorem taxation and legally available for such purpose. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rates, shall mature at such times, not exceeding 40 years, from their dates, as may be determined by commission resolution, and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the commission's option, at such prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the commission prior to the issuance of the bonds. The commission shall determine the form of the bonds, the manner of executing the bonds, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the places or payment of the principal thereof and the interest thereon, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the state. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or such facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he had remained in office until such delivery. All bonds shall have and are hereby declared to be and to have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under state law, subject to such restrictions on transferability as the commission may determine with respect to any series or issue of bonds at the time of issuance thereof. Provision may be made for the registration of any of the bonds in the name of the owner thereof as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversions of any bonds registered as to both principal and interest into coupon bonds. Bonds may be issued without regard to any limitation on indebtedness prescribed by any law. The commission may sell bonds in such manner, at such interest rates, without limitation, and for such prices as it may determine to be for the commission's best interests. Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the commission may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts, interim certificates, or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds have been executed and are available for delivery. The commission may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated, destroyed or lost. Such bonds may be issued without any other proceedings, or the happening of any other conditions or things than those proceedings, conditions or things which are specifically required by this division and the charter. 
(b)  In the event that the commission shall have financed, acquired or constructed a project and, to pay the cost of such acquisition or construction thereof, shall have issued bonds payable from the funds provided for herein, and in the further event that the commission shall desire to construct additions, extensions, improvements or betterments to such project or to acquire by purchase or to construct an additional project and to combine such additional project with the project theretofore financed, purchased or constructed, and to refund such outstanding bonds, the commission may provide for the issuance of a single issue of bonds under the provisions of this division, the agreement and its charter, for the combined purposes of refunding such bonds then outstanding and of constructing such additions, extensions, improvements or betterments or of acquiring by purchase or of constructing such additional project, and the principal of and interest on such bonds shall be payable from the funds pledged therefor and provide herein. 
(c)  Any holder of bonds, except to the extent the rights therein granted may be restricted by a commission resolution adopted before the issuance of such bonds, may by suit, action, mandamus or other proceedings, protect and enforce any and all rights under state law or granted hereunder or under such resolution and may enforce and compel the performance of all duties required by this division, the agreement and the charter, or by such resolution to be performed by the commission or by any officer thereof. 
(d)  The commission may evidence any borrowing authorized herein by the issuance of its bonds; provided, however, that any such bonds shall state on their face that such bonds shall not be or constitute a general obligation or indebtedness of the commission, the state, any political subdivision or municipality thereof, but shall be a limited, special obligation of the commission, payable solely from the revenues, receipts and other sources available to the commission. Such bonds shall further provide that no owner of any such bonds shall have the right to require or compel the payment of such bonds, except from the sources set forth therein. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prohibit any participating governmental unit from securing its obligations to the commission with any funds or bonds which may lawfully be pledged for such purpose. 
(e)  The members shall not have the power or authority, either individually or in concert to: 
(1)  Take any action that would adversely affect the validity or enforceability of any commission bonds and all covenants and obligations of the commission, or the tax-exempt status of the bonds; 
(2)  Impair or limit the ability of the commission to levy, collect, receive and apply any commission revenues pledged to secure any commission bonds; or 
(3)  Refuse any commission request, the bondholders or a participating governmental unit to take any action reasonably within the control of such parties, which may, in the opinion of nationally recognized bond counsel, be necessary to maintain, preserve, or ensure the validity, enforceability, and, to the extent applicable, the tax-exempt status, of any commission bonds; provided that such members shall have been provided sufficient funds to make any required payments in connection therewith, and shall have received indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it for any liabilities or claims arising from or in connection with the members' compliance with such request. The commission, by issuing any bonds, the city, by its adoption of the ordinance from which this division is derived, and each member, by executing the agreement, thereby agree and acknowledge that the holders of any bonds or other obligations for borrowed money shall be beneficiaries of this division. 
An initial issue of commission bonds for the purpose of financing a program for the purchase and prepayment of supplies of natural gas to public utilities is hereby approved in the amount of $2.5 Billion. Such bonds shall be issued by the commission in installments from time to time, subject to a determination by the directors of the commission that such program and the economic features of the bonds are in the commission's best interests. The terms of such bonds shall be substantially as described in the form of bond indenture attached to the ordinance from which this section is derived as exhibit B which is kept on file at the city clerk's office, as the same may be amended, modified or revised prior to the delivery of the bonds or as may be permitted by the terms of the bond indenture. Nothing in this approval shall be deemed to imply that other commission bonds are required to be approved by the city.

(Ord. No. 1271-08, § 6, 1-8-2008) 
Sec. 48-577. - Stormwater user's fees established. 
    There shall be imposed on each and every developed property in the city, a stormwater user's fee, which shall be set from time to time by ordinance or resolution, and in the manner and amount prescribed by this article. 
(Ord. No. 1271-08, § 7, 1-8-2008) 
Sec. 48-578. - Equivalent residential unit/equivalent commercial unit (ERU/ECU). 
(a)  Establishment. There is established for purposes of calculating the stormwater user's fee the equivalent residential unit (ERU) and the equivalent commercial unit (ECU). 
(b)  Definitions. The ERU is the average square footage of the heated and cooled area of a detached single-family residential property. The ECU is the average heated and cooled area of all other developed properties. 
(c)  Setting the ERU/ECU. The ERU and ECU shall be set by the city council from time to time by ordinance or resolution.

(Ord. No. 1271-08, § 8, 1-8-2008) 
Sec. 48-579. - Property classification for stormwater user's fee. 
(a)  Application to all developed properties. A stormwater management utility fee shall apply to all developed property within the city, including those properties classified as nonprofit or tax-exempt for ad valorem tax purposes. The stormwater management utility fee shall also apply to all governmental property, but shall not include any public right-of-way. 
(b)  Property classifications. For purposes of determining the stormwater user's fee, all properties in the city are classified into one of the following classes: 
(1)  Single-family residential property; 
(2)  Other developed property; 
(3)  Undeveloped or exempt property, if any. 
(c)  Single-family residential fee (ERU). The municipality's governing body finds that the intensity of development of most parcels of real property in the municipality classified as single-family residential is similar and that it would be excessively and unnecessarily expensive to determine precisely the square footage of the improvements (such as buildings, structures, and other impervious areas) on each such parcel. Therefore, all single-family residential properties in the city shall be charged a flat stormwater management fee, equal the base rate, regardless of the size of the dwelling, parcel, or other improvements. 
(d)  Other developed property fee (ECU). The fee for other developed property (i.e., nonsingle-family residential property) in the municipality shall be the base rate multiplied by the numerical factor obtained by dividing the total impervious area (square feet) of the property by one ECU. The impervious surface area for other developed property is the square footage for the buildings and other improvements on the property. The minimum stormwater management fee for other developed property shall be the base rate of a ECU. 
(e)  Exempt property. Property that does not discharge stormwater runoff into the stormwater or flood control facilities of the municipality at any time and under any circumstances and unimproved/undeveloped property. For the purpose of the stormwater utility it is assumed all developed property discharges stormwater. 
(Ord. No. 1271-08, § 9, 1-8-2008) 
Sec. 48-580. - Base rates. 
    The city council shall, by ordinance or resolution, establish the base rates for the stormwater user's fee. The base rates shall be calculated to insure adequate revenues to fund the costs of stormwater management and to provide for the operation, maintenance, and capital improvements of the stormwater system in the city. 
(Ord. No. 1271-08, § 10, 1-8-2008) 
Sec. 48-581. - Credits for nonsingle-family residential developed property. 
(a)  A stormwater management utility fee shall apply to all developed property within the city, including those properties classified as nonprofit or taxexempt for ad valorem tax purposes. The owner of any property seeking credit for on-site stormwater management facilities shall be responsible for the cost of demonstrating to the city's satisfaction that said facilities reduce acceptable hydraulic and pollutant loadings on other properties and the city's stormwater management system. If determined to be appropriate the applicant will be required to incur the cost of the analysis both for demonstrating reductions/impact and validating same. A feepayer for nonsingle-family residential developed property may obtain a credit against the monthly stormwater management utility fee as follows: 
(1)  Retention credits. A feepayer may obtain a credit against the monthly stormwater management utility fee by construction and maintenance of on-site stormwater retention facilities serving the property pursuant to the following schedule: 
a.  A ten percent credit for stormwater retention facilities that meets or exceeds stormwater retention requirements for the state department of environmental protection as set forth in F.A.C. ch. 62-25; provided, however, the credit contemplated in this subparagraph shall be available only to such nonsingle-family residential developed properties which as of January 1, 2008, do not meet current state department of environmental protection stormwater retention requirements.

a.  A ten percent credit if the property owner furnishes to the city an irrevocable easement in a form and manner acceptable to the city allowing the city to utilize at least five contiguous acres of property upon which the city may under emergency conditions dispose stormwater that may accrue off-site and which will then be retained or detained upon the feepayer's property; and

(4)  Maximum credit. The available credits set forth in subsections (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section are not mutually exclusive, rather each individual credit that is applicable may be added to accumulate an aggregate credit against a non-single-family residential development property's monthly stormwater management utility fee; provided, however, the total allowed credits shall be capped at 50 percent and under no circumstance shall a non-single-family residential developed property be entitled to more than 50 percent credit against the applicable monthly stormwater management utility fee.

(b)  The city reserves the right to modify or change the terms, conditions, and provisions of this section. No feepayer or property owner shall rely upon any current or future terms of this section and subsequent changes hereto may limit the amount and extent of credit to which a feepayer or property owner might have otherwise received.

b.  Façade calculations. With the exception of accent/trim materials, there shall be no more than two primary building materials used. The allowed façade materials shall not apply to entry doors and/or roll-up doors. 
c.  Calculation of permitted material amounts. The amount of permitted material shall be calculated using the gross square footage of wall area per façade. 
If, for example: 
A building has a front façade with a gross façade area of 1,200 square feet with 360 square feet dedicated to windows and doors - 
Begin with 1,200 square feet for required building material calculations. 
Subtract from the gross square footage of wall area the area of the windows and doors. 
The balance of the wall area is 840 square feet. 
The remaining façade shall have no more than 252 square feet of accent or trim materials (i.e., 840 × 30% = 252). The remaining façade shall be brick, stucco, or other allowable material. 
C.  Build-To Dimensions. 
(1)  A build-to line (BTL) is the set dimension on a lot, measured from the applicable lot line, where a certain percentage of the building frontage must be located. 

Figure 2.2.2. Build-To-Line Diagram 
D.  Building Height.

F.  Floor Area Ratio (FAR). FAR is a measure of use intensity that may be utilized to determine the appropriateness of a development. 
The formula used to determine FAR is as follows: 
FAR = Total floor area of a building/the total lot area. 
G.  Grade. A reference plane representing the average of finished ground level adjoining the building at all exterior walls. When the finished ground level slopes away from the exterior walls, the reference plane is established by the lowest points within the area between the building and the lot line or, when the lot line is more than six feet from the building, between the building and a point six feet from the building. 
H.  Gross Floor Area (GFA). The gross floor area (GFA) of a structure is the sum of the gross horizontal areas of all floors of the structure as measured from the exterior faces of the exterior walls or from the centerline of walls separating two buildings. 

Figure 2.2.5. Impervious Surface Coverage Diagram 
I.  Impervious Surface Coverage. 
(1)  Impervious surface coverage is a measure of intensity of land use that represents the portion of a site that is occupied by structures, pavement, and other impervious surfaces which do not allow for the absorption of water into the ground. The Impervious Surface Ratio (ISR) of a lot is calculated by dividing the total area of impervious surface(s) by the total area of the lot. 
(2)  When an approved pervious pavement system is utilized, the ISR will be calculated at a reduced rate determined by the performance measure achieved by the pervious pavement system installed. 
a.  The area of approved pervious pavements and open grid paving systems will be calculated as 50% impervious surface, provided that no barrier to infiltration is installed beneath the material. Refer to Article 13 for installation and maintenance standards. 
b.  Other types of pervious surfaces, such as permeable pavers, porous asphalt, or gravel-crete, and green roofs will be credited based upon field performance data and coefficients of permeability provided by the manufacturer. Refer to Article 12 for installation and maintenance standards.

(2)  A rear lot line is the lot line opposite and most distant from the front lot line, or in the case of triangular or otherwise irregularly shaped lots, an assumed line at least ten feet in length entirely within the lot, parallel to and at a maximum distance from the front lot line. 
(3)  On a corner lot, the corner side lot line is perpendicular or approximately perpendicular to the front lot line and is the longer street abutting lot line of a corner lot. 
(4)  On an interior lot, the interior side lot line is perpendicular or approximately perpendicular to the front lot line and abuts the adjacent lot. 
(5)  A street lot line is any lot line separating a lot from a street right-of-way. 
P.  Lot Width. Lot width is the horizontal distance between the side lot lines measured at right angles to its depth along a straight line parallel to the front lot line at the minimum front setback line. For cul-de-sac lots or pie-shaped lots, lot width is measured at the front building line of the structure between side lot lines. 

Figure 2.2.9. Lot Width Diagram 
Q.  Sign Dimension Measurement. 
(1)  Sign area is measured as follows: 
a.  For signs on a background, the entire area of the background is calculated as sign area, including any material or color forming the sign face and the background used to differentiate the sign from the structure against which it is mounted. Sign area does not include any supports or bracing. 
b.  The area of a sign shall be the area within the smallest square, rectangle, parallelogram, triangle, circle or half-circle, the sides of which touch the extreme points or edges of the sign face. For signs consisting of freestanding letters or logos, the sign area is calculated as the total area of each square, circle, rectangle, or triangle, or combination thereof, which encompasses each individual letter or logo. Sign area does not include any supports or bracing. 
c.  Window signs printed on a transparent film and affixed to the interior or exterior of a windowpane are calculated as individual letters or logos, provided that the portion of the transparent film around the perimeter of the individual letters or logos maintains 100% transparency of the window. 
d.  The sign area of a three-dimensional, free-form, or sculptural (non-planar) sign is calculated as 50% of the sum of the area of the four vertical sides of the smallest cube that will encompass the sign. 
i.  Where two sign faces are placed back to back on a single sign structure, and the faces are at no point more than three feet apart, the area of the sign shall be counted as the area of one of the faces. 
ii.  Where four sign faces are arranged in a square, rectangle, or diamond, the area of the sign shall be the area of the two largest faces. 

Figure 2.2.10. Sign Area Measurement Diagram

Figure 2.2.12. Sight Triangle Measurement Diagram 
S.  Yards and Setbacks. A yard is the open space area between the building line of a principal building and the adjoining lot lines. A required setback is the required minimum distance a principal building must be located from a lot line, which is unoccupied and unobstructed by any portion of a principal building or accessory structure, unless permitted by this Code, and may be equal to or lesser than a yard. A setback is located along a lot line for the minimum depth specified by the zoning district in which such lot is located. A build-to zone or build-to line is considered a required setback. 
(1)  Front Yard and Front Setback. A front yard is located between a principal building line and the front lot line. A front setback is the required minimum distance per the zoning district that a principal building must be located from the front lot line. The front yard and front setback extend the full width of the lot between side lot lines measured perpendicular to the front lot line. 
(2)  Side Yard and Interior Side Yard Setback. An interior side yard is located between a principal building line and the interior side lot line. An interior side setback is the required minimum distance per the zoning district that a principal building must be located from the interior side lot line. The interior side yard and interior side setback extend along the interior side lot line between the front and rear yard and setback, measured perpendicular to the interior side lot line. For townhouse developments, the interior side yard and interior side setback are applicable to end units only. For semi-detached dwellings, the interior side yard and interior side yard setback do not apply to the lot line where the party wall is located. 
(3)  Rear Yard and Rear Setback. A rear yard is located between a principal building line and the rear lot line. A rear setback is the required minimum distance per the zoning district that a principal building must be located from the rear lot line. The rear yard and rear setback extend between interior side lot lines, measured perpendicular to the rear lot line. In the case of a corner lot, the rear yard and rear setback extend between the interior side lot line to the required corner side setback for the, measured perpendicular to the rear lot line.

(6)  Supplementary Design Review Regulations. Additional Design Review shall be in accordance with Subsection 11.4(D). 
4.3 - CONSISTENCY AND CONCURRENCY DETERMINATIONS 
A.  Generally. 
(1)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to describe the requirements for determining the consistency of proposed development projects with the city comprehensive plan, in addition to meeting the concurrency requirements. 
(2)  Intent. It is the intent of this section to ensure the availability of facilities and services necessary to serve the proposed development, at the adopted level of service standard, concurrent with the impacts of the development. It is further the intent to ensure that a concurrency determination is made by the city prior to the issuance of a development order. 
B.  Consistency with Comprehensive Plan. 
(1)  Presumption. A development proposal shall be presumed to be consistent with the city comprehensive plan if the proposal is found to meet all the requirements of these regulations, excepting those aspects of the development addressed by the comprehensive plan but not covered by these regulations. 
(2)  Challenging the consistency of a development proposal. Any public official or citizen may question the consistency of a development proposal with the comprehensive plan. If a question of consistency is raised, the Planning and Development Department shall make a determination of consistency. The determination will be made prior to the final approval of the development plan by the city. The determination shall be supported with written findings. 
(3)  No presumption in favor of concurrency. Notwithstanding the presumption created in subsection (a) of this section, all applications for development approval within the city shall demonstrate that specified public facilities will be available at the prescribed levels of service concurrent with the impact of the development on those facilities. 
a.  A determination of compliance with concurrency requirements shall be through the procedures described in 4.3(c). 
C.  Concurrency Management System. 
(1)  Generally. The following method of ensuring concurrency shall be known as the Concurrency Management System (CMS) for the City of Milton. The CMS is based upon the city comprehensive plan, especially the capital improvements element and the adopted level of service standards. The system is designed to ensure that the issuance of a development order, city development permit or building permit by the city or county building official will not result in a degradation of the adopted levels of service for specified public facilities and services. The CMS also includes an annual monitoring system for the determination of the availability of adequate capacity of public facilities and services to meet the adopted level of service standards. 
(2)  Adopted levels of service shall not be degraded. 
a.  General rule. The general rule regarding concurrency is as follows: 
i.  All applications for development approval shall demonstrate that the proposed development does not degrade adopted levels of service in the city. The adopted levels of service imply that sufficient treatment, collection and distribution systems must be available and must be adequate to accommodate the additional demands imposed by the proposed development. Any new collection and distribution lines shall be sized in accordance with the requirements contained in the city public works manual; and 
ii.  The latest point at which concurrency is determined is prior to the final development order approval by the appropriate development approval authority. In the case of new subdivisions, the latest point at which concurrency is determined is prior to preliminary plat approval. 
b.  Exception. Notwithstanding subsection (2)(a) of this section, the adopted levels of service may be degraded during the actual construction of new facilities, if upon completion of the new facilities the adopted levels of service will be met, unless otherwise prohibited by local, state or federal requirements. 
(3)  Determination of available capacity. For purposes of these regulations, the available capacity of a facility shall be determined by: 
a.  Adding together: 
i.  The total capacity of existing facilities operating at the required level of service; and 
ii.  The total capacity of new facilities, if any, that will become available on or before the date of occupancy of the development. The capacity of new facilities may be counted only if one or more of the following is shown: 
1)  Necessary facilities are in place, or are under construction, at the time the development order or permit is issued; 
2)  The development order is issued contingent upon the necessary facility and/or service being in place when the impacts of development occur. In the case of residential subdivisions, the time at which the impacts of development occur may be considered to be up to three years from final plat approval; 
3)  The necessary facilities are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement which ensures that the necessary facilities and/or services will be in place when the impacts of the development occur, or for roads and recreational facilities, which ensures that the actual construction will commence within three years of the development order's issuance; and 
4)  The necessary facilities are the subject of a binding executed contract for construction at the time of issuance of the development order or development permit, for roads, parks and recreational facilities. The actual construction or provision of service must commence within three years of issuance of the development order or permit. 
b.  Subtracting from that number the sum of: 
i.  The demand for the service or facility created by the existing development as documented in the city comprehensive plan or as updated based on related state agency data; and 
ii.  The demand for the service or facility created by the anticipated completion of other approved developments, redevelopment, or other development activity. 
(4)  Action upon failure to show available capacity. Where available capacity cannot be shown, the following methods may be used to maintain the adopted level of service: 
a.  The project owner or developer may provide the necessary improvements to maintain the adopted level of service. In such case, the application shall include appropriate plans for improvements, documentation that such improvements are designed to provide the capacity necessary to achieve or maintain the level of service, and recordable instruments guaranteeing the construction, consistent with the calculations of capacity mentioned in subsection (3)(a) of this section. 
b.  The proposed project may be altered such that the projected level of service is no less than the adopted level of service. 
(5)  Burden of showing compliance on developer. The burden of showing compliance with the level of service requirements shall be upon the developer. In order to be approvable, applications for development approval shall provide sufficient information to indicate that adequate facilities and/or services are available at the adopted LOS standards at the time of development impact. This information shall include, but is not limited to, the following: 
a.  Statements or letters of available capacity from local utility providers (i.e., sanitary sewer and potable water); 
b.  A statement of demand generated by the development for solid waste disposal and recreational facilities; 
c.  Copies of FDEP permits for stormwater management in compliance with F.A.C. Ch. 62-25 or letters of exemption thereof; 
d.  Statements relating to the number of vehicle trips generated by the proposed development and identification of related roadway impacts. 
A detailed traffic impact study (TIS) shall be required for any development contributing more than five percent of the adopted level of service maximum roadway volume, or any development significantly altering access to or traffic flow on arterial and collector roadways. The purpose of such traffic impact study shall be to assess the roadway level of service given projected traffic volumes and to determine traffic improvements needed to accommodate development impacts. 
(6)  Determination of concurrency. The determination of concurrency occurs prior to the application review for development approval and shall include compliance with the level of service standards as adopted by the city. 
(7)  Annual report. The city shall monitor the concurrency provision through the preparation of an annual report on the CMS. The initial year of concurrency monitoring, however, shall be based on data contained in the relevant elements of the 2014 Milton Comprehensive Plan. Each annual report shall contain: 
a.  A summary of the actual development activity, including a summary of certificates of occupancy, indicating the quantity of development represented by type and square footage. 
b.  A summary of building permit activity issued by the county, within the city, indicating: 
i.  Those that expired without commencing construction; 
ii.  Those that are active at the time of the report; and 
iii.  The quantity of development represented by the outstanding building permits. 
c.  A summary of development orders approved, indicating: 
i.  Those that expired without subsequent building permits; 
ii.  Those that were completed during the reporting period; 
iii.  Those that are valid at the time of the report, but do have associated building permits or construction activity; and 
iv.  The phases and quantity of development represented by the outstanding development orders. 
d.  An evaluation of each facility and service indicating: 
i.  The capacity available for each at the beginning of the reporting period and at the end of the reporting period; 
ii.  The portion of the available capacity held for valid development orders; 
iii.  A comparison of the actual capacity to calculated capacity resulting from approved development orders and development permits; 
iv.  A comparison of actual capacity and levels of service to adopted levels of service from the city comprehensive plan; 
v.  A forecast of the capacity for each based upon the most recently updated schedule of capital improvements in the city capital improvements element. 
(8)  Use of annual report. The CMS annual report shall constitute prima facie evidence of the capacity and levels of service of public facilities for the purpose of issuing development approvals and development permits during the 12 months following completion of the annual report. 
D.  Adopted levels of service. 
(1)  Potable water. Development activities shall not be approved unless there is sufficient available capacity to sustain a level of service for potable water of 100 gallons per capita per day as established in the potable water sub-element of the city comprehensive plan (1ERU-250 GPD). 
(2)  Sanitary sewer. Development activities shall not be approved unless there is sufficient available capacity to sustain a level of service for wastewater treatment of 100 gallons per capita per day as established in the sanitary sewer sub element of the city comprehensive plan (1ERU-250 GPD). 
(3)  Transportation system. 
a.  Level of service. Development activities shall not be approved unless there is sufficient available capacity to sustain the following levels of service for transportation systems as established in the traffic circulation element of the city's comprehensive plan. See the following traffic circulation table: 
Table 4.4.1. Traffic Circulation Levels of Service 
Facility Type Peak Hour Level of Service Principal arterials D Minor arterials D Collectors D  
b.  Determination of project impact. The impact of proposed development activity on available capacity shall be determined as follows: 
i.  The area of traffic impact of the development shall be determined by the developer subject to review and approval by the city. 
ii.  The projected level of service for roads within the traffic impact area shall be calculated based upon estimated trips to be generated by the project utilizing the Institute of Traffic Engineers trip generation rates by land use type. Where the development will have access to more than one road, the calculations shall show the split in generated traffic and state the assumptions used in the assignment of traffic to each facility. 
(4)  Drainage system. Development activities shall not be approved unless there is sufficient available capacity to sustain a level of service which specifies the design storm as a 100-year critical duration storm, and to treat the first inch of runoff for sites less than 100 acres in size as required in Article 12, Stormwater Management. Additionally, development activities must comply with the stormwater management provisions as contained in this Unified Development Code. 
(5)  Solid waste. Development activities shall not be approved unless there is sufficient available capacity to sustain a level of service of 4.4 pounds per capita per day for solid waste as established in the solid waste sub-element of the city comprehensive plan. 
(6)  Recreation. Development activities shall not be approved unless there is sufficient available capacity to sustain a level of service of five acres per 2,000 people for recreational facilities as established in the recreation and open space element of the city comprehensive plan. 
4.4 - TRANSPORTATION PROPORTIONATE FAIR-SHARE PROGRAM 
A.  Purpose and intent. The purpose of these regulations is to establish a method whereby the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors, to be known as the Proportionate Fair-Share Program, as required by and in a manner consistent with F.S. § 163.3180(16). 
B.  Findings. 
(1)  The council finds and determines that transportation capacity is a commodity that has a value to both the public and private sector and that the city proportionate fair-share program: 
a.  Provides a method by which the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors; 
b.  Allows developers to proceed under certain conditions, notwithstanding the failure of transportation concurrency, by contributing their proportionate fair-share of the cost of a transportation facility; 
c.  Contributes to the provision of adequate public facilities for future growth and promotes a strong commitment to comprehensive facilities planning, thereby reducing the potential for moratoria or unacceptable levels of traffic congestion; 
d.  Maximizes the use of public funds for adequate transportation facilities to serve future growth, and may, in certain circumstances, allow the city to expedite transportation improvements by supplementing funds currently allocated for transportation improvements in the capital improvements element; 
e.  Is consistent with F.S. § 163.3180(16), and supports the following policies in the city comprehensive plan: 
i.  Transportation element goal 1, objectives 1.1 through 1.5 and policies 1.1.1 through 1.5.3 of the comprehensive plan, as amended. 
ii.  Capital improvement element goal 1, objectives 1.1 through 1.5 and policies 1.1.1 through 1.4.4 of the comprehensive plan. 
(2)  The proportionate fair-share program shall apply to all developments in city that impact a road segment in the city Concurrency Management System (CMS) and have been notified of a failure to achieve transportation concurrency approval. The proportionate fair-share program does not apply to designated Transportation Concurrency Exception Areas (TCEAs) or to Developments of Regional Impact (DRIs) using proportionate share under F.S. § 163.3180(12), or to developments exempted from concurrency. 
C.  Requirements. 
(1)  An applicant may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirements of the city by making a proportionate fair-share contribution, pursuant to the following requirements: 
a.  The proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan and this Unified Development Code. 
b.  The city five-year capital improvement program (CIP) or an adopted long term concurrency management system includes transportation improvements that, upon completion, will accommodate the additional traffic generated by the proposed development. 
(2)  The city may choose to allow an applicant to satisfy transportation concurrency through the proportionate fair-share program by contributing to an improvement that, upon completion, will accommodate the additional traffic generated by the proposed development, but is not contained in the CIP where one of the following apply: 
a.  The city adopts, by resolution or ordinance, a commitment to add the improvement to the five-year CIP no later than the next regular update. To qualify for consideration under this section, the proposed improvement must be reviewed by the city council, and determined to be financially feasible pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(16)(b)1, consistent with the comprehensive plan, and in compliance with the provisions of these regulations. Financial feasibility for this section means that additional contributions, payments or funding sources are reasonably anticipated during a period not to exceed ten years to fully mitigate impacts on the transportation facilities. 
b.  If the funds in the adopted city five-year CIP are insufficient to fully fund construction of a transportation improvement required by the concurrency management system, the city may still enter into a binding proportionate fair-share agreement with the applicant authorizing construction of that amount of development on which the proportionate share is calculated if the proportionate fair-share amount in such agreement is sufficient to pay for one or more improvements which will, in the opinion of the governmental entity or entities maintaining the transportation facilities, significantly benefit the impacted transportation system. To qualify for consideration under this section, the proposed improvements must be contained in an adopted short- or long-range plan or program of the local government, MPO, FDOT and/or transit agency. Proposed improvements not reflected in an adopted plan or improvement program, but that would significantly reduce access problems on a major road, such as new roads, service roads, or improved network development and connectivity, may be considered at the city's discretion. The improvements funded by the proportionate fair-share component must be adopted into the five-year CIP of the comprehensive plan at the next annual capital improvements element update. 
(3)  Any improvement project proposed to meet the developer's fair-share obligation must meet the city design standards for locally maintained roadways and those of the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) for the state highway system. 
D.  Intergovernmental coordination to be established. Pursuant to the policies in the city's intergovernmental coordination element, the city shall coordinate with affected jurisdictions, including FDOT, regarding mitigation to impacted facilities not under the jurisdiction of the local government receiving the application for proportionate fair-share mitigation. An interlocal agreement may be established with other affected jurisdictions for this purpose. 
E.  Application; contents; notice; hearing; approval. 
(1)  Upon notification of a failure to satisfy transportation concurrency, applicants shall be notified in writing whether they may be eligible to satisfy transportation concurrency through a proportionate fair-share contribution. 
(2)  Prior to submitting an application for a proportionate fair-share agreement, a pre-application meeting shall be held to discuss eligibility, application submittal requirements, potential mitigation options, and related issues. If the impacted facility is on the strategic intermodal system (SIS), then the state department of transportation (FDOT) will be notified and invited to participate in the pre-application meeting. 
(3)  Eligible applicants shall submit an application to the city that includes an application fee as currently established or as hereafter adopted by resolution of the city council from time to time and the following: 
a.  Name, address, and phone number of owner, developer and agent; 
b.  Property location, including parcel identification numbers; 
c.  Legal description and survey of property; 
d.  Project description, including type and amount of development; 
e.  Phasing schedule, if applicable; 
f.  Description of the requested fair-share method; and 
g.  Copy of the concurrency denial. 
(4)  The Planning and Development Director shall review the application and certify that the application is sufficient within ten business days. If an application is determined to be insufficient or ineligible to participate, the applicant will be notified in writing of the reasons for such deficiencies within ten business days of the application's submittal. If such deficiencies are not remedied by the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the written notification, then the application will be deemed abandoned. The council may in its discretion, grant an extension of time not to exceed 60 days to cure such deficiencies; provided that the applicant has shown good cause for the extension and has taken reasonable steps to effect a cure. 
(5)  Pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(16)(e), proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation for development impacts to facilities on the strategic intermodal system (SIS) requires the concurrence of the state department of transportation (FDOT). The applicant shall submit evidence of an agreement between the applicant and the FDOT for inclusion in the proportionate fair-share agreement. 
(6)  When an application is deemed sufficient and eligible, the applicant shall be advised in writing and a proposed proportionate fair-share obligation and binding agreement will be prepared by the city or the applicant with direction from the city and delivered to the appropriate parties for review, including a copy to the FDOT for any proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation on a strategic intermodal system (SIS) facility, no later than 60 days from the date at which the applicant received the notification of a sufficient application and no fewer than 14 days prior to the city council date when the agreement will be considered. 
(7)  The city shall notify the applicant regarding the date of the council meeting when the agreement will be considered for final approval. No proportionate fair-share agreement will be effective until approved by the council. 
F.  Proportionate fair-share obligation; requirements; calculations. 
(1)  The proportionate fair-share mitigation for concurrency impacts may include, without limitation, separately or collectively: 
a.  Private funds; 
b.  Contributions of land; and 
c.  Construction and contribution of facilities. 
(2)  A development shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate fair-share. The fair market value of the proportionate fair-share mitigation for the impacted facilities shall not differ regardless of the method of mitigation. 
(3)  The methodology used to calculate an applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation shall be as provided for in F.S. § 163.3180(12) as follows: "The cumulative number of trips from the proposed development expected to reach roadways during peak hours from the complete buildout of a stage or phase being approved, divided by the change in the peak hour maximum service volume (MSV) of roadways resulting from the construction of an improvement necessary to maintain the adopted level of service, multiplied by the construction cost, at the time of the developer payment, of the improvement necessary to maintain the adopted level of service." 
Or 
Table 4.5.1. Calculation - Proportionate Fair-Share Obligation 
Proportionate share = s [[(Development trips/(SV increase)] × cost] Where: Development trips = Those trips from the development that are assigned to the roadway segment and have triggered a deficiency per the concurrency management system; SV increase = Service volume increase provided by the eligible improvement to the roadway segment per E; Cost = Adjusted cost of the improvement to the segment. Cost shall include all improvements and associated costs, such as design, right-of-way acquisition, planning, engineering, inspection and physical development costs directly associated with the construction at the anticipated cost in the year it will be incurred.  
(4)  For the purposes of determining proportionate share obligations, the city shall determine improvement costs based upon the actual cost of the improvement as obtained from the capital improvements program, the MPO transportation improvement program, or the FDOT work program. Where such information is not available, improvement cost shall be determined using one of the following methods: 
a.  An analysis by the city of costs by cross section type that incorporates data from recent projects and is updated annually and approved by the council. In order to accommodate increases in construction material costs, project costs shall be adjusted by an inflation factor; or 
b.  The most recent issue of FDOT Transportation Costs, as adjusted based upon the: 
i.  Type of cross section (urban or rural); 
ii.  Locally available data from recent projects on acquisition, drainage, and utility costs; and 
iii.  Significant changes in the cost of materials due to unforeseeable events. 
This method shall be used for all state road improvements not included in the adopted FDOT work program. 
(5)  If the city has accepted an improvement project proposed by the applicant, then the value of the improvement shall be determined using one of the methods provided in this section. 
(6)  If the city has accepted the right-of-way dedication for the proportionate fair-share payment, credit for the dedication of the non-site related right-of-way shall be valued on the date of the dedication at 80 percent of the most recent assessed value by the county property appraiser or, at the applicant's option, by the fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the city and at no expense to the city. The applicant shall supply a drawing and legal description of the land and a certificate of title or title search of the land to the city at no expense to the city. If the estimated value of the right-of-way dedication proposed by the applicant is less than the city's estimated total proportionate fair-share obligation for that development, then the applicant must also pay the difference. 
G.  Proportionate fair-share agreements. 
(1)  Upon the execution of a proportionate fair-share agreement (agreement) the applicant shall receive a city certificate of concurrency approval. Should the applicant fail to apply for a development permit within 12 months of the agreement's execution, the agreement shall be considered null and void, and the applicant shall be required to reapply. 
(2)  Payment of the proportionate fair-share contribution is due in full prior to the issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat and shall be nonrefundable. If the payment is submitted more than 12 months from the date of the agreement's execution, the proportionate fair-share cost shall be recalculated at the time of the payment based on the best estimate of the construction cost of the required improvement at the time of payment, pursuant to section H and adjusted accordingly. 
(3)  Developer improvements authorized under these regulations involving dedications to the city must be completed upon the final acceptance of the improvements and receipt of a warranty bond. 
(4)  Developer improvements authorized under these regulations not involving dedications to the city must be completed upon the recording of a final plat or upon the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
(5)  Any requested change to a development project subsequent to a development order will be subject to additional proportionate fair-share contributions to the extent the change would generate additional traffic. 
(6)  Applicants may submit a letter to withdraw from the proportionate fair-share agreement at any time prior to the agreement's execution. The application fee and any associated advertising costs to the city will be nonrefundable. 
H.  Appropriation of fair-share revenues. 
(1)  Proportionate fair-share revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the city Capital Improvements Program (CIP), or for use as otherwise established in the terms of the proportionate fair-share agreement. 
(2)  In the event a scheduled facility improvement is removed from the CIP, then the revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of another improvement within that same corridor that would mitigate the impacts of development pursuant to the requirements of this code. 
4.5 - IMPACT FEES FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT 
A.  Authorization. This section is enacted pursuant to the general police power, the authority granted to cities by section 2(b), article VIII, of the Florida Constitution, F.S. Ch. 166, and F.S. §§ 163.3161 through 163.3244. 
B.  Purpose and intent. This section is enacted for the purpose of requiring that new development pay for its fair share of public facilities through the imposition of impact fees that will be used to finance, defray, or reimburse all or a portion of the costs incurred by the city for public facilities and services that serve such development. 
C.  Applicability. Unless expressly accepted or exempted, this section applies to all fees which may be imposed by the city to finance capital facilities and maintain levels of service, the need for which is created by new development including, but not limited to: 
(1)  Affordable housing fees; 
(2)  Park and recreational fees; 
(3)  Drainage fees; 
(4)  Police/public safety fees; 
(5)  Transportation improvement fees; 
(6)  Public works fees; 
(7)  Public art and cultural events fees; 
(8)  Fire department fees; 
(9)  Library fees; and 
(10)  Public education fees. 
D.  Exemptions. This division does not apply to: 
(1)  Taxes and special assessments; 
(2)  Fees for processing development applications; 
(3)  Fees for the enforcement of or inspections, pursuant to regulatory ordinances; 
(4)  Fees for utility connection or utility impact fees which are authorized by city Code provisions outside of this section; 
(5)  Fees collected under development agreements, other than impact fees; 
(6)  Fees imposed pursuant to a reimbursement agreement between the city and a property owner for that portion of the cost of a public facility paid for by the property owner which exceeds the need for the public facility attributable to, reasonably related to, and roughly proportional to the development; 
(7)  Fees to mitigate impacts on the environment; 
(8)  Fees imposed, levied, or collected by other governmental agencies, including subdivisions of the state and federal government; and 
(9)  Stormwater utility fees which are authorized by city Code provisions outside of this section. 
E.  Imposition, calculation and collection of impact fees. 
(1)  Calculation of an impact fee shall mean to determine the amount of impact fee to be imposed on a particular development project and includes an individual determination showing a reasonable, and roughly proportional, relationship between: 
a.  The fee's use and the type of development project on which the fee is imposed; 
b.  The need for the public facility or service and the type of development project on which the fee is imposed; and 
c.  The fee amount and the cost of the portion of the public facility or service attributable to the development on which the fee is imposed. 
(2)  The city may only impose impact fees as a condition of approval of new development projects as provided in this section. Fees shall be calculated upon the net increase in density or intensity represented by the new development. 
(3)  The base fee amount of each impact fee for residential and nonresidential development, for each type of public facility or service funded by impact fees, shall be calculated at least every three years and adopted by ordinance. When the city manager determines that it is appropriate to the particular public facility or service, the fee amount may be calculated, imposed and expended by benefit area. 
(4)  After an individualized determination that each impact fee for a development project has been calculated as provided in this section, impact fees shall be imposed prior to issuance of any building permit. 
(5)  Impact fees shall be collected by the city manager at the time of, and as a condition for, issuance of an application for development approval. In no case shall a building permit be issued by the county until such time as the fees established here are collected, except that connection fees shall be collected at the time of application for connection to the utility system. 
(6)  An administrative fee, in the amount of five percent of the impact fee imposed on a development project, shall be collected from that development project with, and in addition to, the impact fee for the purpose of defraying the city's cost of administering the impact fee program. 
(7)  In the event the impact fees are paid prior to, or concurrent with, the issuance of a building permit and subsequently the building permit is amended, the applicant shall pay the impact fee in effect at the time the amended building permit is issued with credit being given for the previous fees paid. 
(8)  In the case of the change of use, redevelopment, expansion, or modification of an existing use of a site which requires the issuance of a building permit, the impact fee shall be based upon the net increase in density or intensity of the proposed use as compared to the most immediately-preceding use of the property for which the permit is requested. 
F.  Notice and hearing required for establishing or increasing impact fees. 
(1)  Prior to establishing or increasing any particular impact fee, the city council shall hold a public hearing. 
(2)  Notice of the time and place of the public hearing, including a general explanation of the matter to be considered, shall be published as required for the adoption of a general ordinance pursuant to F.S. § 166.041. 
(3)  At least ten days prior to the public hearing, the city shall make available to the public data showing the amount or the estimated amount of the impact fee and a summary of the basis for the calculation of the impact fee amount. 
(4)  City council action to establish or increase any impact fee shall be taken only by an ordinance containing findings which demonstrate the basis for calculating the fee. 
G.  Independent impact analysis. 
(1)  A developer may choose to use an independent impact analysis to compute the impact fee due as a result of a development. 
(2)  The developer shall be responsible for the preparation of the draft independent impact analysis and the city manager may accept, reject, or modify the draft analysis. 
(3)  The city manager shall have the authority to approve the person or firm who prepares the draft independent impact analysis on the basis of the person or firm's professional training and experience in preparing development impact analysis. The independent impact analysis shall follow standard methodologies and formats. Prior to the submission of the draft independent impact analysis, the developer shall meet with the city manager to review the requirements for preparing draft independent impact analysis. 
H.  Impact fee accounts. The city may provide for a separate accounting of each type of capital improvement for which an impact fee is imposed. Where benefit areas have been designated by the city manager there may be a separate accounting for each benefit area. The impact fees collected shall be separately accounted for according to type of improvement and benefit area, if relevant. The funds for each impact fee shall be specifically tracked, monitored and accounted for separate from other funds of the city. 
I.  Use of impact fee proceeds. Impact fees may be expended only for the type of capital improvements for which they were imposed, calculated, and collected, in accordance with the time limits and procedures established in this section. If the impact fees were calculated and collected by benefit area, then the fees may be expended only in the benefit area in which they were collected. The impact fees may be used to pay the principal, interest, and other costs of bonds, notes, and other obligations issued or undertaken by or on behalf of the city to finance such improvements. 
J.  Refunds. 
(1)  Upon application of the property owner, the city may refund that portion of any impact fee which has been on deposit over six years and which is unexpended and uncommitted, except as described in subsection (b) of this section. The refund shall be made to the then-current owner of lots or units of the development project. 
(2)  If fees in any impact fee account are unexpended or uncommitted during the sixth year, the fees are exempt from subsection (a) of this section if the city council makes the following findings: 
a.  A need for the capital improvement still exists; 
b.  The fees will be used for an identified purpose within two years; and 
c.  The purpose for which the fees will be used is substantially similar to the purpose for which the fees were collected. 
(3)  The city may refund by direct payment, by offsetting the refund against other impact fees due for development projects by the owner on the same or other property or otherwise by agreement with the owner. 
K.  Statute of limitations. Any judicial action or proceeding to attack, review, set aside, or annul the reasonableness, legality, or validity of any impact fee must be filed and service of process affected within 90 days following the date of imposition of the fee or the final determination of the city council, whichever is later. 
L.  Amendment procedures. Prior to the city council's adoption of the budget and revisions to the capital improvements project list, the city manager shall report at least once every three years to the city council with: 
(1)  Recommendations for amendments to this section, if any; 
(2)  Proposals for changes to the capital improvements project list, identifying capital improvements to be funded in whole or in part by impact fees, if any; 
(3)  Proposals for changes in the boundaries of benefit areas, if any; and 
(4)  Proposals for changes to impact fee rates and schedules, if any. 
M.  Analysis and establishment of fees. Consistent with the foregoing requirements of this section, the city council shall adopt an appropriate impact fee by resolution from time to time. The analysis utilized to establish the applicable fee shall be maintained on file in the city clerk's office.

6.2 - RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS 
A.  Purpose/Intent Statements. 
(1)  General Intent. In order to regulate and limit the height and size of buildings, to regulate public and private space and areas of open space within and surrounding buildings, to classify, regulate and restrict the location of trades and industries, and the location of buildings designed for specified industrial, business, residential and other uses, the land area within the city is hereby divided into the following zoning districts. 
(2)  R-1AA Single-Family Residential Zoning District. The R-1AA Single-Family Residential Zoning District is intended to provide for a neighborhood environment of single-family detached dwellings located on larger lots of 12,500 square feet or more. Limited non-residential uses that are compatible with surrounding residential neighborhoods may be conditionally permitted by the City Council following review by the Planning Board. 
(3)  R-1A Single-Family Residential Zoning District. The R-1A Single-Family Residential Zoning District is intended to provide for a neighborhood environment of single-family attached and detached dwellings located on 9,000 square foot lots that reflect the predominant pattern of single-family residential development in the Planning Area. Limited nonresidential uses that are compatible with surrounding residential neighborhoods may be conditionally permitted by the City Council following review by the Planning Board. 
(4)  R-1 Single-Family Residential Zoning District. The R-1 Single-Family Residential Zoning District is intended to provide for a neighborhood environment of single-family attached and detached located on 7,500 square foot lots that have been established with a smaller lot size than the predominant pattern of single-family residential development. Lots platted prior to the date of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall have a minimum lot area of 5,000 square feet for each single-family dwelling. Limited non-residential uses that are compatible with surrounding residential neighborhoods may be conditionally permitted by the City Council following review by the Planning Board. 
(5)  R-2 One and Two Family Residential Zoning District. The R-2 One and Two Family Residential Zoning District is intended to provide for a denser neighborhood environment of single-family detached and attached and two-family dwellings on lots with a smaller lot size ranging from 6,500 square feet for Single Family to 10,000 square feet for Two Family units, to provide for a more intensive form of residential development. Limited non-residential uses that are compatible with surrounding residential neighborhoods may be conditionally permitted by the City Council following review by the Planning Board. This district may function as a transitional zone between predominantly single-family neighborhoods and adjacent higher density multi-family neighborhoods, mixed-use areas, and non-residential areas. 
(6)  R-3 Multi-Family Residential Zoning District. The R-3 Multi-Family Residential Zoning District is intended to provide for an environment of various dwelling types permitted at higher development densities, including single-family detached and attached, two-family, townhouse, condominium, and low to mid-rise multi-family dwellings. Neighborhood-commercial, live-work units, and light intensity commercial uses and services are encouraged. Furthermore, the District is intended to provide areas where a variety of housing types will exist with and among neighborhood commercial and institutional uses while at the same time creating a dominant architectural character and emphasizing pedestrian oriented activities and ease of access. 
B.  General Residential District Regulations. 
(1)  Residential Districts Dimensional Standards for Non-Residential and Mixed-Use Structures in Addition to Tables 6.2.2 and 6.2.3. 
a.  The front yard setback shall only be required on the primary side of the structure for which a lot has dual street frontage. 
b.  Non-Residential and Mixed-Use Structures are prohibited from external and outside storage and the generation of noise pollution detected outside of the building or non-residential use. 
c.  Where permitted, non-residential buildings may be increased in height; provided that the building is set back from all required yard lines one additional foot for each three feet such building exceeds the height limitation of the zoning district. However, no building shall exceed 48 feet in height except as provided in Subsection 4.2(K). 
(2)  Permitted Intrusions. Intrusions into required building setbacks shall apply with the following additions. The following intrusions are permitted in any required building setback unless otherwise noted. 
a.  Required driveways are permitted in the minimum setback.

c.  Three-story building: 0.90; 
d.  Four to six story building: 1.00 
(4)  Corner lots in Residential Districts. 
a.  On corner lots in residential districts, the side yard regulations shall apply on the street side as well as on the opposing side yard. If a building on a corner lot does not face the same direction as the building on the adjoining lot on either street, there shall be a side yard adjacent to the street, on which the building does not face, no less in width than 50 percent of the front yard required on that street and no accessory building on such corner lot shall extend beyond the front yard line of that street. This regulation shall not prevent the erection of any accessory building in any case where the regulations cannot reasonably be complied with. 
b.  On any corner lot abutting the side of another lot, no part of any structure within 25 feet of the common lot line shall be nearer the side street lot than the required front yard at such abutting lot; 
(5)  Yard Area. Every part of a required yard shall be open from its lowest point to the sky unobstructed; except for the ordinary projection of sills, belt courses, cornices, buttresses, ornamental features, and eaves; provided, however, none of the projections indicated in Subsection 2.2, shall project into a minimum side yard more than 24 inches. Open or enclosed fire escapes, fireproof outside stairways and balconies projecting into a minimum yard or court no more than three and one-half feet, in addition to the ordinary projections of chimneys and flues may be permitted where the same are so placed as not to obstruct light and ventilation and shall not be considered as an increase to the floor area of the building; 
(6)  Maximum Impermeable Surface Ratios. The ISR shall be adhered to in all districts. Pervious materials found in Table 13.5.1 may be utilized, with development approval, as driveways, walkways, side patios, porches, and other hardscaped design elements of a residential use and shall be considered at a reduced percentage of the total impermeable surface area calculation.

A.  Within the districts established on the zoning map or amendments that may hereafter be adopted, there exists: lots; structures; uses of land or water and structures; and characteristics of use which were lawful prior to the adoption or amendment of these regulations, but which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of these regulations or future amendments. It is the intent of this Article to permit existing nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their continuance. 
B.  It is further the intent of this section to ensure that nonconformities are not enlarged upon, expanded, intensified or extended, and are not used as grounds for adding other prohibited structures or uses elsewhere in the same district after the effective date of the ordinance from which these regulations are derived. Additionally, it is the intent of these regulations to ensure that changes in a nonconforming use shall be strictly controlled as specified herein. 
10.2 - NONCONFORMITIES 
A.  Nonconforming Lots of Record. 
(1)  In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of the ordinance from which these regulations are derived.

e.  Any structure or structure and premises in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which such structure is located, and the nonconforming use shall not thereafter be resumed, nor shall any other nonconforming use be permitted; and 
f.  Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure or structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction, as defined in this section, of a structure or structures shall not eliminate the nonconforming uses status of the land. Upon removal or destruction of the nonconforming structure, the use shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which this land is located. 
E.  Conforming Uses Not Altered by Change of Use or Development Activity. An existing use or structure that is conforming to the requirements of these regulations and future amendments thereto, shall not be made to be nonconforming by the change of use or development activity occurring on abutting properties or those in proximity. 
F.  Nonconforming Status Not Altered by Change in Characteristics of Use. If characteristics of use, such as off-street parking, off-street loading, or other matters pertaining to the use of land, structures, or premises, are made nonconforming by these regulations as adopted or amended, no change shall thereafter be made to such characteristics of a use which increases nonconformity with these regulations. Changes may be made which do not increase, or which decrease, such nonconformities.

To avoid undue hardship, nothing in these regulations shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building for which a building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment to the ordinance from which these regulations are derived. If actual construction has not begun under a permit issued prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which these regulations are derived within six months of the date of issuance of the permit, such permit shall become invalid and shall not be renewed, except in conformity with the requirements of these regulations. 
H.  Repairs and Maintenance. Work may be done on any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure, or on any structure containing a nonconforming use, for a period of 12 consecutive months for ordinary repairs, or for the repair or replacement of 30 percent of the current just value of the structure; provided that the cubic area of the structure existing at the time the structure became nonconforming is not increased. 
I.  Nonconforming Structures Unsafe Due to Lack of Maintenance; Repairs Permitted to Make Structure Conforming. If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure or any structure containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to the lack of repair or maintenance, and it is declared by any duly authorized city official to be an unsafe building, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired or rebuilt, except in conformity with the regulations of the district in which it is located. 
J.  Nonconforming Structures Unsafe for Other than Maintenance; Permitted to Repair without Making Structure Conforming. If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure, or any structure containing a nonconforming use is declared by any duly authorized city official to be an unsafe building or unlawful for reasons other than the lack of repair or maintenance, nothing in these regulations shall be construed to prevent the strengthening or restoring of such building or part thereof to a safe condition. Where such un-safeness or unlawfulness of the structure is the result of damage from destruction, the percentage of damage limitations set out in these regulations shall apply. 
K.  Removal and replacement of mobile homes in nonconforming zones. Mobile homes not conforming to the requirements contained in these regulations, may be removed and replaced with a new or improved unit for the owner's occupancy upon submittal of an application to the planning and development department for approval contingent upon compliance with the following requirements: 
(1)  The applicant must comply with the requirements of these regulations contained in this Article, specifically subsection 10.2(C), regarding replacement; 
(2)  The replacement unit must comply with all current local, state, and federal requirements; and 
(3)  The size and amount of utilities to residents and mobile homes in a nonconforming area may not be increased without the approval of the city manager or his designee. 
ARTICLE 11. - RESOURCE PROTECTION STANDARDS 

11.1 - ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE LANDS 
A.  Intent. It is the intent of this article to provide specific requirements to ensure the protection and conservation of environmentally sensitive lands, including their natural functions. 
B.  Requirements. Any development proposal containing environmentally sensitive lands (ESL), as herein defined, or development activity adjacent to ESL shall be classified as a major development for development review purposes. In addition to the requirements of this article all development activity within areas of special flood hazard must comply with the related requirements and provisions contained in Chapter 29 of the City of Milton Code of Ordinances, Floodplain Management. 
(1)  The Planning and Development Department shall require that a jurisdictional determination be conducted in consultation with the state Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and/or the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) within proposed development areas deemed to be potentially classified as wetlands. It shall be the responsibility of the developer to obtain such a jurisdictional determination. 
(2)  During the platting of environmentally sensitive lands, the city will allow lot layout and setbacks to vary so that development can be clustered on the upland portions of the site. Any development occurring in wetlands areas must meet state and federal permitting requirements. 
(3)  Site plans for proposed development activity must identify the location and extent of jurisdictional wetlands and FEMA AE and V zones. 
(4)  Where the alteration of wetlands is necessary to allow for the reasonable use of the property, the site plans must provide measures to maintain the natural hydrology of the wetlands, such as constructing roadway and/or driveway culverts. 
(5)  In addition to the stormwater management requirements specified in Article 13, the applicable Best Management Practices identified by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, shall be utilized during all construction activity. 
(6)  The construction of any structure, whether for residential or other purposes, or any use which may in any way impair the flow of floodwater within a designated floodway are prohibited. 
C.  Vegetative buffer requirements. 
(1)  The city shall protect and conserve the natural functions of wetlands and waterbodies through wetland and shoreline protection buffers. The buffer width of wetland and shoreline protection buffers may vary depending upon such factors as slope, elevation and vegetation transition. The minimum required buffers shall be as follows: 
a.  For existing cleared commercial projects along rivers, streams and regulated wetlands, a minimum 15-foot buffer is to be provided. If there is a significant change to the project's scope of construction, development, or any considerable alteration of circumstance occurs relating to the current state and or use of the land, the buffer shall be increased to a 30-foot buffer of either natural or planted vegetation. Maintenance of the buffer shall be the sole responsibility of the land owner or lease holder. 
b.  For new commercial projects on undeveloped land located along rivers, streams and regulated wetlands, a minimum 30-foot natural vegetative buffer shall be provided. Thinning of the underbrush without disturbing the land will be allowed. The definition of underbrush and method of removal of the underbrush shall be as defined by FDEP and USACOE; 
c.  For existing cleared residential property the same requirements as subsection C(1)(a), above, shall apply with a minimum 15-foot buffer and the area between the rear building setback line and the buffer shall be stabilized and/or grassed; and 
d.  For residential development on undeveloped land, the same requirements as subsection C(1)b. of this section, except the area between the rear building setback line and the buffer shall be stabilized natural vegetation and/or grassed. 
(2)  Allowable development within wetlands and associated wetland buffers includes, piers, docks, elevated walkways, public picnic pavilions, public parks, gazebos, or structures approved and permitted by the FDEP and/or USACOE and an attendant 15-foot wide cleared path through the buffer for purposes of providing access to such structures. 
a.  Encroachments are also permitted for roads, utilities and recreational crossings, consistent with permits issued by regulatory agencies. 
i.  The number of such encroachments shall be minimized by collocation of utilities, roads and other crossings. 
b.  The wetlands protection buffer shall begin at the state Department of Environmental Protection agency or the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers jurisdictional line, whichever is more landward. 
c.  In the absence of wetlands along rivers and streams, a buffer extending landward of the mean or ordinary high-water line, as applicable, shall be required as specified in subsection (1)(a) of this section. 
d.  The buffer zones shall consist of preserved native vegetation, including canopy, understory and ground cover whenever possible. 
i.  If there is no native vegetation on the site, a planted vegetated buffer as indicated in subsection (1)(a) of this section shall be required as part of the site development. 
ii.  Variances to the buffer requirements shall only be granted when the strict application of the requirements limits all reasonable use of the property as allowed by the future land use map. All allowable development and encroachments shall limit impermeable surface area and shall utilize stormwater BMP's, indicated in Article 12, whenever possible. 
(3)  Where sufficient uplands exist to locate the proposed development in the upland portion of the site, the city may allow the transfer of development at the lesser of the future land use densities established on the future land use map, or the density established for the assigned zoning district in this Unified Development Code, from the wetland to the upland portion of the site. The transfer of density may occur provided all other plan provisions are satisfied regarding, but not limited to, upland and floodplain resource protection, compatibility of adjacent land use, stormwater management and setbacks. Transfer of development densities shall also satisfy the minimum lot size of the zoning district in which the lot is located. 
(4)  Any new lots created hereafter will have enough buildable upland area to accommodate the level of development appropriate for the designated land use, so that wetland-impacts can be avoided and appropriate buffers accommodated. 
a.  For lots existing prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, where sufficient upland does not exist to avoid a taking, development in the wetlands shall be restricted to allow the appropriate residential density use at the density of one dwelling unit per five acres. 
i.  In the event a parcel is less than five acres, a single-family dwelling will be allowed on each parcel, which existed prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived. 
b.  Single-family dwelling development on existing parcels which are permitted pursuant to this policy that cannot meet the buffer requirements, may be reduced proportionately with the parcel dimensions. 
c.  For lots existing prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, where sufficient depth of the uplands do not exist, to avoid a taking, development shall be restricted to a single-family dwelling subject to a reduced buffer. 
d.  A lot lacking sufficient depth means a lot that is 100 feet or less. Such lots shall be subject to a minimum buffer of 15 percent of the depth of the lot. The buffer should be supplemented with a fence to further protect the wetlands. Access to the river, stream or wetland shall be limited to a 15-foot swath, which shall be maintained in grass or other pervious material. 
11.2 - BLACKWATER RIVER PROTECTION 
A.  Intent. It is the intent of this article to provide specific development requirements to protect the Blackwater River, which is classified as an outstanding Florida water, to include its water quality and recreational resources. Furthermore, it is the intent of this article to protect the Blackwater River from encroachment by development activity. 
B.  Requirements. The following protective measures shall be required, as applicable, for any development activity occurring in the vicinity of the Blackwater River: 
(1)  Septic tank systems, including drain fields, shall be prohibited within 150 feet of the Blackwater River. New septic tanks shall only be allowed in areas with soil conditions classified by the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) Soil Survey for the county as acceptable for septic tank absorption fields; provided such systems are setback a minimum of 150 feet from the Blackwater River. Any remaining septic tank systems located within this 150-foot buffer shall be systematically converted to the central sanitary sewer system. 
(2)  Specific development setbacks of 30 feet from the Blackwater River shall be required for both principal and accessory structures, for permitted and special uses within any district. Boathouses, piers, and elevated walkways, pavilions, gazebos and other substantially similar structures shall be exempt from this provision. Any nonconformities resulting from the application of this article shall comply with the requirements of Article 10, Nonconformities. 
11.3. - POTABLE WATER WELLHEAD PROTECTION 
A.  Intent. It is the intent of this section to ensure the protection of the public potable water supply through the appropriate site of land uses in proximity to wellheads and adequate capping and/or securing of abandoned wellheads. 
B.  Development restrictions. 
(1)  Prohibited uses and development activities within the wellhead protection zone. Development activities shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and regional regulations; specifically, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the Northwest Florida Water Management District regulations governing allowable activities in proximity to wellheads. In order to protect water sources, including cones of influence, water recharge areas and water-wells, adverse land uses such as the following are prohibited within a wellhead protection zone: 
a.  Sanitary landfills; 
b.  Gasoline stations; 
c.  Wastewater treatment facilities; or 
d.  Other land uses which utilize, store or handle toxic or hazardous materials. 
(2)  Special restrictions on development allowed within the wellhead protection zone. 
a.  Stormwater management practices shall not include drainage wells for stormwater disposal where recharge is into potable water aquifers. Additional stormwater management requirements are specified in Article 13. 
b.  Where prohibited uses and development are proposed in areas with existing protected wells, these wells shall be abandoned, including adequate sealing, plugging and abandonment, according to F.A.C. Ch. 62-528. 
11.4 - HISTORICAL RESOURCE PROTECTION 
A.  Intent. The intent of this section shall be to: 
(1)  Establish a historic preservation board; 
(2)  Identify regulated historic structures; 
(3)  Set forth requirements for the protection and preservation of regulated structures; 
(4)  Define a process for review and appeals; and 
(5)  Encourage the listing of additional properties as historic structures. 
B.  Historic preservation board. 
(1)  Established; membership. 
a.  Composition. The Milton Historic Preservation Board is hereby established by the city council. Any restoration or alteration of regulated historic structures will be presented to the board for review and issuance of a certificate of appropriateness prior to the issuance of a development order or building permit by the development approval authority. The board shall be composed of seven members who are city residents and/or persons who own property within the city, appointed by the city council considering the following: 
i.  A demonstrated interest in historic preservation; 
ii.  A professional mix that provides for expertise in the fields of architecture, planning, engineering, law, or finance, to the extent reasonable and possible; and 
iii.  Representation of the community at-large. 
The board shall be provided staff support through the Planning and Development Department for the city. 
b.  Terms; vacancies, removal. Members shall be appointed for a term of four years, except in the case of an appointment to fill a vacancy for the four-year period in which event the appointment shall be for the unexpired term only. Any member of the board may be removed from office by the city council in a regular meeting. 
c.  Officers. The board shall elect from among its members a chairman and vice-chairman. 
(2)  Duties and procedures. 
a.  Purpose. The board shall have as its purpose the preservation and protection of buildings of historic significance. It shall be the board's duty to act upon plans for the alteration, renovation, or restoration of regulated historic structures to ensure conformance with the U.S. Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. During the review process, the board shall also consider conformance to the development guidelines established for the city historic district. 
b.  Plan submission procedure. 
i.  Required. Every application for development approval to alter, renovate, or restore a regulated historic building located in the historic district or buildings listed on the National Register which are located outside the historic district, shall be required to submit plans for the proposed work in sufficient detail to allow for review by the board. 
ii.  Plans defined; certificate of appropriateness. Plans for renovations to nonregulated historic properties may, at the owner's election, be submitted for review by the historic preservation board in order to obtain a certificate of appropriateness. As used herein, the term "plans" means drawings or sketches with sufficient elevations to show the architectural design of the building (both before and after the proposed work is done in the case of altering or renovating a building or structure), including proposed materials, textures and colors, and the site plan or site layout, site improvements of features such as walls, walks, terraces, landscaping, that meet the requirements of subsection 11.4(D), accessory buildings, signs, lights and other appurtenances. 
iii.  Board meeting; notice. Such plans shall be submitted to the Planning and Development Department, who will forward such plans to the historic preservation board. Upon submittal of an application for development approval to the Planning and Development Department, the applicant for any proposed development found to be under the jurisdiction of the historic preservation board, shall be notified of the time, date and place of the board's meeting. The applicant or authorized agent is encouraged to appear at the meeting at which the request is being considered by the board to review the alteration, renovation or restoration of the regulated historic structure which is under consideration. 
c.  Review and decision. The board shall promptly review such plans and make a determination as to conformance with the Secretary of the U. S. Department of Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. 
d.  Notification; building permit. If the board finds the plans in conformance with the requirements of this section, a certificate of appropriateness will be issued. If the board does not find the plans in conformance, the applicant may resubmit plans to the board with the necessary changes, as specified by the board in its finding of nonconformance. 
e.  Voting. Decisions may be rendered when a quorum is present, by a simple majority of the board members present and voting. 
C.  Standards for rehabilitation of historic structures. The Secretary of Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Regulated Historic Buildings and the City of Milton's Pattern Book are hereby adopted as review guidelines for the rehabilitation of regulated historic structures located within the city historic district, and those listed at the National Register, but located outside the historic district. 
D.  Supplementary design review regulations. 
(1)  In the historic district, where a characteristic development pattern and distinctive architectural style have already been established, new development shall be planned to reinforce this special character. The early 1900's architectural style is the established theme for the historic district. In issuing land use certificates, the downtown redevelopment board shall review development plans, including exterior facades and sign construction and renovation, for conformance with the guidelines established in this section. 
(2)  The adoption of guidelines herein are intended to provide flexibility in the development of property within the district in a manner which balances the interest of the property owner with the public's need for assurance that development will be orderly and aesthetically compatible with neighboring structures and historic resources. 
(3)  Each development proposal within the historic district will be reviewed by the Community Redevelopment Agency and/or the Historic Preservation Board based upon the following guidelines: 
a.  Site planning. The historic character of the district shall be reflected as closely as possible in the site planning of new development. Site planning should also respect the precedents set by other buildings on a block. For example, the placement of new buildings on a lot should correspond to the setbacks, orientation, and spacing of adjacent buildings to ensure maximum consistency and compatibility of the overall streetscape. 
b.  Architecture. The early 1900's architectural theme is hereby established for the city historic district. The scale, height, massing, materials, textures, and colors of new buildings shall be compatible with those of existing structures to which such new construction or renovation is visually related. Architectural details which are similar to the details of adjacent existing buildings will have a unifying effect and are encouraged. 
c.  Landscaping. Landscaping and tree protection within the district shall be regulated in accordance with Article 12. New landscaping should be consistent with the existing landscape character of the district. Courtyard and sidewalk paving material shall be consistent with the neighboring areas. The use of brick as a paving material is encouraged. Walls and fences shall be consistent with the approved fencing materials. Where common or centralized solid waste containers are proposed, such facilities shall be screened with vegetation, fencing or other appropriate materials. 
d.  Fences. Subsection 9.3(N) controls. 
e.  Signs. Signs in the historic district shall be regulated in accordance with Article 16 and with the following specific requirements, or as otherwise approved by the development approval authority. 
i.  On residential structures, one non-illuminated name plate designating the name of the occupant of the property and other historical information of significance is allowed. The name plate should not be larger than 100 square inches and may be attached to the building or be freestanding. 
ii.  Sign patterns and colors have been established for use in the historic district. Sign patterns shall be colonial design, semi-custom sign patterns, or the equivalent. Sign colors include those specified in subsection D(4) for structures. 
iii.  Portable signs mounted on a trailer-type vehicle, and specifically designed to be temporary in nature are prohibited in the historic district. 
iv.  Within the historic district, signs projecting into or overhanging the public right-of-way are permitted subject to approval by the development approval authority, and are subject to removal on 30 days' notice if the city requires the space for any public purpose. Such signs shall be consistent with other sign criteria for the district and must be of a character and size consistent with the historic theme. Approval shall also be required for the hanging mount. 
v.  If the sign is to project over the state department of transportation's right-of-way (Caroline Street), approval would also be required of that agency prior to city approval. 
vi.  All other criteria will be regulated in accordance with Article 16. 
(4)  Exterior structure colors. Historic period colors have been established for buildings in the historic district. These colors include, but are not limited to, Heritage Colors (authentic exterior colors for American buildings (1820-1920 by Sherwin Williams), or equivalent historic period colors by other paint brands. 
E.  Incentives for preservation. 
(1)  Substantial rehabilitation (50 percent or greater of appraised value) of structures in flood zones is normally restricted; however, if a property is listed as significant on the Florida Master Site File, National Register, or by local designation, the restriction does not apply. 
(2)  Owners of historic structures may petition the board of adjustment for a special exception for use, regardless of the zoning district. This allows buildings in residential districts to convert to office uses if the board of adjustment determines that the use is not injurious to the character of the neighborhood. 
(3)  For designated properties, variances to parking requirements, lot size or other zoning requirements may be requested from the board of adjustment without proving a hardship. It must be shown that the granting of the variance will not injure the public health and safety of the area. Filing these types of petitions usually carries a fee, but this is waived for regulated historic structures. 
F.  Appeals. Decisions of the historic preservation board may be appealed to the city council, sitting as the community redevelopment agency as provided for in Article 3. 
( Ord. No. 1455-17 , § 1, 8-8-2017) 
11.5 - ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCE PROTECTION 
A.  Intent. It is the intent of this section to provide for the protection of archaeologically significant resources within the city's jurisdiction. 
B.  Requirement for construction activity. In the event that a proposed development plan has been identified by the Planning and Development Department to be in the vicinity of an archaeologically significant site, the department shall require the owner to alert construction personnel in regards to this information. If at any time, a potentially significant archaeological site or artifact is uncovered during the development process, the owner shall notify the city. The city shall contact and consult with the University of West Florida, Office of Cultural and Archaeological Research and/or other appropriate state officials to determine the significance of the resource and identify the need for mitigation measures. 
11.6 - TREE PROTECTION 
A.  Heritage tree preservation. 
(1)  Heritage trees shall be preserved within the city, unless removal is mitigated as set forth below. All land uses shall comply with the requirements of this section. Heritage trees, determined to be dead and/or diseased to a point beyond recovery by a certified arborist shall be exempted from the following requirements. 
a.  Protective measures during construction activity shall be afforded to heritage trees consistent with the requirements contained in subsection 11.6(B)(8). 
b.  Any application to remove a heritage tree shall specify the location and size of such tree and detail the reasons necessitating its removal. Such applications shall be reviewed and acted upon by the Planning and Development Department. 
B.  Protected Trees. 
(1)  Intent. It is the intent of this section to: 
a.  Provide for the preservation of protected trees; 
b.  Help preserve the environment's ecological balance; 
c.  Reduce heat and glare; and 
d.  Reduce the degrading effects of thermal pollution and storm water runoff. It is not the intent of this section to prevent the cutting of trees for agricultural purposes. 
e.  Protected trees shall be preserved within the city unless removal is mitigated as set forth below. 
(2)  Applicability. This section shall apply to all land area and districts, excepting single-family and duplex residential uses and agricultural uses. 
(3)  Exemptions. The following trees are exempt from the provisions of this section: 
a.  Any tree located within utility easements and public rights-of-ways; which endanger the public safety and/or welfare; which interferes with utility service; which is required by a local, state or federal agency; or which is required to be removed to qualify for state or federal financial aid. 
(4)  Powerline easements. The development approval authority may grant a waiver from the requirements of this section to the extent necessary to prevent interference with power company access on or to utility easements; provided that such waiver does not allow the unnecessary destruction or removal of heritage trees as defined above. 
(5)  Emergency exemptions. During emergency conditions caused by a hurricane or other natural disaster, the provisions of this section may be suspended by direction of the City Manager or mayor until the end of the emergency period. Notice of such emergency suspension shall be posted at city hall and in a newspaper of local circulation. 
(6)  Permit required; contents. No person shall cut down, destroy, remove, relocate or destructively damage or cause to be cut down, destroyed, removed, relocated or destructively damaged any protected tree without first obtaining a permit from the city as herein provided. The information to be provided by the owner shall include: 
a.  The number, species, size and location of the affected protected tree; and 
b.  A brief statement of the reasons for the requested action. 
(7)  Application. A permit application for the removal of a protected tree shall be made to the Planning and Development Department. Such application shall only be approved if one of the following conditions exists, as determined by the zoning coordinator. 
a.  A site plan submitted by the applicant shows that a proposed structure, permissible under all applicable laws and regulations, can be situated on a subject parcel only if specific protected trees are removed or relocated; 
b.  The protected tree is located in such proximity to existing or proposed structures that the utility or structural integrity of such structures is materially impaired; 
c.  The protected tree materially interferes with the location, servicing or functioning of public utility lines or service; and 
d.  The protected tree obstructs views of oncoming ground traffic or otherwise creates a substantial hazard to such traffic, or where the removal of the protected tree is necessary to comply with state and federal requirements or is necessary to obtain state or federal financial assistance. 
(8)  Protection during construction. 
a.  During development activities, protected trees shall be safeguarded from activities which may injure or kill them. 
b.  At least 50 percent of the area within the drip line or the area within ten feet of the tree trunk, whichever is greater, shall be preserved in a natural state or provided with pervious landscaping. Within this area the soil shall be maintained at its original grade with no trenching or cutting of roots allowed. Any land clearing activities done in this area shall be done by hand. Beyond ten feet of the tree trunk and within the drip line, a light fill of porous gravelly material up to six inches deep may be added but no grade lowering shall occur. To accomplish deeper filling a drainage system shall be installed within the area defined in the drip line of the tree and a drywall shall be constructed at a distance at least ten feet from the trunk of the tree before gravel and porous fill are added. 
c.  Within the drip line there shall be no storage of fill or soil compaction as from heavy equipment, or any spilling, storage, or disposal of concrete, mortar, paint, solvents, chemicals, or other potentially harmful substances. 
d.  All trees to be protected shall be staked or fenced and conspicuously flagged throughout the construction process. A minimum of 50 percent of the area within the drip line and/or the area within ten feet of the tree trunk, whichever is greater, shall be staked and conspicuously flagged. 
(9)  Review. 
a.  Permit applications for the removal of protected trees, including heritage trees, shall be made to the Planning and Development Department. The department shall have ten working days in which to review the site plan and permit application, and make a determination as to whether the proposed removal of the protected tree is consistent with the provisions of this section. Upon a finding that the site plan and permit application is consistent with the provisions of this section, a city development permit shall be issued. 
b.  Upon finding that the site plan and permit is inconsistent with the provisions of this section, the Planning and Development Department shall notify the applicant in writing as to what action must be taken to conform the site plan and permit application to the requirements of this section. 
c.  Additional requirements and review may apply within the Historic District and Community Redevelopment Areas. 
(10)  Mitigation requirements. 
a.  All trees not considered heritage or protected, based on species or diameter, must be relocated or replaced on a two for one basis (two replacement trees for each removed) within all land uses and districts with the exception of single family and duplex uses. Heritage and Protected trees shall be replaced with an additional replacement tree required for every two-inch gain in diameter over the protected or heritage size threshold as specified in 8.6(A) above. 
i.  Species recognized as an "invasive" exotic and those whose health is confirmed to be "fair" or worse as determined by the city's planning department working in conjunction with a certified arborist shall be exempt from mitigation. 
b.  Where it is not possible to plant replacement trees onsite, tree impacts shall be offset by contributing to a mitigation fund used to plant new trees or for green-space enhancement projects in appropriate locations throughout the community. When every effort to incorporate existing trees into designs is exhausted and there is still not ample room within the project site for all of the required replacement plantings, the offsite mitigation fee shall be calculated using the formula found herein with a value of $250.00 per replacement tree. (For example, a four-inch diameter tree that is replaced 2:1 would require a fee of $250.00 × 2 = $500.00, while a 39-inch diameter heritage tree would be replaced 4:1 equal to $250.00 × 4 = $1,000.00.) These values shall be used when seeking a tree removal permit. Unauthorized tree removal is prohibited and shall increase the required mitigation twice the rate applied to authorized removals. The table below provides the value of offsite mitigation fees including heritage trees.

C.  Tree Planting and Preservation-Off-Street Parking Areas. The requirements of this section shall be in addition to the requirements of all other applicable sections of these regulations. 
(1)  Intent. It is the intent of this subsection to provide for tree preservation and planting in off-street, paved parking areas and other development, to help preserve the ecological balance of the environment, to reduce heat and glare, to provide a buffer from street noise and incompatible land uses, and to reduce the degrading effects of thermal pollution and/or stormwater runoff. 
(2)  Applicability. The following requirements shall apply to all land uses and districts within the city, with the exception of single-family and duplex residential and agricultural uses. 
a.  Tree planting. Any expansion of paved areas constructed or undertaken after the adoption of the ordinance from which these regulations are derived shall require the planting of a minimum of one tree, for each additional 1,000 square feet of pervious paved area or fraction thereof and three trees for each additional 1,000 square feet of impervious paved area or fraction thereof. 
i.  The tree planting areas shall have the minimum width necessary to support the future growth of the specific tree planted. In no case, shall such width be less than width of the surrounding parking spaces if an island or less than 5 feet wide if provided elsewhere.

ARTICLE 12. - LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS 

12.1 - GENERAL REQUIREMENTS 
A.  Intent. It is the intent of this Article to establish regulations for the placement of landscaping and trees within the city, in order to better control problems associated with flooding, soil conservation, air and noise pollution, and to make the city a healthier, safer and more beautiful place in which to live. It is further the intent of this section to establish landscaping requirements for all off-street parking areas and other developed areas. Justifications for such requirements include the following: 
(1)  To aid in controlling vehicular and pedestrian traffic in parking areas; 
(2)  To enhance the community's ecological and aesthetic qualities; and 
(3)  To protect and enhance property values. 
B.  General Requirements. 
(1)  New Development on any parcel of land in any district, except for the construction of residential structures containing two dwelling units or less (unless a part of a larger planned development), and Redevelopment or a Change in Use which increases intensity or requires additional parking, are required to meet the following Open Space, Landscaping, and Screening Standards: 
a.  Generally, detention and retention ponds shall not qualify as landscape or open space area. However, retention and detention ponds less than three feet in depth may qualify as landscaped and open space area; provided that fencing requirements do not apply. 
b.  The total number of parking spaces required by this Unified Development Code may be reduced as determined by the appropriate development approval authority, to the extent necessary to comply with this section. 
(2)  Care of trees on public property. It shall be the City Manager's responsibility to administer a plan for the care, preservation, pruning, planting, replanting, removal, or disposition of trees and shrubs in parks, along streets, and in all other public areas. 
12.2 - LANDSCAPE PLAN REQUIRED 
    A landscape plan is required as part of a site plan review application for multi-family, and non-residential (including mixed-use) development, and planned development projects. The landscape plan must be approved prior to the issuance of a building permit. Landscape plans must be prepared by a landscape architect or civil engineer licensed in Florida. 
A.  Contents of the Landscape Plan. Landscape plans must contain a scale drawing showing and a description of the following: 
(1)  The location and dimensions of all existing and proposed structures, property lines, easements, parking lots and drives, rights-of-way, refuse disposal and recycling areas, pedestrian and bicycle paths, fences, mechanical equipment, overhead utility wires, retention/detention facilities, and other drainage facilities, such as drainage swales. 
(2)  The location, quantity, size, name, and condition, both botanical and common, of all existing plant materials on-site, indicating plant material to be retained and to be removed. All protected and heritage trees must be specifically identified on the plan. 
(3)  The location, quantity, size, and name, both botanical and common, of all proposed plant material. 
(4)  The existing and proposed grading of the site indicating contours at one foot intervals. Proposed berming must also be indicated using one foot contour intervals. 
(5)  Elevations of all proposed fences, stairs, and retaining walls. 
(6)  A certified irrigation-sprinkler plan. Plans including only those species identified as native and drought resistant and which do not require irrigation or watering in addition to what occurs naturally in this region, as verified by a landscape or civil engineer, shall not require a certified irrigation-sprinkler plan in lieu of submittal of a certified letter from the landscape or civil engineer to include a statement that the species identified in the plan shall not require irrigation or watering in addition to what naturally occurs in the region. 
(7)  Any other details as determined necessary by the reviewing body. 
B.  Minor Changes to Approved Landscape Plans. Minor changes to the landscape plan that do not result in a reduction in the net amount of plant material as specified on the approved landscape plan may be approved by the Planning Director. Major changes must be approved by the body granting approval of the landscape plan initially. 
12.3 - LANDSCAPE DESIGN STANDARDS 
A.  Selection of Plant Materials. 
(1)  Plant materials must be selected from the approved plant palette found on the Florida Friendly Plant List within the Florida-Friendly Landscaping Guide to Plant Selection and Landscape Design as adopted and incorporated herein by reference. The Planning Director may approve plants not included in the list if the species are native or naturalized to the area, and capable of withstanding the seasonal temperature variations of the City of Milton, as well as the individual site microclimate. 
(2)  The overall composition and location of landscaping shall complement the scale of the development and its surroundings. In general, larger, well-placed contiguous planting areas shall be preferred to smaller, disconnected areas. Where screening is required by this section, it shall be at least three feet in height, unless otherwise specified. Required screening shall be at least 50 percent opaque throughout the year. 
(3)  All plant materials must be of good quality and meet the most current American Standard for Nursery Stock (ANSI Z60.1) published by the American Association of Nurseryman and approved by the American National Standards Institute, standards for minimum acceptable form, quality, and size for species selected. Size and density of plant material, both at the time of planting and at maturity, are additional criteria that must be considered when selecting plant material. 
a.  Minimum plant size shall be as specified in the landscape plan in keeping with the general guidelines found in the following table. 
Table 12.3.1. Plant Type and Size Requirements 
Plant Type Minimum Size at Planting Broad Leaf Evergreen 6 feet in height; 3 in. DBH Evergreen tree (conifer) 6 feet in height; 3 in. DBH Deciduous canopy tree 4 inches caliper at DBH Small deciduous tree 1 inches caliper at DBH Evergreen or deciduous shrubs 18-24 inches in height Large Shrub 36 inches in height  
b.  Landscape materials shall be tolerant of specific site conditions. 
c.  Existing healthy plant material may be utilized to satisfy landscaping requirements; provided it meets the minimum plant size specified in this section. 
d.  Landscape materials that are used for screening shall be of a size that allows growth to the desired height and opacity within one year. 
e.  For the purposes of this Code, where shade trees are required, broad-leaf evergreens are considered a shade tree. 
f.  Large shrubs are those shrubs that reach five or more feet in height at maturity. Small shrubs are those shrubs that may grow up to five feet in height if left unmaintained, but are generally maintained at heights of 18 to 36 inches. 
(4)  Low impact site design and Xeriscape design practices, such as preserving existing native trees and vegetation, shall be used where appropriate and feasible. 
(5)  Where appropriate, the use of drought tolerant plant material is preferred. 
(6)  Additional requirements and review may apply within the Historic District and Community Redevelopment Areas. 
(7)  The term "invasive plant species" includes those plants that grow quickly and aggressively, spreading and displacing other plants. Examples of invasive plant species include, but are not limited to, Kudzu vine and Chinese tallow. Plant materials shall comply with the following standards: 
(8)  All landscape materials must be installed in accordance with the current planting procedures established by the American Association of Nurserymen. All plant materials must be free of disease and installed so that soil of sufficient volume, composition, and nutrient balance are available to sustain healthy growth. Installation of plant materials during the appropriate growing season is encouraged. 
B.  Irrigation System Design Standards. 
(1)  Irrigation systems shall be designed to meet the needs of the plants in the landscape. 
(2)  When feasible, irrigation systems shall be designed to separately serve turf and non-turf areas. 
(3)  The Landscape plans and specifications shall identify the materials to be used and the construction methods. 
(4)  The design shall consider soil, slope, and other site characteristics in order to minimize water waste, including overspray, the watering of impervious surfaces, and other non-vegetated areas, and off-site runoff. 
(5)  The system shall be designed to minimize free flow conditions in case of damage or other mechanical failure. 
(6)  The system shall be designed to use the lowest quality water feasible. 
(7)  Rain switches or other devices, such as soil moisture sensors, to prevent unnecessary irrigation, shall be incorporated. 
C.  Species Diversity. Diversity among required plant material is mandatory for visual interest and to reduce the risk of losing a large population of plants due to disease. Table 12.3.3: Diversity Requirements, indicates the percentage of diversity required based on the total quantity of species being used. For example, if a development requires 45 shade trees, no more than 18 trees (40%) and no less than five trees (10%) can be of one species, and there must be a minimum of five different species within the 45 trees. When the calculation of plant diversity requirements results in a fraction, said fraction is rounded up. 
Table 12.3.3. Diversity Requirements. 
Total Number of Plants Per Plant Types Maximum Amount of One Species Minimum Amount of One Species Minimum Number of Species 1-4 100% N/A 1 5-10 60% 40% 2 11-15 45% 20% 3 16-75 40% 10% 5 76-500 25% 5% 8 500-1,000 30% 5% 10 1,000+ 15% 4% 15  
D.  Maintenance. 
(1)  Landscape material depicted on approved landscape plans is considered a required site element in the same manner as structures, parking, lighting, and other improvements. As such, the property owner is responsible for the maintenance, repair, and replacement of all landscape material, fences, walls, steps, retaining walls, and similar landscape elements. 
(2)  All landscape material must be maintained in good condition, present a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance, and be kept free of refuse and debris. Any dead, unhealthy, or missing plants must be replaced within 60 days.

13.2 - EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROLS 
A.  Introduction and Purpose. 
(1)  During the construction process, soil is the most vulnerable to erosion by wind and water. This eroded soil endangers water resources by reducing water quality, and causing the siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other desirable species. Eroded soil also necessitates the repair of sewers and ditches, and the dredging of lakes. In addition, clearing grading during construction causes the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat, and to provide a healthy living environment for the citizens of the city. 
(2)  As a result, the purpose of this local regulation is to safeguard persons, protect property, prevent damage to the environment and promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating, and controlling the design, construction, use, and maintenance of any development or other activity which disturbs or breaks the topsoil or results in the movement of earth on land in the city. 
B.  Permits. 
(1)  No person shall be granted a site development permit for land disturbing activity, without the city's approval of an erosion and sediment control plan. Land disturbing activities of one acre or more require a NPDES permit issued by FDEP. 
(2)  No site development permit is required for the following activities: 
a.  Any emergency activity that is immediately necessary for the protection of life, property or natural resources. 
b.  Existing nursery and agricultural operations conducted as a permitted main or accessory use. 
(3)  Permit submittal. 
a.  Each application shall bear the name and address of the owner or developer of the site, and of any consulting firm retained by the applicant together with the name of the applicant's principal contact at such firm, shall be accompanied by a filing fee and completed on a form acceptable to the city.

(11)  Construction certification by registered professional. 
a.  For any sites that required a professional site plan, a certification letter shall be submitted after soil erosion and stormwater runoff control facilities have been installed to affirm that the construction has been completed in accordance with the approved soil erosion and stormwater runoff control plan. This certification letter can be prepared by one of the following registered professionals: 
i.  Civil engineer; 
ii.  Land surveyor; 
iii.  Architect; or 
iv.  Landscape architect, 
Unless it was specified by the planning and development director that a civil engineer prepare the initial plan, then the certification would need to be the civil engineer that prepared the plan. 
b.  If there are changes during the course of construction, the planning and development director may require final "as-built" drawings for final approval of the site work. 
(12)  Certificate of compliance. Upon receipt and approval of the certification letter, the planning and development director shall issue a notice of compliance to the property owner. 
(13)  Finished floor elevation. 
a.  Minimum finished habitable floor elevations (excluding basements) shall be eight inches above finished grade. If no sod is installed, the elevation shall be ten inches above finished grade. The finished grade shall be sloped downward from the foundation 21/2 inches within ten feet or less including sidewalks, patios and driveways and then sloped a minimum 1/16 inch per foot to a positive drainage outfall. 
b.  In all new subdivisions a sealed professional engineer's evaluation shall be required. The engineer's evaluation will include design data; calculations, drawings and applicable assumptions to establish the 100-year water surface profile for the area and shall be submitted to the city engineer. Upon review by the city engineer, a minimum finished habitable floor elevation of 14 inches above the expected 100-year water surface profile will be established and forwarded to the city Planning and Development Department where required. 
c.  In areas determined by the city to be flood-prone with documented high-water elevations, a minimum finished habitable floor elevation of 18 inches above the high-water mark will be established by the city engineer. The finished floor elevation requirements shall be verified prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy by a certified elevation letter from a registered land surveyor or registered engineer. 
These regulations are adopted to attempt to reduce flooding to habitable areas of single-family residences. It is recognized that no regulation will guarantee that such flooding will not occur. These regulations shall not be construed to impose any duty or liability against the city in relation to the enforcement of these regulations or in relation to any flooding which may occur. 
(14)  Inspections. 
a.  Authorized city representatives may enter at reasonable times upon any property to conduct on-site inspections. Such inspections may take place before, during, and after any earth change activity for which a permit has been issued. 
b.  If upon inspection, existing site conditions are found not to be as stated in the permit or approved soil erosion, stormwater runoff control plan, or the stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP), the city permit will be invalid. No earth disrupting work shall be undertaken, or continued, until revised plans have been submitted and a valid permit issued. 
c.  Requests for revisions must be submitted to and approved by the planning and development director, in writing, before being effective, unless approved by the city field inspector on the site. If approved, a revised site plan shall be submitted for review and approval. 
(15)  Stop work orders and emergency actions. 
a.  If necessary to ensure compliance with the permit requirements, standards, and other provisions of these regulations, or to protect the public health, safety and welfare, a city employee who is a state-certified stormwater inspector may issue a stop work order for the purpose of preventing or minimizing accelerated soil erosion, stormwater runoff, or other conditions posing imminent and substantial danger to public health, safety, welfare, or natural resources. 
b.  If necessary to protect public safety or water resources, including lakes, streams, protected wetlands, and other receiving bodies of water, a city employee who is a state-certified stormwater inspector may, but shall not be required to, initiate emergency action to abate imminent and substantial danger and risk, subject to these regulations. No duty or liability of the city is created by this provision. 
c.  Except as otherwise provided through maintenance agreements, the property owner may be held responsible for reimbursing the city for all costs incurred as a result of any emergency action, including administrative costs; provided that a finding is made that the property owner violated the provisions of these regulations, a permit, or an approved maintenance agreement, subject to these regulations. 
d.  The stop work order, when issued, may require all specified earth changing activities to be stopped. A copy of the stop work order may immediately be submitted to other state and local agencies with regulatory jurisdiction. 
e.  If a city employed state-certified stormwater inspector determines that soil erosion and sedimentation of the waters of this city has or will reasonably occur from a parcel of land in violation of these regulations, the city may seek to enforce these regulations by notifying the person who owns the land, by mail, with return receipt requested, of the city determination. The notice may contain a description of the specific soil and sedimentation control measures which, if implemented by the property owner, would bring the owner into compliance. At a minimum, this may include the maintenance of a grassed yard on all single-family home sites and at all commercial/industrial developments.

13.5 - INSPECTIONS 
    The following types of inspections shall be conducted by the city staff in order to ensure that stormwater management is accomplished in accordance with this section: 
A.  Initial inspection. The purpose of the initial inspection is to verify the site-related information in the proposed stormwater management plan and to note any potential problems related to stormwater management or the control of erosion and sedimentation. The initial inspection shall be required prior to the approval of any stormwater management plan. The city manager or his designee, however, may waive the requirement for an initial inspection for a small residential development submitting a stormwater management plan pursuant to subsections 13.1 and 13.3. 
B.  Erosion control inspection. The purpose of the erosion control inspection is to ensure that the proper erosion and sedimentation controls have been installed in accordance with subsection 13.2 and the developments approved stormwater management plan. The erosion control inspection is applicable to all developments, which are not exempt from implementing erosion and sedimentation controls, and should be scheduled prior to the development activity, but after the erosion and sedimentation controls have been installed. Additionally, inspections may be required after the development activity is completed in order to ensure that vegetation is being reestablished. 
C.  Final inspection. The purpose of the final inspection is to ensure that the stormwater management system has been designed and constructed in accordance with the approved stormwater management plan. All developments required to submit a stormwater management plan shall be subject to a final inspection. Any significant inconsistencies between the stormwater management system and the approved stormwater management plan shall constitute a violation of these regulations and shall be subject to the enforcement provisions contained in Subsection 13.2(F). 
13.6 - PERVIOUS PAVEMENT SYSTEMS 
A.  Approved Pervious Pavement System Guidelines. 
(1)  Approved permeable pavements are considered on-site stormwater management practices and should have the same or very similar effectiveness with regards to the reduction of the volume and rate of stormwater runoff if properly installed. 
(2  Installation shall be completed to system design specifications by trained and experienced producers and construction contractors. 
a.  Porous concrete, porous asphalt, and permeable pavers should all have similar underlying storage and support structures. 
(3)  Installation of permeable pavement systems shall require diversion of runoff away from the installed surface until stabilization of the adjacent disturbed soils. 
Table 13.6.1. Approved Pervious Pavements and Systems 
Porous Asphalt Bituminous Asphalt without the fines with additional additives and binders. Porous Concrete Concrete with reduced fines in the mix. Permeable Paver Systems Interlocking concrete, plastic and other units with openings typically filled with gravel Reinforced Turf Systems Interlocking concrete, plastic and other units with openings typically filled with soil or other growth medium for the development of turf grass. Artificial, or Synthetic Turf Systems A water permeable surface of synthetic fibers. Other Systems  
B.  Considerations. 
(1)  Advantages of Pervious Pavement. 
a.  Can be used in place of traditional paved surfaces. 
b.  Can fit into spaces of almost any size and be integrated into many different site layouts. 
c.  Can be used as an alternative to traditional hardscape surfaces. 
d.  Reduces ponding that can be associated with traditional hardscape surfaces. 
e.  Provides ancillary benefits such as better conditions for trees, reduced heat island effect, quieter vehicular traffic, and reduced vehicular glare compared to standard asphalt. 
(2)  Limitations of Pervious Pavement. 
a.  Requires special consideration if used for high traffic loading areas or on heavy industrial sites where vehicles or equipment may contribute heavy sediment or gross pollutant loads to porous surfaces. 
b.  Typically not suitable for steep slope applications. 
c.  Requires frequent maintenance with specialized equipment to maintain performance. 
d.  May degrade more rapidly if located in areas with frequent vehicular turning. 
(3)  Design Considerations for Pervious Pavement. 
a.  Design of paving sections must consider system stability based on anticipated structural loading. 
b.  For systems that accept runoff from adjacent impervious and pervious areas, pretreatment will help to prevent clogging of porous surfaces. 
c.  Porous pavement should not be used in areas where gasoline or other hazardous materials may be dispensed or handled. 
C.  Installation Guidelines. 
(1)  The thickness of the pervious concrete or asphalt layer is dependent upon use, site, and design. Although manufacture specifications should always be followed with installation, the typical base for a pervious concrete, asphalt, or paver system shall generally consist of the following: 
a.  Choke course-This permeable layer is typically 1-2 inches thick and provides a level bed for the pervious concrete. It consists of small-sized, open-graded aggregate. 
b.  Open-graded base reservoir-This aggregate layer is immediately beneath the choke layer. The base is typically 3-4 inches thick and consists of crushed stones typically 3/4 to 3/16 inch. Besides storing water, this high infiltration rate layer provides a transition between the bedding and subbase layers. 
c.  Open-graded subbase reservoir-The stone sizes are larger than the base, typically 21/2 to 3/4 inch stone. Like the base layer, water is stored in the spaces among the stones. The subbase layer thickness depends on water storage requirements and traffic loads. A subbase layer may not be required in pedestrian or residential driveway applications. 
d.  Underdrain (optional)-In instances where pervious concrete is installed over low-infiltration rate soils, an underdrain facilitates water removal from the base and subbase. The underdrain is perforated pipe that ties into an outlet structure. Supplemental storage can be achieved by using a system of perforated pipes in the aggregate layers. 
e.  Geotextile (optional)-This can be used to separate the subbase from the subgrade and prevent the migration of soil into the aggregate subbase or base. 
f.  Subgrade-The layer of soil immediately beneath the aggregate base or subbase. 
D.  Maintenance Guidelines. 
(1)  If an approved pervious pavement system is proposed for a project the area of coverage shall be considered based on the design specifications at a rate no greater than what is identified in Article 2.2(H). 
(2)  Sub-surface soil testing must demonstrate that the manufacture's specifications will be met to allow for percolations and other functions. 
(3)  Design. 
a.  Cleanouts, manholes, access panels and other access features must be provided to allow unobstructed and safe access for routine maintenance and inspection of inflow, outflow, underdrains, and storage systems. 
b.  Observation wells must be provided for storage systems that include stone storage and must meet the following requirements: 
i.  The observation well must be placed at the invert of the stone bed. 
ii.  An observation well must be located near the center of the stone bed system to monitor the level and duration of water stored within the system (drain down time). 
iii.  Adequate inspection and maintenance access to the observation well must be provided. 
c.  A manhole may be used in lieu of an observation well if the invert of the manhole is installed at or below the bottom of the system and the manhole is configured in such a way that stormwater can flow freely between the system and the manhole at the systems invert. 
(4)  Access features for underground storage systems. 
a.  Access features must be provided for all underground storage systems that are not stone storage beds. 
b.  A sufficient number of access points in the system must be provided to efficiently inspect and maintain the storage area. 
c.  For cast-in-place vault systems, access features must consist of manholes or grated access panels or doors. Grated access panels are preferred to maintain airflow. 
d.  For grid storage or other manufactured systems, follow the manufacturer's recommendations. 
e.  Ladder access is required for vaults greater than four feet in height. 
f.  Header pipes, at minimum 36-inch diameter, connected to manholes at each corner of the subsurface system must be provided. Alternatively, smaller header pipes may be used if cleanouts are provided on every second manifold pipe/header pipe junction, on alternating sides, of the system. 
13.7 - ILLICIT DISCHARGE AND CONNECTION 
A.  Purpose and intent. The purpose of these regulations is to provide for the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city through the regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage system to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal and state law. These regulations establish the methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) in order to comply with the requirements of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process. The objectives of these regulations are: 
(1)  To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) by stormwater discharges by any user; 
(2)  To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system; and 
(3)  To establish the legal authority to carry out all inspection, surveillance and monitoring procedures necessary to ensure compliance with these regulations; 
B.  Applicability. These regulations shall apply to all influents; liquid and solid, including water entering the storm drain system generated on any developed and undeveloped lands, unless explicitly exempted by an authorized enforcement agency. 
C.  Responsibility for administration. The city shall provide qualified staff to administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of these regulations. The powers granted and duties imposed upon the authorized enforcement person or entities acting in the beneficial interest of or in the employ of the city shall be authorized by the city manager. 
D.  Ultimate responsibility. The standards set forth herein and promulgated pursuant to these regulations are minimum standards; therefore these regulations do not intend, nor imply that compliance by any person will ensure that there will be no contamination, pollution, nor unauthorized discharge of pollutants. 
E.  Discharge prohibitions. 
(1)  Prohibition of illegal discharges. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses any materials including, but not limited to, pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other than stormwater. 
(2)  The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited, except as described as follows: 
a.  The following discharges are exempt from any discharge prohibitions established by these regulations: 
1)  Water line flushing or other potable water sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising groundwater, groundwater infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped groundwater, foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs, noncommercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wetland flows, swimming pools (if dechlorinated; typically less than one PPM chlorine), firefighting activities, and any other water source not containing pollutants. 
2)  Discharges specified in writing by the authorized enforcement agency as being necessary to protect the public health and safety. 
3)  Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal notification to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the time of the test. Any dye used for testing shall be certified by the contractor to be environmentally safe and he shall provide the city with documentation verifying the environmental effects of the dye. 
4)  The prohibition shall not apply to any non-stormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the federal or state environmental protection agency; provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all permit requirements, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations and; provided that written approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm drain system. 
b.  Prohibition of illicit connections. 
1)  The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited. 
2)  This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. 
3)  A person is considered to be in violation of these regulations if the person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection to continue. 
F.  Suspension of MS4 access. 
(1)  Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The city may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge that presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or United States waters. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or United States waters, or to minimize danger to persons. 
(2)  Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of these regulations may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the authorized enforcement agency for a reconsideration and hearing. 
(3)  Reinstating MS4 access deemed an offense. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to the premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the authorized enforcement agency. 
G.  Industrial or construction activity discharges. Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the city, prior to allowing discharges to the MS4. 
H.  Monitoring. 
(1)  Applicability. This subsection applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction activity. 
(2)  Access to facilities. 
a.  The city shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under these regulations as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with these regulations. If a discharger has security measures in force that require proper identification and clearance before entry onto its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access by city representatives. 
b.  Facility operators shall allow the city ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law. 
c.  The city shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge. 
d.  The city has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
e.  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to the safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the city's written or oral request and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator. 
f.  Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of these regulations. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by these regulations. 
g.  If the city has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of these regulations, or that there is a need to inspect and sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with these regulations or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. 
I.  Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce stormwater pollutants by the use of best management practices. 
(1)  The city will adopt requirements identifying the best management practices (BMPs) for any activity, operation, or facility that may cause or contribute to the pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system, or United States waters. 
(2)  The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at his own expense, reasonable protection from the accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and nonstructural BMPs. 
(3)  Any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. 
(4)  Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with the requirements of the NPDES permit. 
J.  Watercourse protection. Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse. 
K.  Notification of spills. Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system, or United States waters, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services.

ARTICLE 14. - OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING 

14.1 - GENERAL PROVISIONS 
A.  Existing Facilities. 
(1)  The existing number of off-street vehicle, bicycle, and loading spaces may not be reduced below the minimum requirements of this Code. If the number of existing spaces is already less than the requirements of this Article, it may not be further reduced. 
(2)  If a building permit was lawfully issued prior to the effective date of this Code, and if substantial construction has begun within 180 days of the issuance of a permit, the number of off-street vehicle, bicycle, and loading spaces is that required by building permit and supersedes the requirements of this Code. 
B.  Change in Use. When the existing use of a structure or land is changed to a new use, parking and bicycle spaces must be provided as required for the new use, except as described below: 
(1)  No additional vehicle and bicycle parking spaces are required if the change in use would result in an increase of spaces of less than 10%. This also applies to a simultaneous change in use of a group of uses on the same lot which together result in a need for an increase in vehicle and bicycle parking spaces of 10% or less. The 10% increase is calculated by dividing the number of additional spaces required by the number of spaces required before the increase. 
(2)  A change in use is eligible for a parking exemption per Subsection 14.10. 
(3)  A change in use is eligible for shared parking per Subsection 14.11. 
C.  Change in Intensity of Use. Whenever the intensity of a use is increased based on an increase in the number of dwelling units, floor area, seating capacity, or other unit of measurement used to calculate the required number of vehicle and bicycle parking spaces, additional spaces must be provided for that increase, except as described below: 
(1)  Whenever there is an increase in the intensity of a use that creates a need for additional vehicle and bicycle parking spaces of 10% or more, the additional spaces are required. No additional vehicle and bicycle parking spaces are required if the increase in intensity would result in an increase of spaces of less than 10%. This also applies to a simultaneous increase in intensity of a group of uses on the same lot which together result in a need for an increase in vehicle and bicycle parking spaces of 10% or more. The 10% increase is calculated by dividing the number of additional spaces required by the number of spaces required before the increase. 
(2)  An increase in the intensity of a use, which does not qualify for an exemption under item 1 above, is eligible for a parking exemption per Subsection 14.10. 
(3)  An increase in the intensity of a use, which does not qualify for an exemption under item 1 above, is eligible for shared parking per Subsection 14.11. 
D.  Provision of Additional Spaces and Parking Maximums. 
(1)  The establishment of additional off-street parking or loading facilities above 10% of the minimum required by this Code is prohibited in all commercial zoning districts except the D-CM and R-C1 subject to other restrictions, unless otherwise permitted by this code. 
(2)  Where shared parking facilities are established, including parking structures, the maximum number of spaces shall not exceed the sum of the number of spaces required for each individual use that is part of the shared parking calculation. 
E.  Prohibition on Use of Parking Facilities. The sale, repair, or dismantling or servicing of any vehicles, equipment, materials, or supplies, or the display of goods in off-street parking areas is prohibited, unless otherwise permitted by this Code. 
F.  General Requirements. 
(1)  Where multiple uses with different parking requirements occupy the same structure or lot, the required vehicle and bicycle parking and loading spaces is the sum of the requirements for each use computed separately, unless otherwise permitted by this Code. 
(2)  Space allocated to any off-street loading space may not be used to satisfy the requirement for any off-street vehicle or bicycle parking space or access aisle or portion thereof. Conversely, the area allocated to any off-street vehicle or bicycle parking space may not be used to satisfy the replacement for any off-street loading space or portion thereof. 
(3)  A fraction of less than one-half is disregarded, and a fraction of one-half or more is counted as one parking or loading space. 
(4)  For uses where patrons or spectators occupy benches, pews or open floor areas used for service, each 48 linear inches of benches, pews, or permanent seating areas, or five square feet of open floor areas used for seating may be counted as one seat for the purpose of determining the required number of spaces. 
(5)  Except as otherwise provided in this Code, the minimum number of off-street vehicle and bicycle parking spaces to be provided for each use is listed in Table 14.2.1: Off-Street Vehicle and Bicycle Parking Requirements. Construction of all off-street parking must be completed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
(6)  Table 14.2.1 lists parking requirements for each use. In some cases, uses that are considered part of a generic use category are listed with specific vehicle parking requirements. These specific uses are listed only for the purposes of this section and do not indicate whether such uses are permitted or special uses within any district. 
(7)  Certain uses listed within Table 14.2.1 are required to provide bicycle parking spaces when located within all Residential districts, and within the R-C1, D-CM and SSC-RC Zoning districts. Required bicycle spaces should be designed as short-term spaces, which are areas where bicycles will be left for short stops, requiring a high degree of convenience. 
(8)  In situations where the City has previously provided bicycle parking within 250 linear feet, in any direction, provided there is pedestrian access, the use requiring bicycle spaces may provide, in lieu of the required bicycle spaces, other pedestrian friendly or open space amenities with approval from the planning department. 
(9)  Where bicycle parking space requirements indicate "Over 10,000 sf GFA" or other number threshold, this means that bicycle spaces are required only for structures over a certain gross floor area. In these cases, bicycle parking space requirements are calculated on the basis of the entire gross floor area. 
(10)  Motorcycle and scooter parking may be substituted for up to five automobile spaces or 5% of the required parking spaces, whichever is less. For every four motorcycle parking spaces provided, the automobile parking requirement is reduced by one space. 
14.2 - REQUIRED NUMBER OFF-STREET VEHICLE AND BICYCLE PARKING SPACES 
    Any use not identified in Table 14.2.1, shall be required to meet the vehicle parking and bicycle space standards of a use, as determined by the Planning Department, to be similar in nature and which can reasonably be determined to require a comparable number of spaces. Uses which cannot be determined as parallel to any identified use contained in Table 14.2.1 shall be required to meet a standard as determined by the Planning Department through any reasonable and sound method in keeping with the intent of this Article. 
A.  Provision of Car- and Bike-Share Facilities. 
(1)  Spaces within parking lots and structures may include designated parking spaces for car-share facilities. A car-share facility is a membership-based car-sharing service that provides automobile rental to members, billable by the hour or day, and is not considered a vehicle rental establishment. 
(2)  Spaces reserved for car-share facilities may count toward minimum parking requirements of this Code. 
(3)  Spaces within parking lots and structures may include designated areas for bike-share facilities. A bike-share facility provides bicycle rentals to the public and it is not considered a vehicle rental establishment. When a minimum of 20 bicycles are provided for rental, such bike-share facilities equate to 5% of the required vehicle spaces. 
B.  Provision of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations. Spaces within parking lots and structures may include designated parking spaces for electric vehicle charging. Spaces reserved for electric vehicle charging count toward minimum parking requirements of this Code. 
C.  Multi-Tenant Retail/Shopping Center Parking Calculation. Parking for multi-tenant retail centers is calculated as one space required per 500 square feet of gross floor area, rather than by the individual uses. In addition, multi-tenant retail centers over 20,000 square feet in gross floor area require one bicycle space per 2,500 square feet of gross floor area.

(2)  Curb cuts must be included on landscaped areas or islands where such crosswalks are located. ADA compliance is required. 
14.5 - BICYCLE PARKING SPACE DESIGN 
A.  Location. 
(1)  The bicycle parking area must be convenient to building entrances and street access, but may not interfere with normal pedestrian and vehicle traffic. 
a.  Bicyclists and those confined to a wheelchair must not be required to travel over stairs to access parking. 
(2)  Nothing in this Code prevents the provision of additional bicycle spaces in excess of that required in Table 14.2.1. 
(3)  Short-term bicycle parking spaces must be located no more than 50 feet from the principal building entrance and at the same grade as the sidewalk or an accessible route. 
a.  The property owner may make arrangements with the Planning and Development Department and Public Works to place required bicycle parking spaces in the public right-of-way so long as a minimum of five feet of clearance is maintained in the pedestrian way and the bicycle spaces are located within 50 feet of the lot. 
b.  Required bicycle parking spaces may be located in the public right-of-way, with approval from the Planning and Development Department and Public Works, if one or more of the following conditions are met: 
i.  The use does not provide vehicle parking on-site. 
ii.  The addition of bicycle parking on the site would reduce the number of parking spaces below that required by this Code. 
iii.  Bicycle parking spaces in the right-of-way are shared by uses located on the same block-face. In such cases, the number of bicycle spaces required is cumulative of that required by all uses sharing such spaces. 
(4)  Long-term bicycle parking spaces may be located in a covered area that is easily accessible from the public-right-of-way and building entrances. 
(5)  Required bicycle parking for residential uses may be provided in garages, and other resident-accessible, secure areas. Spaces within dwelling units or on balconies do not count toward satisfying bicycle parking requirements.

B.  Shared Parking Calculation. Table 14.11.1 is applied in the following manner: 
(1)  The required number of spaces for each use is calculated according Table 14.2.1. 
(2)  The required number of spaces for each use is then applied to the percentages for each timeframe according to the appropriate land use category in Table 14.11.1 to determine the number of required spaces. This is done for each timeframe category. 
(3)  The numbers are summed within each timeframe and the highest sum total in a timeframe is the required number of spaces. Refer to 14.11(B)(5) below. 
(4)  Shared parking may be located off-site so long as it complies with the location requirements as set forth in this Article. 
(5)  Sample Calculation: Multi-use Office Park.

b.  The shared parking provision allows this Multi-use Office Park to be constructed with 154 spaces (the highest number of spaces within the various timeframes - the 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. timeframe). This is because these timeframe calculations take into account the times of day the various uses utilize the most parking.

a.  Minimum Arterial Right-of-Way width: 100 feet. 
b.  Minimum Collector and Local Roadway widths are 60 feet. 
A.  Right-of-Way Types. The classifications of rights-of-way are divided into the following: 
(1)  Primary Classifications. 
a.  Arterial roadways, also known as Major Streets, carry the majority of trips entering and leaving the Planning Area, as well as the majority of through movements. 
b.  Collector roadways provide both access to and traffic circulation within residential neighborhoods and commercial areas. Collector streets differ from major streets in that collector streets enter residential neighborhoods, distributing trips from arterials through the area to destinations. Collector streets also collect traffic from local streets in residential neighborhoods and channel into the arterial system. 
c.  Local roadways, also known as Minor streets, primarily provide direct access to abutting land and access to the higher order street. 
(2)  Secondary Classifications. 
a.  A Frontage road is a secondary road running parallel to a major street or highway that provides access to houses and businesses. 
b.  Alleys are a vehicular drive located to the rear of lots providing access to service areas, parking, and outbuildings, and often containing utility easements. 
B.  Right-of-Way Dimensional Requirements. Minimum dimensions are provided for each right-of-way type. The illustrative examples are also provided to demonstrate a potential configuration of a right-of-way type. Variations to these configurations may be approved by the City Engineer or City Public Works. All dimensions indicated are minimums for the particular type of right-of-way, unless otherwise indicated. 
C.  Right-of-Way Design Requirements. Figures 15.3.1 through 15.3.8: Right-of-Way Types, provides right-of-way dimensions. Rights-of-way must be designed and constructed in accordance with the standards of this Article.

15.4 - ACCESS MANAGEMENT STANDARDS 
    All proposed developments shall conform to the guidelines in 15.4(A) for vehicular access to the greatest extent possible without denying reasonable access to any proposed development. The following standards shall determine the character and number of access points to be allowed unless the development approval authority determines that unmitigated conditions exist. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit development access to a public right-of-way. 
A.  Development on the State Highway System. Proposed development requesting direct access to an arterial or collector roadway on the state highway system must apply for a driveway permit from the state department of transportation (FDOT) in accordance with F.A.C. Ch. 14-96, State Highway System Connection Permits. FDOT conceptual approval for the driveway must be granted prior to final approval of the development plan by the city. The following minimum distances between driveway connections, median openings and traffic signals shall apply. However, it is not the city's intent to prohibit a duly warranted traffic signal which is required to mitigate safety and access problems. 
Table 15.4.1. Minimum Distances between Driveway Connections, Median Openings, and Traffic Signals 
Posted Speed (MPH) Minimum Connection Spacing (Feet) Minimum Median
Opening (full) (Miles) Minimum Median

d.  Multimodal access shall be provided or constructed for a commercial or multifamily residential development that abuts another commercial or multifamily residential development, whether existing or planed. The development of the site shall incorporate the following: 
i.  Continuous access where necessary to connect adjacent parcels along the thoroughfare. 
ii.  Driveway aprons, stub-outs, and other design features to indicate that abutting properties may be connected to provide cross access. 
iii.  New commercial or multifamily property that abuts a planned, new or existing multifamily residential property shall provide for a minimum five-foot wide sidewalk connecting the two uses. 
C.  Cross-Access. 
(1)  Joint Use Driveways.

vii.  Whenever possible, driveways on undivided arterials, collector streets, or local streets should align with driveways (if any) on the opposite side of such street. 
viii.  On a divided arterial street that includes a median, driveways should align with median breaks whenever possible. Driveways not meeting this standard shall be limited to right turn access (ingress) and right turn egress only. 
(2)  Driveway throat length. The length of a driveway or "throat length" for a commercial or office development shall be designed in accordance with the vehicle storage required for entering and exiting vehicles to prevent vehicles from backing into the flow of traffic on the public street or causing unsafe conflicts with on-site vehicle and pedestrian circulation. The throat lengths specified in the table below are generally acceptable guidelines intended for the major entrance driveway of a commercial development. Alternative designs that meet the safety and circulation needs of vehicular and pedestrian traffic shall be considered by the development approval authority. 
Table 15.4.2. Driveway Throat Length for Commercial Centers

The reasons for the granting of any such variance shall be clearly specified and entered into the city council's minutes. 
17.8 - CONSERVATION DESIGN TRIGGERS 
A.  Certain subdivisions are subject to the requirements for conservation design. This section describes those factors that trigger the required use of conservation design. In addition, when the triggers do not apply, an applicant may choose to subdivide their property in accordance with the conservation design requirements. 
B.  Conservation design is required when the development site meets specific triggers. For the purpose of determining a trigger, the area of analysis must include the property to be subdivided along with a buffer area extending 500 feet around the property. 
C.  An applicant may object to the designation of land as requiring conservation design by demonstrating, through the submittal of an analysis prepared by experts, to the Planning Director, that the property does not meet the triggers for conservation design. If the Planning Director concurs with the evaluations submitted by the applicant, then conservation design is not required. The Planning Director may seek independent expert opinion regarding the analysis and conclusions. 
D.  Conservation design is required when the cumulative acreage contained by the following resources equals or exceeds 20% of the total area of the area of analysis, as defined in item B above:

ARTICLE 18. - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS 

18.1 - INTENT AND PURPOSE 
    The intent of this Article is to encourage the unified development of tracts of land by permitting, within the confines of an overall density limitation, much more creative and flexible concepts in site planning than would otherwise be possible through the strict application of district requirements established in these regulations. Where such flexibility is permitted, planned development project (PDP) design and construction shall follow a carefully devised plan of development which shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements and procedures herein prescribed. 
18.2 - GENERAL REGULATIONS 
    The general regulations for all planned development projects (PDP) shall be as follows: 
A.  Construction of all PDP's shall be initiated within one year after approval of the final plan. 
B.  The owner of a PDP shall provide and permanently maintain the areas required for landscaping and open space purposes. 
C.  The PDP applicant shall be required to provide a detailed statement of assurances, including covenants, agreements or other specific documents, showing ownership and a method of providing perpetual maintenance to be applied to those areas within the project that are to be used for open space, recreational or other common or quasi-public purposes. Such a statement, if required shall be attached to the preliminary and final plats as special conditions. 
D.  Approval of a development order for a PDP shall be conditioned upon the applicant providing an instrument of financial security acceptable to the City Manager, such as an open-end letter of credit or a bond in the amount of 110 percent of the improvements required, including streets, utilities, landscaping, etc. If the PDP is to be developed in separate phases, an instrument of financial security shall be required for each separate phase. 
E.  An applicant for a PDP may include a proposed division of the tract of land within the project property lines into one or more separately owned and operated units. Such proposed divisions, if approved along with the proposed planned development project and if in compliance with the subdivision regulations shall be permissible without further proposed subdivision regulation approval. All projects which include a proposed subdivision of the total tract of land within the property lines into one or more separately owned and operated units shall, if approved, be subject to all attached special conditions and all existing subdivision regulations. 
F.  There shall be no subdivision of an approved planned development project, unless such subdivision is in conformance with the originally approved and recorded final plat or an amended final plat of the planned development project has been approved and recorded. 
G.  There shall be no change, alteration, amendment or extension of any approved planned development project final plan unless such change, alteration, amendment or extension is approved in conformance with the procedures for filing a PDP. 
H.  Construction of all PDP's shall be completed within a designated period after approval of the final plan. The city council may grant an extension of completion time when such extension is deemed reasonable and necessary by the city council. 
I.  In any planned development project (PDP), although it is permissible to depart from conformance with the principal building and single-lot dimension and area regulations contained in these regulations, there shall be no diminution of the regulations and standards set forth for planned development projects. 
(1)  Applications for approval of planned developments projects shall be reviewed by the technical review committee (TRC) and the planning board. The planning board will forward a recommendation to the city council which shall make a determination regarding development order approval. The technical review committee and planning board shall examine the proposed PDP with particular attention to the following criteria: 
a.  The influence the proposed project may be expected to have on existing or future development in surrounding areas and the achievement of a desirable spatial relationship between the buildings and the land, and between the buildings themselves; 
b.  To ensure that the roads, thoroughfares, streets and accompanying access points proposed are suitable and adequate to carry anticipated traffic and the increased land use intensity will not generate traffic in such amounts as to overload the existing or proposed street network; 
c.  To ensure that existing or proposed utility services are adequate for the population densities or land use intensities proposed; and 
d.  To ensure that the proposed project reflects the overall location standards and principles of land use arrangement and design as set forth in the comprehensive plan and especially the land use plan for the area. 
(2)  Off-street parking space shall be provided on the site so that there will be no generation of automobile parking on any street or access road. Driveways shall be constructed and/or streets shall be widened by at least the width of a parking space and/or additional parking areas shall be provided such that there will be a minimum of 21/2 parking spaces for each residential unit. 
(3)  All off-street parking facilities proposed to be located either below ground level or above ground level shall be designed and constructed so that the entrance and exit ramps do not result in direct or indirect traffic congestion on the site or on adjacent streets. 
(4)  Areas shall be provided for the parking, loading and unloading of delivery trucks and other vehicles and for the servicing of buildings by refuse collection, fuel and other service vehicles in addition to the required automobile parking spaces. Such areas shall be adequate in size and so arranged that they may be used without blockage or interference with the use and access ways of automobile parking facilities. 
(5)  A landscaped separation strip at least five feet in width shall be provided and maintained by the developer along all access roads on which off-street parking space is located. 
(6)  Access points on all collector or arterial streets serving a PDP shall be properly located and spaced as provided for in these regulations by Article 15. The development approval authority may approve the use of temporary access points that shall be eliminated by the developer when access roads or other streets are extended to the permanent access points. 
(7)  No planned development project shall be permitted vehicular access to a minor residential street unless specifically approved by the development approval authority (city council). 
(8)  Lighting facilities shall be arranged in such a manner so as to prevent direct glare or hazardous interference of any kind to adjoining streets or properties. The lighting requirements of Article 15 shall be met. 
(9)  All planned development projects shall provide pedestrian and bicycle circulation and access facilities throughout the development to include access to any and all vehicular access points. 
(10)  All planned development project building construction shall conform to all local, state and federal regulations pertaining to the particular type of building proposed. The developer shall provide assurance of such compliance upon submittal of detailed construction plans for review. 
(11)  At minimum, 30% of the developable area within a planned development project shall be dedicated to a combination of open-space, natural space, and/or recreation areas. 
a.  Required landscaping strips shall not be counted toward this calculation. 
i.  Increases in the strip, over the required width, may be counted in the overall open-space calculation. 
(12)  Residential cluster development may be permitted, provided the requirements of Section 18.3 can be met. Additional Fire and Life Safety review shall be required. 
(13)  The technical review committee or planning board may recommend and the city council may require any reasonable special condition necessary to ensure that there shall be no departure from the intent of these regulations. Because a PDP is inherently more complex than a single lot development and because each project must be tailored to the topography and neighboring uses, the standards and special conditions for such projects cannot be inflexible.

The application may be filed on the basis of a conceptual plan as contained in this subsection or the developer may, at his option, omit this step and file his application based on a detailed plan as contained in Subsection 18.5(C) of this Article. 
(1)  Purpose. The purpose of a conceptual plan is to provide an opportunity for a plan to be submitted to the technical review committee and planning board showing the intent of the developer and the nature of development with as little expense as possible. This conceptual plan may serve, at the option of the developer, as the basis for the required public hearing, which, thus, can be held in the early stages of the proposal. 
(2)  Maps and written statement. The conceptual plan shall include the required maps and written statement setting forth the details of the proposed development. The maps must depict the area surrounding the proposed development and demonstrate the relationship of the PDP to the adjoining uses; both existing and those proposed by the developer. The maps shall be in a general schematic form and shall contain the following information: 
a.  The approximate topography; 
b.  Proposed land uses and the approximate location of existing and proposed buildings and other structures on the site and existing buildings, structures and uses adjacent to the site; 
c.  The proposed character and approximate density of dwellings; 
d.  The approximate location of all streets and rights-of-way, walkways, and parking facilities; 
e.  Public uses, including schools, parks, playgrounds and other open spaces; and 
f.  The maps shall indicate which facilities are to be public or private. 
(3)  Explanation. The written statement shall contain an explanation of the: 
a.  Character of the proposed development and the manner in which it has been designed to take advantage of the PDP concept; 
b.  Proposed sewage disposal facilities, water supply and stormwater drainage provisions; 
c.  Manner of financing proposed; 
d.  Present ownership of all the land included within the planned development project; 
e.  Method proposed to maintain private common open areas, buildings and other facilities; and 
f.  General indication of the expected schedule of development. 
(4)  Public hearing. A public hearing is required for approval of all PDP's and may be held based on the conceptual plan or on the detailed plan at the option of the developer. All property owners within 500 feet of the boundaries of the proposed PDP will receive notification of the public hearing. Costs of such notification shall be paid by the developer prior to advertisement of the hearing. 
(5)  Conceptual plan approval. 
a.  If, after a public hearing, the planned development project is approved by the city council, then a resolution shall be passed by the city council stating that they will designate the specified area as a PDP; provided that the city council approves the detailed plan, or final plan, as is appropriate. 
b.  In the event the city council has conditioned its approval upon required modifications to the plan, then such conceptual plan approval shall not be effective until the developer has filed, with the Planning and Development Department written agreement to modify the plan as required. 
c.  If a detailed plan covering the area in the conceptual plan has not been filed within six months from the date of approval of the conceptual plan, the approval shall expire. The city council at its discretion, may extend for additional periods not in excess of six months each, the filing of the detailed plan when, good cause for such extension is shown. 
C.  Detailed plan. 
(1)  Purpose. The purpose of the detailed plan is to provide a specific and particular plan upon which the city council will base its decision. Substantial compliance with the detailed plan is necessary for the preparation of the final plan. When seeking approval of a planned development project, the detailed plan should be filed as follows: 
a.  As the initial plan if no conceptual plan has been approved at the time application is made, or 
b.  As the second step plan when a conceptual plan has been approved. The detailed plan may be submitted in stages or in its entirety, within six months following its approval, unless an extension has been granted. 
(2)  Maps and written statement. If a conceptual plan has not been filed and approved, then the detailed plan must include the following information in addition to that required for the conceptual plan and written statement: 
a.  A map showing: 
i.  Street location and nature of the improvements; 
ii.  Lot lines and lot design; 
iii.  The landscaping and tree planting plan; and 
iv.  Stormwater drainage system; 
b.  Areas proposed to be conveyed, dedicated or reserved for parks, parkways, playgrounds, school sites, public buildings and similar uses; 
c.  A site plan for each building, except single-family lots, and the common areas, showing the approximate location of all buildings, structures, and improvements, and indicating the open spaces around the buildings and structures; 
d.  Elevation and perspective drawings of all typical proposed structures and improvements, except single-family residences and their accessory buildings. The drawings need not be the result of final architectural designs and need not be in construction detail; 
e.  A development schedule indicating: 
i.  The approximate date when the construction of the project can be expected to begin; 
ii.  The phases in which the project will be built and the approximate date when construction of each phase can be expected to begin; 
iii.  The approximate dates when the development of each of the phases in the development will be completed; and 
iv.  The area and location of common open space that will be provided for each phase; 
f.  Agreements, provisions, declarations or covenants which govern the use, maintenance and continued protection of the planned development project and any of its common open areas; and 
g.  The following plans and diagrams will be provided when the technical review committee or planning board finds that the PDP creates special problems for traffic or parking: 
i.  An off-street parking and loading plan; and 
ii.  A circulation plan indicating the proposed movement of vehicles, goods and pedestrians, within the PDP and to and from existing thoroughfares. Any special engineering features and traffic regulation devices needed to facilitate or ensure the safety of this circulation pattern must be shown. 
(3)  Detailed plan approval. 
a.  If a conceptual development plan was not submitted and approved, the detailed plan shall be considered in the same manner as provided for in the conceptual plan. 
b.  If a conceptual plan was submitted, the public hearing was held and the conceptual plan was approved, then the technical review committee and the planning board shall compare the detailed plan with the conceptual plan and with the standards set forth in these regulations. If the detailed plan conforms substantially to the conceptual plan and to the standards set forth in these regulations, the city council shall grant approval of the detailed plan. The city council may place conditions upon its approval to ensure conformance to the plan as approved. 
c.  Duration of approval. City council approval of the detailed plan shall be valid for a six-month period following the date of such approval. At its discretion, the city council may extend the detailed plan approval for additional six-month periods. 
(4)  Disapproval of detailed plan. In the event the city council is unable to find the detailed plan in substantial conformance to the purpose and intent of the conceptual plan, the city council shall not grant approval of the plan as submitted. 
(5)  Site improvements. The developer, at his option, may construct street improvements, sidewalks, utilities and other permanent site improvements after the detailed plan approval. The location of the buildings may be staked and applications for building permits may be submitted. Under no circumstances, however, will any building permit be issued until final plan approval has been granted and the necessary portions of the final plan recorded. The construction of improvements must be in accordance with the detailed plan and the provisions of these regulations, to obtain final plan approval. 
D.  Final plan. 
(1)  Public record. The final plan is the permanent public record of the PDP and will be the manner in which the development is constructed as provided herein. 
(2)  Contents. The final plan shall be filed within six months of the date of approval of the detailed plan and shall contain, in final form, the information required for the detailed plan. In addition, the following will apply: 
a.  If parcels of land are to be sold, then a subdivision plat in the form prescribed by the city council shall be filed for approval in the appropriate manner; 
b.  If land within the planned development project is not to be sold in individual parcels, then a site plan shall be prepared and filed with the city council which is suitable for inclusion in the county deed records. A permanent reproducible transparency of the final plan shall be filed with the Planning and Development Department; and 
c.  Condominium plats do not need to be filed with, or approved by the city council. They are to be recorded as a distinct and separate act from the documents noted in subsections III-6.6(d)(2)a and III-6.6(d)(2)b of this section. 
(3)  Final plan approval. The city council shall review the final plan and shall approve the final plan if it is in substantial conformance with the approved detailed plan. 
a.  The city council shall require, as a condition of approval, the submission of satisfactory evidence that the improvements will be constructed, such as an instrument of financial security referenced in section 4.2(J). 
b.  The city council shall not approve the final plan or any phase of the planned development project if the average of the allowable dwelling units per acre, up to and including the phase which is to be approved, exceeds by more than ten percent the average number of dwelling units per acre which is allowable for the entire PDP. 
c.  Upon final approval and after all conditions have been met, the city council shall approve the recording of the final plan in the deed records when no parcels are to be sold. In the instance where parcels are to be sold, the developer will process and have recorded the subdivision plat in the manner designated by the county. 
E.  Substantial conformance. The determination of substantial conformance between the detailed plan and the final plan shall be at the city council's discretion. Any variation in conformance is intended solely to facilitate the minor adjustments which may be necessary as the plans approach a final construction stage. The city council may refuse to grant approval of substantial conformance if, in their opinion, the adjustments are being used to significantly modify the approved plan. 
18.5 - DESIGNATION ON THE OFFICIAL ZONING MAP 
    Any land for which an application for a planned development project has been approved shall be designated on the official zoning map by the letter "PDP" - "Number." The "Number" shall be progressive as the projects are approved. The PDP designation shall not constitute a change in the district boundary, but shall serve as an overlay district. As such, approval of a PDP shall not require an amendment to the city's Future Land Use or Zoning Map, if the PDP is allowed within the district in which it is approved. 
APPENDIX A. - CITY BOUNDARY MAP 

APPENDIX B. - THE CITY OF MILTON BIO-RETENTION AND CONVEYANCE SYSTEMS DESIGN GUIDELINES 
    The following design guidelines are intended to present developers within the City of Milton, information regarding the existence and potential of various alternative on-site stormwater management techniques. These guidelines are based on information found in the Florida Field Guide to Low Impact Development created by the University of Florida IFAS Extension. This guide provides a broad stroke of information on two commonly used methods of on-site stormwater treatment systems. Definitions, objectives, and considerations for these methods are outlined in the following passages. Installation and maintenance of these items shall be based on manufacturer and engineering specifications. 
A.  Bio-retention Areas. 
Description. Bio-retention basins, or areas, often referred to as Rain Gardens, are typically shallow planted depressions which are designed to retain or detain stormwater on-site before it is either infiltrated or discharged downstream. Rain Gardens typically refer to bio-retention basins which are smaller in scope and scale, often times utilized on individual residential lots and small non-residential developments. Bio-retention basins, on the other hand, are larger areas designed to handle more intense developments such as multi-family and larger non-residential sites as common areas. 
Objective. Bio-retention basins, regardless of size, retain, filter, and treat stormwater runoff using the basin dimensions, soil types, and conditioning. Depending upon design, bio-retention basins can provide retention or detention of runoff to trap and remove suspended solids and also filter or absorb pollutants as part of infiltration or prior to discharge into the City's Stormwater System. 
Applications. Generally speaking, bio-retention basins should be limited to the following types of developments. Size and design shall be dependent upon development size and type as well as the desired outcome of the basin. 
Residential Yards, including Multi-family development; 
Commercial Development; 
Parking Lot Islands; and 
Roadways. 
Benefits. 
1)  Water Protection - Bio-retention basins can remove pollutants through infiltration and plant uptake and absorption. 
2)  Run-Off Reduction - Bio-retention basins are designed to capture and retain stormwater on-site reducing the need for larger holding ponds and stormwater transmission off-site. 
3)  Improved Aesthetics - Bio-retention basins and rain gardens improve the aesthetic value of development and help to reduce irrigation costs. 
Site and Design Considerations. 
1)  Inflow and outflow characteristics of the site must be considered. As well as the basins place in the overall landscape design and treatment system. 
2)  Generally these areas are utilized to encourage and increase infiltration. Location of the system in relation to other site components and soils should always be considered. For instance, bio-retention basins should not be placed where ponding historically occurred on site. Nor should a basin be placed over a septic tank. 
3)  Infiltration systems must be designed with soil types and water table depths in mind. Underdrains may need to be incorporated where soil conductivity is low. 
4)  Basin slope should be a maximum of 3:1. Ponding depths should not exceed 12 inches and ponding duration should not exceed 24 hours after a storm event. 
5)  Safety concerns and mosquito mitigation should also be considered when designing a bio-retention system. 

B.  Bioswales. 
Description. A Bioswale is a vegetated swale or depression used to partially treat water quality, to retain and move stormwater run-off, and to attenuate flooding potential. Bioswales are similar to bio-retention basins in structure but are typically more linear in design. 
Objective. Bioswales are designed to function as open-channels or drainage ways, which either convey or hold stormwater run-off. They can be used in conjunction with and as an enhancement of traditional stormwater systems or as a standalone alternative. Bioswales can be designed for transmission, or for storage and infiltration. 
Applications. 
1)  Bioswales can be used on a larger scale than Bio-retention basins and rain gardens. They are typically utilized in parking lot islands and medians, as roadside and even highway median systems. One of the most appropriate applications are within landscape buffer yards. 
2)  There are typically two types of swales utilized by development: wet swales and dry swales. 
3)  Wet swales use storage time and vegetation to reduce flow and trap pollutants and increase water quality. Dry swales are designed to facilitate infiltration of stormwater there by treating both the quantity and quality of stormwater run-off as well. Both designs are typically aspects of larger stormwater treatment systems and work best in conjunction with bio-retention basins and other infiltration areas. 
Benefits. The benefits of bioswales are similar to bio-retention basins. They mitigate against flooding through infiltration or transmission of stormwater run-off, improve water quality through vegetative absorption and infiltration, and can be integrated into landscape designs as aesthetically pleasing components. Often times, if designed properly, with xeriscaping or other techniques, landscaping irrigation costs can be substantially lower than normal systems which require scheduled watering. 
Site and Design Considerations. Again, there are a lot of similarities in the siting and design considerations between bioswales and bio-retention basins. Soil types, water table depth, and service area size all need to be considered as well as the amount of impervious surface area and the slope of the area being served. 
1)  Bioswales should be used in areas that are not overly flat or in areas which are too steep. 
2)  As a rule of thumb when designing a bioswale or system of bioswales, areas larger than ten acres with slopes greater than 5%, should not be served by a bioswale(s) alone but could certainly be utilized as a component of a larger stormwater system. 
3)  Soil composition is an important consideration when determining placement and design of bioswale systems. As well as a bioswales' place in the larger landscaped area and stormwater system. 
4)  Plant material selection is key to water quality treatment and to the effective life of a swale. Plants that are less water tolerant or non-native species may not survive or may not treat the water as well as others.
