PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Village of Libertyville, Illinois. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1977 Code, as supplemented through May 15, 1981, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the board of trustees. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1977 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Numbering System 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-2 and the first section of Chapter 4 is 4-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of the editorial staff, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Village Administrator Kevin J. Bowens, former Village Administrator Allen H. Schertz, former Assistant Village Administrator Gerald R. Peterson, Village Attorney Clifford L. Weaver and former Village Attorney Stewart Diamond, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code which will make the active law of the village readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the village's affairs.

Adopting Ordinance 
Ordinance No. 93-0-61 
An Ordinance Adopting and Enacting a Municipal Code for the Village of Libertyville, Illinois; Providing for the Repeal of Certain Ordinances Not Included Therein; Providing a Penalty for the Violation Thereof; Providing for the Manner of Amending Such Code; and Providing When Such Code and This Ordinance Shall Become Effective. 
Be It Ordained by the President and Board of Trustees of the Village of Libertyville, County of Lake, State of Illinois, as Follows: 
    Section One: Adoption of Code. The document entitled the "Libertyville, Illinois Municipal Code" (the "Code"), published by Municipal Code Corporation and consisting of Chapters 1 through 26, each inclusive, shall be and it hereby is adopted. From and after the effective date of this ordinance, the Code shall be accepted in all courts without question as the official Municipal Code and law of the Village of Libertyville, Illinois as enacted by the President and Board of Trustees of the Village of Libertyville. 
    Section Two: Repeal. All ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted on or before April 27, 1993, and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein, shall be and they hereby are repealed; provided, however, that all ordinances of a general and permanent nature included in the Code shall be considered as a continuation of said ordinance provision and the fact that some provisions have been deliberately eliminated by the President and Board of Trustees of the Village of Libertyville shall not serve to cause any interruption in the continuous effectiveness of ordinances included in the Code. 
    Section Three: No Revival. The repeal provided for in Section Two above shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance that is repealed by this ordinance. 
    Section Four: Interim Amendments. Ordinances adopted after April 27, 1993 and prior to the effective date of this ordinance that amend or refer to ordinances that have been codified in the Code, shall be construed as if they amend or refer to like provisions of the Code. 
    Section Five: Future Amendments. Additions or amendments to the Code when passed in the form as to indicate the intention of the President and Board of Trustees of the Village of Libertyville to make the same a part of the Code shall be deemed to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code includes the additions and amendments. 
    Section Six: Penalties. Unless another penalty is expressly provided, every person convicted of a violation of any provision of the Code or any ordinance, rule or regulation adopted or issued in pursuance thereof, shall be punished by a fine of not less than $15.00 and not more than $500.00. Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. The penalty provided by this Section, unless another penalty is expressly provided shall apply to the amendment of any Code section whether or not such penalty is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the Village may pursue other remedies such as, but no[t] limited to, abatement of ordinances, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits. 
    Section Seven: Supplements. There is hereby adopted, as a method of perpetual codification, the loose-leaf type of binding together with the continuous supplement service provided by Municipal Code Corporation, whereby each newly adopted ordinance of a general and permanent nature amending, altering, adding or deleting provisions of the Code is properly edited, with the appropriate page or pages reprinted and inserted in the proper place in each of the official copies of the Code. Three copies of the Code shall be maintained in the office of the Village Clerk, certified as to correctness and available for inspection at any and all times during regular business hours. It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to change or amend by additions or deletions, any part or portion of the Code, or to insert or delete pages or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with the Code in any manner whatsoever that will cause the law of the Village or Libertyville to be misrepresented thereby. 
    Section Eight: Effective Date. This ordinance shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage, approval and publication in pamphlet form as provided by law. 
    Passed this 14th day of December, 1993.

A new appearance date will be set, and arrangements will be made to have a duly authorized official of the village present on that new date. Failure to notify the clerk of your intention to plead not guilty or your intention to demand a jury trial may result in your having to return to court if you plead not guilty or demand a jury trial on your original appearance date. Please be advised that a jury fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for a six-person jury and fifty dollars ($50.00) for a twelve-person jury will be required in all cases where the offense is punishable by fine only. 
Upon timely receipt of notice that the defendant intends to plead not guilty, the clerk of the court will set a new appearance date not less than seven (7) days nor more than forty-nine (49) days after the original appearance date set by the village administrator, and notify all parties of the new date and the time for appearance.

Personal service of a summons or citation may be made by personally delivering the summons or citation to the defendant, or by leaving a copy at the defendant's usual place of abode with some person of the defendant's family of the age of thirteen (13) years or older, and informing that person of the contents thereof; provided that, when making such service on anyone other than the defendant, a copy of the summons or citation shall be sent to the defendant at his usual place of abode in a sealed envelope with postage fully prepaid. 
(3)  Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed or interpreted as precluding or preventing service of summons or citations as permitted by all applicable provisions of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure, the Illinois Supreme Court Rules, the Illinois Municipal Code, the local rules of the circuit court, or as otherwise permitted by law. 
(d)  Transmission to circuit court clerk. Within forty-eight (48) hours after issuing a citation, the village administrator shall transmit the portions of the citation entitled "Complaint" and "Disposition Report" either in person or by mail to the clerk of the circuit court for further disposition in accordance with applicable law. 
(e)  Written plea of guilty.

If a defendant fails to appear on the date set for appearance or any date to which the case may be continued, the village shall request the court to enter an ex parte judgment against the defendant assessing fines, penalties and costs in an amount not to exceed fifty dollars ($50.00). The village may also file a verified citation against the defendant and ask the court to issue a warrant for the defendant's arrest. 
(h)  Payment of fines. Upon conviction for a violation of any village code or regulation, and imposition of a fine, the defendant shall tender payment of his fine in accordance with applicable law. Upon receipt of any proceeds from any fine, the village administrator shall deposit such proceeds in the village treasury. 
Sec. 1-14. - Offenses punishable under several sections. 
    In all cases where a violation is made punishable under more than one section or provision of any village code or regulation, the village administrator may proceed under one or more of the applicable sections or provisions, but in no case shall more than one penalty be imposed upon a person for a single violation except that the revocation of a license or permit or the issuance of any stop order or similar cease and desist order shall not be considered a penalty so as to bar any other penalty from being imposed and except that separate penalties may be imposed for each day during which a violation occurs or continues. 
Sec. 1-15. - Private remedies preserved.

An officer or any other agent who has a position of comparable authority for the formulation of corporate policy or the supervision of subordinate employees in a managerial capacity is legally accountable for any offense committed in the name of or in behalf of the corporation to the same extent as if it were performed in his own name and behalf and may be prosecuted for violations of this Code.

The order to correct a code violation and the sanctions imposed by the Village of Libertyville as the result of a finding of a code violation under this chapter shall attach to the property as well as to the owner of the property, so that a finding of a code violation against one (1) owner cannot be avoided by conveying or transferring the property to another owner. Any subsequent transferee or owner of property takes subject to the findings, decision and order of a hearing officer under this chapter. 
(n)  Sanctions; excessive rental units. 
(1)  The owner of a building located in the Village of Libertyville who, directly or indirectly, has collected, or caused to be collected, rentals from an occupant of that building during a period in which the number of apartments or family units in that building exceeded the number permitted for that building by an ordinance of the village, is liable to any such occupant in an amount equal to not more than three (3) times the amount of any rentals paid by any such occupant, or in his behalf, after January 1, 1970, together with court costs and reasonable attorney's fees. If the occupant is a recipient of public aid under Article III, IV, or VI of "the Illinois Public Aid Code," approved April 11, 1967, as amended, in whose behalf vendor payment of the rental was made by the Illinois Department of Public Aid, the Department of Human Services (acting as successor to the Department of Public Aid under the Department of Human Services Act), or a local governmental unit, as the case may be, the liability as herein provided is to the Illinois Department of Public Aid, the Department of Human Services (acting as successor to the Department of Public Aid under the Department of Human Services Act), or the local governmental unit making the vendor payment of the rental. 
(2)  For the purposes of this section: 
a.  Owner means the legal or beneficial owner of a building. 
b.  Family unit means a room or group of rooms used or intended to be used as a housekeeping unit for living, sleeping, cooking and eating. The fact that any such family unit is used or intended to be used with cooking or eating accommodations in common with another family unit in any such building does not affect liability hereunder. 
(3)  No liability accrues under this section until thirty (30) days after the owner of record of a building has been notified in writing that such owner is in violation of any such municipal ordinance. Such notice shall be personally served upon such owner of record or sent by registered mail to the last known address of such owner. 
(o)  A person who contracts with the federal government or any of its agencies, including without limitation the department of housing and urban development, to care for vacant residential real estate shall be responsible for maintaining the property to prevent and correct municipal health and safety code violations. A person who intentionally violates this section is guilty of a business offense and shall be fined not less than five hundred one dollars ($501.00) and not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).

    Alarm agent means any person employed by an alarm business whose duties include the altering, installing, maintaining, moving, repairing, replacing, selling, servicing, responding to, or causing others to respond to an alarm device. New construction personnel who are not in the employ of an alarm business but who may be involved under contracts or subcontracts in the installation of wiring, breakers, or other items which will ultimately be utilized by a licensed alarm business or agent in the installation of an alarm system are not required to obtain licenses as alarm businesses or alarm agents. 
    Alarm business means any business operated by a person for a profit which engages in the activity of altering, installing, leasing, maintaining, repairing, replacing, selling, servicing or responding to a security or fire alarm system, or which causes any of these activities to take place.

If, however, an alarm system on a motor vehicle is connected with an alarm system at a premises, other than a proprietary system, the person using such a system is an alarm user. Also excluded from this definition and from the coverage of this chapter are persons who use alarm systems to alert or signal persons, within the premises in which the alarm system is located, of an attempted unauthorized intrusion or holdup. If such a system, however, employs an audible signal emitting sounds or flashing lights, or a beacon designed to signal persons outside the premises, such system shall be within the definition of alarm system and shall be subject to this chapter. 
    Annunciator means the instrumentation on an alarm console at the receiving terminal of a signal line which through both visual and audible signals shows when an alarm device at a particular location has been activated, or indicates line trouble. 
    Answering service means a private telephone service providing, among its services, the service of receiving, on a continuous basis through trained employees, emergency signals from alarm systems, and thereafter immediately relaying the message by live voice to the communication centers of the police department and/or fire department. 
    Automatic dialing device means an alarm system which automatically sends over regular telephone lines, by direct connection or otherwise, a prerecorded voice message or coded signal indicating the existence of the emergency situation that the alarm system is designed to detect. 
    Central station means the physical location of the alarm equipment to which remote alarm and supervisory signaling devices are connected, where operators supervise the circuits, and where guards are maintained continuously to investigate signals, and also as defined in the edition of National Fire Protection Association Standards, Number 72, and subsequent amendments thereto. "Central station" shall not mean or refer to the communication center of the police or fire department or any of their equipment. 
    Central station equipment means the signal receiving, recording or retransmitting equipment installed in the central station, and also as defined in the edition of National Fire Protection Association Standards, Number 72, and subsequent amendments thereto. 
    Central station system means a system in which the operations of electrical protection circuits and devices are signaled automatically to, recorded in, maintained, and supervised from a central station having trained operators and guards in attendance at all times, and also as defined in the edition of National Fire Protection Association Standards, Number 72, and subsequent amendments thereto. 
    Direct connect means an alarm system which has the capability of transmitting system signals to and receiving them at an agency maintained by the local government. 
    Direct line means a telephone line leading directly from a central station to the communications center of the police department and/or fire department that is for use only to report emergency signals on a person-to-person basis. 
    False alarm means the activation of an alarm system through mechanical failure, malfunction, improper installation, or as a result of the negligence, misuse or misconduct of the owner or lessee of an alarm system or of his employees or agents.

    Police chief means the chief of the police department of the village or his designated representative. 
    Primary trunkline means a telephone line leading directly into the communication centers of the police department and/or fire department that is for the purpose of handling emergency calls on a person-to-person basis, and which is identified as such by a specific number included among the emergency numbers listed by the telephone company and covering the service area within the jurisdiction of the police and fire departments. 
    Proprietary system means an alarm system sound and/or recording alarm and supervisory signals at a control center located within the protected premises, the control center being under the supervision of the proprietor of the protected premises and/or as defined by the 1987 edition of National Fire Protection Association Standards, Number 72D. If a proprietary system includes a signal line connected directly or by means of an automatic dialing device to a police communication center and/or fire communication center, a central station, modified central station or an answering service, it thereby becomes an alarm system as defined in this chapter. 
    Special trunkline means a telephone line leading into the communication center of the police department and/or fire department and having the primary purpose of handling emergency signals or messages originating either directly or through a central location from automatic dialing devices covering the service area within the jurisdiction of the police and fire departments.

In addition, there shall be a minimum annual maintenance fee as established by the annual fee ordinance. Each connection shall be allowed a maximum of three (3) false alarms for which there shall be no additional charge over and above the minimum fee. False alarms in excess of three (3) are governed by the fee structure in section 3-12. 
(b)  Alarm users utilizing central station or answering service alarm systems will be required to have an alarm users' permit, for which the fee shall be as established by the annual fee ordinance. In addition, such users shall pay a minimum annual maintenance fee as established by the annual fee ordinance. Each connection shall be allowed a maximum of three (3) false alarms for which there shall be no additional charge over and above the basic charge. False alarms in excess of three (3) are governed by the fee structure in section 3-12. 
(c)  Annual service charges shall be paid in advance, at the beginning of each year, within thirty (30) days of billing. The fees for new permittees shall be prorated based upon the time of year each permittee receives a permit. This annual fee is intended only to cover the cost of providing personnel to monitor incoming calls and dispatching necessary personnel and equipment, but does not cover the cost of providing police and fire personnel or equipment in responding to such alarms. 
(d)  All users of the types of systems described in subsections (a) and (b) of this section will be regulated by provisions governing false alarms and fees related thereto. 
(Ord. No. 89-0-63, § 1(21.10.5), 12-12-89) 
Sec. 3-12. - False alarms; fees. 
(a)  It is the intent of the village to reduce the number of false alarms generated by alarm systems even though fees are imposed upon subscribers for the occurrence of false alarms. Nevertheless, a thirty-day grace period for new fire alarm systems or for major modifications and/or additions to existing fire alarm systems, and a three-day grace period for a malfunctioning fire alarm system, shall be granted upon request of the alarm user to the fire chief; and a seven-day grace period for new burglar alarm systems shall be granted upon request of the alarm user to the police chief. During such grace periods such alarms shall be responded to in an emergency manner and such alarms shall not be counted when calculating the false alarm fees due in any given calendar year. 
(b)  More than two (2) false alarms in any calendar year from any alarm system for which an alarm permit has been obtained may constitute grounds for revocation of such permit unless the alarm user pays a fee to the village, after each such occurrence, according the schedule set out in the annual fee ordinance. 
(c)  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the police chief and/or fire chief may determine an alarm system to be a public nuisance or adverse to the safety of the public. Except as provided, in subsection (d) of this section, upon such determination, the police chief and/or fire chief shall notify the alarm user in writing by certified mail of such fact and require that the permit holder submit a report to the police chief and/or fire chief within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice, describing efforts to discover and eliminate the cause of the false alarms. If, however, the alarm user, by reason of absence from the village or on any other reasonable basis, requests an extension of time to file the report, the police chief and/or fire chief shall extend the fifteen-day period for a reasonable period. If the permit holder fails to submit the required report within fifteen (15) days or within any such extended period, the police and/or fire chief may revoke the user's permit and under such circumstances the user shall not be entitled to a hearing or appeal under this chapter. 
(d)  When false alarms repeatedly sound at a single location during a one- to two-day period creating an undue burden upon the resources of the fire and/or police departments, the departments shall be authorized to summarily disconnect the alarm system from the communication center provided that the following conditions are met: 
(1)  The owner, agent or occupant is unavailable and, upon diligent inquiry, cannot be located; and 
(2)  The chief or other person in charge of the fire and/or police department has determined, following repeated visits to the site, as a result of the false alarm, that no emergency exists and that the source of the alarm is a malfunction. 
(e)  If the alarm user fails to submit a report as provided in subsection (c) of this section or if the alarm user submits a report as required by subsection (c) of this section but the police chief and/or fire chief determines that the report is unsatisfactory or that the alarm user has failed to show by the report that he has taken or will take reasonable steps to eliminate or reduce false alarms, then the police chief and/or fire chief may issue written notice by certified mail of his intent to revoke or suspend the alarm user's permit. 
(f)  Any institutional user charged for more than fifteen (15) false alarms within a period of one (1) year shall be required to provide instruction to its employees on the proper use of the alarm system unless the user can demonstrate to the fire and/or police chief that the false alarms are the result of a malfunction of the system and that reasonable steps have been taken to correct the malfunction or replace the system. Any individual user charged for more than eight (8) false alarms during a period of one (1) year shall be required to obtain instruction from the alarm system business which installed, monitors or maintains the alarm system on the proper use of the system unless the user can demonstrate to the fire and/or police chief that the false alarms are the result of a malfunction of the system and that reasonable steps have been taken to correct the malfunction or replace the system. 
(g)  The fire chief and the police chief shall have the sole authority to determine whether an alarm shall be classified as a false alarm. 
(h)  No permit for a legally required fire alarm system may be revoked without approval of the fire chief. If the permit for a legally required fire alarm system is revoked, all uses and/or occupancies shall be discontinued immediately and the permittee, owner or responsible party having control of the premises shall cease or cause the cessation of its operations. Failure of the party to comply with this subsection shall authorize the appropriate official to seek injunctive relief or other remedies pursuant to section 3-6. 
(i)  When a false fire alarm is responded to by the fire department and the owner or agent is on the premises, such person shall not reset the alarm, but shall allow it to continue sounding so that the fire department personnel will have the opportunity to determine the source or cause of the malfunction. 
(Ord. No. 89-0-63, § 1(21.10.13), 12-12-89; Ord. No. 04-O-25, § 2, 4-27-04) 
Sec. 3-13. - Direct communications to the fire department. 
(a)  Upon favorable recommendations of the fire chief, alarms from business premises, financial institutions, and residences may be terminated in the fire department dispatch center. 
(b)  The alarm subscriber approved for a direct connection to the fire department dispatch center or the alarm businesses contracting for the servicing of the subscriber's alarm system shall be responsible for obtaining a leased AES radio in order to transmit the proper signals from the subscriber's premises and the alarm receiving equipment. 
(c)  No alarm subscriber shall utilize an AES radio other than those approved by the fire chief or his designee in order to prevent improper signals/interference from being transmitted over the village's dedicated system to the receiving equipment. 
(d)  The Village of Libertyville Police Department does not accept any type of direct-connect burglar, holdup, or panic alarms to the police department or dispatch center.

(1)  The contents of the recorded message to be transmitted by such devices must be intelligible and in a format approved by the police chief and/or fire chief as appropriate for the type of emergency being reported. 
(2)  Upon a single stimulus of the alarm device, an automatic dialing device may place two (2) separate calls to the communication center via the special trunkline. No such call shall be longer than one (1) minute and fifteen (15) seconds in duration. There must be at least three (3) minutes between the completion of the first call and the initiation of the second, and the second call must be clearly identified as a second call. 
(3)  All such devices shall be capable of transmitting an emergency message to two (2) or more separate locations, so that upon activation any message may be sent not only on a special trunkline or a telephone line serviced directly by the telephone company operators but also to a location where an authorized person is available to respond to the emergency message, and to open the premises on which the device is installed. 
(4)  The sensory apparatus and hardware comprising such devices shall be maintained by the owner or lessee in such physical condition that false alarms will be minimized. 
(5)  This section shall apply only to those automatic dialing devices interconnected to the communication center of the police department, any other municipal office or to a telephone company operator. 
(6)  Automatic dialers shall not be used for alarm systems required by building or fire codes of the village. 
(7)  All users of this type of system will be regulated by provisions of this chapter governing false alarms. 
(8)  The owner or lessee of an automatic dialing device which is interconnected to a special trunkline transmitting directly into the police and/or fire department shall pay the village a minimum annual user's fee as established by the annual fee ordinance.

(b)  If such inspection reveals any violations of the provisions of this chapter, a written report detailing such violations shall be promptly sent to the village administrator and to the owner, lessee or other person responsible for the alarm system in violation of this chapter. Such report shall require the correction within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice of the violation discovered, and shall state that a failure to comply may result in the revocation of the alarm user's permit, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter relating to revocation of licenses and permits. The alarm user shall be granted a reasonable extension of time to correct such violations upon good cause shown. 
(Ord. No. 89-0-63, § 1(21.10.8), 12-12-89)

The application shall contain a general description of the proposed work, its location, the use and occupancy of all parts of the building or structure and of all portions of the site or lot not covered by the building or structure, and such additional information as may be required by the building official. 
(e)  Plans and specifications. The application for the permit shall be accompanied by not less than four (4) copies of specifications and of plans drawn to scale, with sufficient clarity, detail and dimensions to clearly show the nature and character of the work to be performed. When quality of materials or systems is essential for conformity to this code, specific information shall be given to establish such quality; and this code shall not be cited, or the term "legal" or "its equivalent" be used, as a substitute for specific information. All plans and specifications shall conform to section 6-35, concerning professional architectural and engineering services. The building official may waive the requirement for filing plans when the work involved is of a minor nature. Where application is made for an unusually complex or innovative design or magnitude of construction or where standards referenced in the model codes, as adopted in this article, must be extensively applied to determine code compliance, the building official may require that the plan review be conducted by the ICC plan review service or other approved plan review services. With the developer/owner's concurrence, the building official shall forward the plans and specifications to the plan review service, receive and analyze the plan review reports and proceed with normal permit processing. The cost of the plan review, and of department handling and paperwork, shall be paid to the village by the applicant as prescribed in the annual fee schedule. 
(f)  Certificate of survey. There shall be a certificate of survey prepared, signed and sealed by a qualified land surveyor licensed by the state, showing all boundaries of the property, setback lines, existing structures, if any, and all easements of record submitted with the application. 
(g)  Site plan. 
(1)  There shall also be submitted a fully dimensioned site plan, drawn to scale in accordance with a plat of survey, showing the size and location of all new construction and all existing buildings, structures, and trees over six-inch caliper (see provisions of chapter 9 pertaining to soil erosion control and tree preservation), if applicable, on the site, distances of the building or structure to all property lines, the existing grades at the corners of the site and at as many other locations as necessary to show the topography of the site. The site plan shall also show the proposed final grades of the top of the building foundation walls and the finished site grades at all corners and at sufficient other points on and off the site to clearly show the intended surface water drainage plan. All parking lots with the required vehicle parking stalls, all outside lighting, landscaping, utility lines and other required elements shall also be shown on the same site plan for ease of understanding and suitable for submission to the plan commission, appearance review commission and the village board. 
(2)  One- and two-family site plans shall show the applicable information with the top of the foundation grade and finished yard grades assigned by the village engineering office where the building is being built in a previously approved subdivision. Scattered building sites shall show the applicable information as required based on the existing buildings and grades as established. 
(3)  For demolition projects, the site plan shall show all buildings and structures to be demolished and the location and size of all existing buildings and structures that are to remain on the site, and shall show all finished grades, stormwater drainage structures and swales to drain the site upon completion of the demolition work. 
(4)  In all cases, a fully developed site plan may be waived by the building official in lieu of a simple plat plan for small building additions, accessory buildings and structures, demolition of minor buildings or structures or other minor projects. 
(5)  In all cases, spot-in surveys are required after the foundation walls have been poured and stripped but before any superstructure is begun to verify the top of foundation wall grade and location on site. See section 6-125. 
(h)  Engineering details. The building official may require additional details of structural, mechanical and electrical work to be filed, including computations, stress diagrams, structural calculations and other essential technical data. All engineering plans and computations shall bear the seal and signature of the engineer or architect responsible for the design. Plans for buildings, other than one- and two-family buildings, more than two (2) stories in height shall indicate where penetrations will be made for electrical, plumbing, mechanical and communications conduits, pipes and systems and the materials and methods for maintaining the required structural integrity, fire resistance rating and fire stopping. When the permit application is for an addition to, or the alteration of, an existing building or structure, the building official may require an investigation of the existing structural system, heating, ventilation and air conditioning system, the plumbing system and the electrical system, any or all of the above, by licensed architects, structural or mechanical engineers, to determine the suitability and adequacy of the existing systems or component parts of the system to function properly and safely with the addition of the proposed loads, as contemplated by the permit application, plans and specifications. No permit shall be issued until the suspected systems have been approved and it has been certified that the systems can be safely added on to or modified or that any remedial work necessary to correct any deficiencies will be done concurrent with the proposed new work. All costs of such investigations shall be paid by the owner. 
(i)  Amendments to application. Amendments or changes may be made to the application or required application plans and other required documents at any time before the permit is issued, provided such changes do not substantially change or alter the project for which application has been made. If such changes do substantially alter the project, the building official may require that a new application be filed with new application documents. Amendments or changes may be made to the plans, specifications and other permit documents at any time during work in progress, subject to prior approval by the building official before such amendments or changes are built into the project. In both cases, it is the responsibility of the owner or owner's agent to file such amendments or changes in a timely manner which provides the official adequate review time. If approved, the amendment or change shall be deemed part of the original application and shall be filed therewith. 
(j)  Additional reviews and approvals. The applicant for a building permit shall also submit his plans, as necessary or required, to the village engineer, the fire department, the state fire marshal, the county health department, the state department of transportation, the county highway department and any other municipal, state or federal agency legally requiring plan review and approval before construction, depending on the requirements of the specific building permit application. Approvals of these additional agencies, as may be required, shall be forwarded to the building official and shall be a prerequisite before the issuance of the building permit. 
(k)  Certificate of insurance. 
(1)  Certificates of insurance shall be filed with the village by the general contractor, electrical contractor, and, heating ventilation and/or air conditioning contractor which shall accompany the permit applications. 
(2)  The certificates of insurance shall be from an insurance company approved by the village with at least a B+ rating. The certificate of insurance may cover all work done in the village for the term of the policy. The amounts of insurance coverage required shall be as follows:

(3)  The issuer of the certificate of insurance shall list the Village of Libertyville as a certificate holder and notify the village a minimum of ten (10) days prior to any cancellation of the insurance policy. 
(4)  The building official may waive the certificate of insurance requirement for property owners who are listed as permit applicant and general contractor and sign a statement that acknowledges responsibilities and risks inherent with general contracting; and take out permits to do their own minor alternations to their own building, or to do their own work on their own homes constructing additions, alterations, or accessory structures on private property in owner-occupied one- and two-family premises, depending on the extent of the work to be done. 
(l)  Time limitations. An application for a permit for any proposed construction work shall be deemed to have been abandoned six (6) months after the date of filing, unless such application has been diligently prosecuted or a permit shall have been issued; except that, for reasonable cause, the building official may grant an extension of time not to exceed ninety (90) days. An application shall be deemed to have been abandoned three (3) months after notification has been sent by the building official to the applicant that the permit has been approved and ready to issue and the applicant has not paid all fees and the permit has not been issued. In such cases of abandonment, the applicant shall file a new application and is subject to the then current codes and ordinances of the village.

Sec. 6-87. - Permits-Administrative procedure. 
(a)  Issuance. The building official shall examine or cause to be examined all applications for permits, and amendments thereto, under this division within a reasonable time after filing. If the application, plans or other required documents do not conform to the requirements of all pertinent laws and ordinances, the building official shall notify the applicant of the deficiencies of the application and of any additional information or data necessary to establish that the application will meet the village requirements. When the building official is satisfied that the proposed work as represented by the permit application, plans and documents conforms to the requirements of this code and all laws and ordinances applicable thereto, the building official shall issue a permit as soon as practicable. 
(b)  Expiration. If, after a permit has been issued, the operations covered by the permit shall not have begun within six (6) months after the date thereof, or if such operations are begun and then suspended or abandoned for a period of six (6) months after the time of commencing work or if such operations are begun and are not completed within one (1) year from the permit date, then such permits shall expire and no operations thereafter shall be begun or restarted or completed until a renewal of the permit shall be obtained. If the permit is not renewed as provided in subsection 6-90(k), all previous construction, if any, must be removed and the property restored to its original condition and all fees paid therefore shall be forfeited to the village and the permit shall become null and void. Further, if the permittee does not remove all previous construction and restore the property to its original conditions, the village, through and pursuant to authority of court order, its employees or its agents, shall remove same and restore the property and recover its expenses by the filing of a lien on the property, or by any other legal action permitted by law; any such removal or restoration shall be undertaken in a manner authorized by law.

One (1) set of such approved permit plans and documents shall be retained for the permanent property file records of the village and one (1) or more sets shall be returned to the applicant. There shall be a complete set of such approved permit plans and documents at the building site, and open to inspection by the building official or authorized inspectors at all reasonable times during construction. Other sets of approved permit plans shall be forwarded to such other agencies as necessary or required. 
(2)  Permit plans are reviewed by the building official with the intent that the plans and specifications comply in all respects to this code. Any omissions or errors on the approved permit plans or the specifications shall not relieve the applicant of his responsibility to comply with all applicable requirements of this code or other agencies legally having jurisdiction. 
(e)  Revocation. The building official may revoke a permit or approval issued under the provisions of this code for any false statements or misrepresentations of fact in the application or on the plans and other documents on which the permit or approval was based. 
(f)  Approval of part. The building official may issue a permit for the construction of foundations or any other part of a building or structure before the entire plans and specifications for the entire building or structure have been submitted; provided, that adequate information and detailed foundation or structural plans and calculations have been filed, showing all anticipated loads, and which comply with all pertinent requirements of this code; and further provided, that the building or structure is more than forty thousand (40,000) square feet in area and/or four (4) stories or more in height and that the building or structure is of a nature or a complexity that structural and mechanical plans, calculations and specifications will require an abnormal lead time for proper design. The holder of such permit for foundations or other parts of a building or structure shall proceed with the construction at the permit holder's own risk and without assurance that a permit for the entire building or structure will be granted. The holder of the permit shall sign a statement to that effect and shall accept full responsibility for the proper structural and mechanical mating of the substructure and superstructure. The permit holder shall be responsible for all necessary tear out, repair, replacement or any additional construction work necessary to properly complete the total building or structure.

A permit to begin work for new construction, alterations, replacement, removal, demolition, relocation or other building construction operations shall not be issued until the fees prescribed in this section shall have been paid to the village, nor shall any amendment to a permit, necessitating an additional fee, be approved until the additional fee shall have been paid. The building official may waive minimum fees for minor work or inspections. 
(b)  Basis of fees. The plan review and permit fees shall be based upon the total estimated cost of construction or alterations, as determined by and/or approved by the building official. The term "estimated cost" shall mean the current average fair market cash value of all services, labor, materials, equipment, devices and systems necessary to complete the construction work as described in the application plans and specifications, but shall not include the cost of the land or underground engineering improvement or interior furnishings. 
(c)  Special fees. The payment of the fees for the construction, alteration, replacement, removal, demolition, relocation or other building construction operations and for all other work done in connection with or concurrently with the work contemplated by a building permit shall not relieve the applicant or holder of the permit from the obligation to pay all other fees prescribed by law or ordinance, both within and outside the jurisdiction of the building division or to other village departments, divisions or agencies or to other units of county, state or federal government which legally require such fees for their services. 
(Ord. No. 16-O-21, § 3, 4-12-16) 
Sec. 6-90. - General fee schedule.

The building official may waive the fees, insurance and bonds for minor demolition. 
(g)  Reinspection fees. A reinspection fee, adequate to reimburse the village for additional expenses incurred, shall be charged on any construction work which, through negligence, incomplete work or poor workmanship on the part of the contractor, makes it necessary for the building official, inspectors or other employees, to make more than one (1) additional inspection of a single phase of construction. The fee for the third and each subsequent inspections after that shall be as established in the annual fee ordinance, and shall be paid before the next reinspection shall be made. 
(h)  Special inspections. A reinspection or special inspection, other than a reinspection pursuant to subsection (g) of this section, shall be made by the building official or his delegates, at the request of the owner of a building or of a government agency, lending or financial institution at the owner's direction and request, to determine compliance with applicable codes and ordinances of the village. The building official shall give a report of violations found, if any, to such applicant and the owner. Such reinspection or special inspection and report shall be made on application and payment of a fee as established in the annual fee ordinance, not to exceed a maximum as established in the annual fee ordinance for all inspections, to defray the expense of such reinspection or special inspection and the attendant clerical work. 
(i)  Stop work orders. When it is necessary for the building official to post and enforce a stop work order, the stop work order shall not be removed until a fee as established in the annual fee ordinance is paid to the village by the permittee to defray the additional expenses of posting, removal, forms and clerical work. 
(j)  Work started without permit. When a developer or contractor or owner begins work without a required permit, he shall be given a notice of violation in writing per subsection 6-61(b) and all illegal work shall stop until the proper permits are issued and the fee established in the annual fee ordinance is paid to the village. 
(k)  Renewal of outstanding permits. Any building permit issued as provided in this division, which has expired by the terms of subsection 6-87(b), may be renewed by the payment of an additional fee as follows: 
(1)  If a permit expires by failure of owner or agent to begin construction within six (6) months of the date of issuance of the permit, the permittee must renew the permit within the succeeding six (6) months or all fees paid therefor shall be forfeited to the village and the permit shall become null and void. A renewal fee as established in the annual fee ordinance shall be paid to the village and the permit shall be renewed for a one-year period commencing from the date of payment of the renewal fee. If the building or structure is not completed within the additional one-year period, no additional renewals of the permit shall be made, except by action of the president and board of trustees. 
(2)  If a permit expires by failure of the owner or agent to complete the building within one (1) year after the date of issuance of the permit or prior to the end of approved extensions per subection 6-87(b), the permittee must renew the permit within the succeeding three (3) months or all fees paid therefor shall be forfeited to the village and the permit shall become null and void. Furthermore, the permittee shall be required to restore the property back to its original condition by removing any construction thereon and if the permittee does not or cannot do so, the village, through its employees or its agents, may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for an order authorizing removal of same and may recover its expenses by the filing of a lien on the property or by taking any legal action permitted by law. A renewal fee as established in the annual fee ordinance shall be paid to the village and the permit shall be renewed for a one-year period, commencing from the date of payment of the renewal fee. If the building or structure is not completed within the additional one-year period, no additional renewals of the permit shall be made, except by action of the president and board of trustees. 
(l)  Cancellation of permits. If a permit has been issued and all fees have been paid and the permittee wishes to cancel the permit within the six-month period required to begin construction of the building from the date of issuance, but before construction has begun, an amount as established in the annual fee ordinance or a minimum as established in the annual fee ordinance, whichever amount is greater, shall be retained by the village for costs incurred for processing records and all other expenses, except inspection costs. If construction has begun and the permittee wishes to cancel the permit within the first six (6) months after the permit has been issued, the same cancellation fees, as above, shall be retained and the permittee must remove the construction, service the property, and restore the property back to its original condition as provided in subsection 6-87(b) before the remaining fees are returned. Circumstances not described herein shall be determined by the president and board of trustees upon the request of the building official. 
(m)  Engineering fees. When required, engineering fees for plan review, permit fees and inspection fees shall be paid at the same time as the building permit fees. A building permit shall not be issued until applicable engineering fees are either paid or waived.

Sec. 6-91. - Cash bonds-Generally. 
(a)  Cash bonds in the amount and for the types of construction as provided in section 6-92 shall be deposited with the village before either a building permit or temporary certificate of occupancy is issued which requires such cash bonds. There shall be a nonrefundable bond administration/inspection fee in an amount as established in the annual fee ordinance paid in addition to the cash bond, for the cost of administration and an inspection of the site to verify that all work has been performed in a satisfactory manner with no existing defects, faults or failures; provided, however, that no such fee shall be required for any telecommunications retailer that pays the village infrastructure maintenance fee as provided in chapter 13, article VIII of this Code. No interest shall be paid on any posted cash bond. 
(b)  The cash bonds shall be refunded upon written request to the village by the bond depositor of record or its assignee. In order to be effective, an assignment of any bond refund rights granted by this chapter, shall be evidenced by a notarized written assignment of such rights, delivered to the village and executed by the depositor of record which designates the name and address of any person or entity to whom such assignment is made. The request for refund shall list the permit number and the address of the building for which the cash bond was deposited and for which the refund is being requested. The responsible operating departments of the village shall inspect the site, certify that all requirements of the permit have been complied with by the permittee and authorize release of the cash bond through the finance department to the depositor of record. Any unapplied portion of such bonds will be returned to the depositor of record or its assignee after satisfactory completion and inspection of the site, including final grading. Cash bonds shall not be returned to the owner of the property for which the cash bond was deposited unless the owner is the depositor of record or the assignee of the depositor of record. 
(c)  The cash bonds shall not be refunded if work remains to be done or if the work is substandard and must be redone or corrected or if the permittee has failed to comply with the provisions of the permit. 
(d)  If the permittee fails, refuses, or is unable to complete the work or make additional repairs or corrections to work done, the village shall send written notice to the permittee, at the permittee's address as shown on the building permit application, that work or repairs remain to be done. If, after written notice, the work or repair is not satisfactorily completed within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice, the village may, if determined necessary by the building commissioner to abate a nuisance or for the protection of the public health, safety, or welfare, cause the work to be completed or the repairs made after utilizing bond funds to renew the permit if needed per subsection 6-87(b). 
    Payment for the work, repairs and/or renewals shall be deducted from the cash bonds and any remaining cash balance shall be refunded to the depositor of record or its assignee. If the amount of the cash bonds is not sufficient to cover all costs of the work or repairs, the full amount of the cash bonds shall be forfeited to the village and the permittee shall be billed for the difference. If the bill is not paid, the village shall either lien the property or take whatever legal action is permitted by law. No further permits shall be issued to the permittee until the balance is paid and new cash bonds are deposited. 
(e)  Cash bonds shall not be required from any corporation, company or firm for street openings or the laying or servicing of lines in the public right-of-way or easements intended as public utilities, provided there is an existing franchise agreement between the corporation, company or firm and the village in full force, which shall state that full restoration shall be made to all disturbed areas, either equal or better to that which existed prior to the franchisee's construction. 
(f)  Unclaimed cash bonds. In the event that a bond depositor of record or its assignee has failed to request the refund of a cash bond as provided by subsection 6-91(b) or if a building permit for which a cash bond has been deposited expires and is not renewed in accordance with this code, the building official shall notify the depositor of record or, where applicable, its assignee, by certified mail, return receipt requested, to arrange for a refund of any unapplied portion of the cash deposit. If, following such mailing, no request for refund is made by or on behalf of the depositor of record or its assignee, the finance department shall retain the unapplied portion of the cash bond for a period of three (3) months from the date of mailing of such mailed notice. Upon the expiration of said three-month period, any unclaimed and unapplied portion of the cash bond deposit shall be retained by the village and shall become the property of the village and neither the bond depositor of record nor its assignee shall have any further claim upon such funds.

a.  Footing inspection. All footings and pier formwork completed with all earth removed, or trench footing/wall dug out and all formwork completed, and before any concrete has been poured. 
b.  Foundation wall/drain tile inspection. Upon completion of the foundation walls, stripped of all formwork, with dampproofing applied and all footing drains installed, but before any backfilling has been done. 
c.  Rough framing inspection. When all rough structural framing, rough plumbing, electrical and HVAC has been installed, but before any insulation, drywall or other materials have been installed which would hide the rough framing or mechanical systems. 
d.  Final inspection. When the building or structure has been completed, including all systems and finishes inside of the building and all exterior work such as service walks and drives, parking areas, finished grading and landscaping, if any. 
(2)  Every new building or structure costing less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) shall be inspected at least once during construction, depending on the type of construction. 
(3)  Every new building or additions to existing buildings shall be inspected at least four (4) times. 
(4)  All remodeling or alterations to existing buildings shall be inspected at least two (2) times. 
(5)  Additional inspections may be required depending on the size and complexity of the building or structure. Additional special inspections may be required after permits expire without the project being completed. However, no more than one (1) special inspection per discipline shall be required each month. 
(e)  Work not ready for requested inspections. If, after an inspection has been requested, the work to be inspected is not completed and is not ready for inspection, the permittee or his agent shall cancel the inspection at least four (4) hours before the requested time and date. If there is no cancellation and the inspection is made and the work to be inspected is not ready for an inspection, a fee as established in the annual fee ordinance shall be required before the reinspection is made, except when unique or unusual situations occur beyond the control of the person requesting the inspection such as, but not limited to, sudden weather changes prior to a concrete pour or similar situations. If a third or subsequent inspection is necessary to approve that same work, the provisions of subsection 6-90(g) shall apply. 
(f)  Approved inspection agencies. The building official may accept reports from qualified inspection and/or testing agencies, which have been previously approved by the building official, to certify the quality of materials, the proper installation of systems and equipment or other criteria required by this code. 
(g)  Plant inspections. When required by the provisions of this code or by the approved rules, materials and assemblies shall be inspected at the point of manufacture or fabrication by an approved inspection agency and the building official shall be provided with an evaluation, test reports, certifications and similar information and data as necessary for the building official to determine conformance with this code. 
(h)  Final inspection. Upon completion of the building or structure and before the issuance of the certificate of use and occupancy required in section 6-98, a final inspection shall be requested, as per subsection (c) of this section, and the final inspection shall be made. The permit holder shall be responsible for requesting final inspections from all departments of the village and the outside agencies whose approval of the original permit application was required. All violations of the approved plans and permit provisions, this code and other applicable laws, ordinances and statutes shall be noted and all corrections shall be made before a certificate of occupancy may be issued. 
(Ord. No. 16-O-21, § 3, 4-12-16) 
Sec. 6-98. - Certificate of occupancy. 
(a)  New buildings. A new building or structure, shall not be used or occupied, in whole or in part, until a certificate of use and occupancy shall have been issued by the building official, certifying that the building or structure has been completed in accordance with the approved permit. 
(b)  Altered buildings. A building or structure enlarged, extended, altered or changed, in whole or in part, shall not be used or occupied in those parts that have been altered until the certificate shall have been issued by the building official certifying that the work has been completed in accordance with the provisions of the approved permit. 
(c)  Temporary certificate of occupancy. A temporary occupancy certificate, for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days, may be issued where there are only minor items to be completed that, in the opinion of the building official, would not adversely affect the health, welfare or safety of the occupants or the general public. A temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued for completed portions of a building that is still under construction provided that all fire suppression and alarms, mechanical and other systems, ingress and egress, fire rated materials and doors and all common elements are completed and functionable, and, in the opinion of the building official, will not adversely affect the health, welfare and safety of the occupants or the general public. Further, upon completion of the entire building, a final certificate of occupancy shall be required for the entire building and premises, which will include all areas previously issued a temporary certificate of occupancy. There shall be no initial fee for a temporary certificate of occupancy. The renewal fee for such temporary certificate of occupancy shall be as established in the annual fee ordinance. In addition, a cash bond shall be deposited with the village per section 6-91 and the annual fee schedule. This bond shall be used toward temporary occupancy and permit renewal fees with the owner and/or applicant replenishing the bond to its original amount each month. Exception: Occupied buildings, that obtain a remodeling/alteration permit, that have to relocate operations into a finished portion of the project prior to remodeling in another currently occupied area, may divide the project into phases with the fee for the temporary occupancy renewal applicable only to the final phase, provided that work proceeds continuously and a temporary occupancy agreement is secured for each phase prior to any occupancy. All conditions of (c) above will be in effect for the remainder of the project. 
(d)  Conditional temporary occupancy. A conditional temporary occupancy will be allowed for the completion of the premises or exterior of a building only when the following provisions have been met and providing that, in the opinion of the building official, the building may be occupied without endangering the health, welfare or safety of the occupants or the general public. 
(1)  When adverse circumstances beyond the control of the permittee arise such as inclement weather, winter weather, freezing weather, shutdown of material plants, adverse soil conditions or other similar adverse conditions which prohibit the completion of the exterior premises of a building, the building official may permit a temporary occupancy of the building that does not expire until either the next May 1 or when adverse circumstances beyond the control of the permittee and the community development department no longer prohibit completion of the project; provided that a cash bond of sufficient amount to guarantee the completion of all required work shall be deposited with the village based on the estimated cost of the work remaining to be done; provided also, however, that in no event shall the cash bond be less than the minimum amount established in the annual fee ordinance. Further, the prospective occupants shall sign a waiver to the effect that they acknowledge and accept the conditions prevailing on the premises without complaint. 
a.  The permittee shall fully complete all work remaining to be done within thirty (30) days after weather, soil conditions or other impediments are no longer a delaying factor, or after written notice to complete the work has been issued by the village. 
b.  If the permittee fails to, or is unable to, complete the required work within the thirty-day period, temporary occupancy renewal fees will be required as indicated above or the village may, after proper written notice to the permittee, utilize the bond amount to cause the completion of all of the defects to the final certificate of occupancy, refunding the remainder, if any, to the permittee. The building official may transfer the bond designation for use by another village department for use toward completion of that department's permitted work requirements related to and required prior to issuance of the final occupancy permit. If the bond amount is not sufficient to complete the required work, the village will bill the permittee for the balance and the certificate of occupancy shall not be issued until full payment is received. If the bill is not paid, the village shall either place a lien on the property or take whatever legal action is permitted by law. No further permits shall be issued to the permittee until the balance is paid and new cash bonds are deposited. 
(e)  Conditions to issuance. An unexecuted certificate of use and occupancy shall be filed with the assessor, and the owner of such property shall obtain from the assessor the form prescribed by such official and a receipt showing that the unexecuted certificate of occupancy has been filed and that the property is subject to increased assessment from the date of issue of the certificate on a proportionate basis for the year in which the improvement is completed. The owner of such property shall file such receipt with the building official, and a certified copy of the certificate, when issued, shall, on behalf of the village, be filed by the building official with the assessor.

(Ord. No. 18-O-55, § 3(Exh. A), 10-9-18) 
Sec. 9-2. - Findings. 
    The board of trustees finds that: 
(1)  The preservation and protection of individual trees and wooded areas serves to maintain a valuable replenishing source of oxygen. 
(2)  Established and mature trees help in the prevention of soil erosion and the absorption of water; which slows down the rate of rainfall runoff. This will assist in reducing the damages, both public and private, resulting from severe flooding events. 
(3)  Trees serve to provide a buffering of the sometimes damaging or harmful effects of exposure to the sun, cold and wind. 
(4)  Trees facilitate the filtering out of airborne pollutants, the most notable of those being carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), which is often referred to as the single most significant agent responsible for global greenhouse effects. 
(5)  The presence of trees in residential areas serves to provide visual buffers that enhance privacy, property values, and the general aesthetic appearance of the property. Such trees also serve as a buffer to noise pollution from neighboring properties. 
(6)  The preservation and protection of individual trees and wooded areas provides valuable nesting areas for birds and habitat for other forms of wildlife. 
(7)  Construction methods and practices should be adapted to increase the emphasis on the preservation of existing trees. The development, or redevelopment of property within the village should not be discouraged through the implementation of these revised practices. However, an increased emphasis should be paid to incorporate existing property resources into proposed development plans, preserving more of the original property characteristics. 
(8)  The village desires to maintain, to the greatest extent possible, existing trees within the village. Trees contribute to the scenic beauty of the village and increase property values by adding to the aesthetic quality of land. Trees also tend to soften the rough edges of developments, and reduce the visual effects of urbanization by creating a natural setting. The streetscape effect of trees is especially to be preserved. 
(Ord. No. 18-O-55, § 3(Exh. A), 10-9-18) 
Sec. 9-3. - Purpose. 
    The board of trustees declares that the purpose of this chapter is to safeguard persons, protect property, and to promote the public welfare by guiding, regulating and controlling the design, construction, use and maintenance of any property or development in a manner that prevents or minimizes the disturbance, disruption, or removal of trees and vegetative cover on land situated in the village. 
(Ord. No. 18-O-55, § 3(Exh. A), 10-9-18) 
Sec. 9-4. - Violations and penalties. 
    No person shall conduct or cause to be conducted any operations contrary to or in violation of any terms of this chapter. Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and each day during which any violation of any of the provisions of this chapter is committed shall constitute a separate offense. Upon conviction of any such violation, such person, partnership, or corporation shall be punished by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each such offense. In addition to any other penalty authorized by this section, any person, partnership, or corporation convicted of violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be required to restore the site to the condition existing prior to commission of the violation, or to bear the expense of such restoration, which such expense may become an additional charge against any security posted by the permittee. 
    In the case of unauthorized tree removal, done either without a tree removal permit or in violation of the terms of a tree removal permit or site development permit, tree replacement or remediation shall be required in accordance with the standards prescribed in section 9-32 tree mitigation requirements by a multiple of two (2).

b.  The grantee must make cable television service available to at least fifty (50) percent of the dwelling units within the service area within one (1) year from the date of the award of the franchise. 
(2)  The grantee, in its application, may propose a timetable of construction which will make cable television service available in the service area sooner than the above minimum requirements, in which case said schedule will be made part of the franchise agreement, and will be binding upon the grantee. 
(3)  Any delay beyond the terms of this timetable, unless specifically approved by the village, will be considered a violation of this article for which the provisions of either sections 13-319 or 13-327 shall apply, as determined by the village. 
(4)  In special circumstances and for good cause shown by the grantee, the village, in the exercise of its sole discretion, may waive one hundred (100) percent completion within the two-year time frame, provided that substantial completion is accomplished within the allotted time frame, substantial completion to be not less than ninety-five (95) percent. Justification for less than one hundred (100) percent must be submitted subject to the approval of the village. 
(b)  Line extensions. 
(1)  In areas of the franchise territory not initially served, a grantee shall be required to extend its system pursuant to the following requirements: 
a.  No customer shall be refused service arbitrarily. To expedite the process of extending the cable system into a new subdivision, the village will forward to the grantee an approved engineering plan of each project. Subject to the density requirements, the grantee shall commence the design and construction process upon receipt of the final engineering plan. Upon notification from the village that the first home in the project has been approved for a building permit, the grantee shall have a maximum of three (3) months to complete the construction/activation process within the applicable project phase, barring any unforeseen adverse weather or ground conditions. 
b.  The grantee shall extend and make cable television service available to every dwelling unit in all unserved, developing areas having at least twenty-five (25) dwelling units planned per street mile, as measured from the existing system, and shall extend its system simultaneously with the installation of utility lines. 
c.

(2)  In areas not meeting the requirements for mandatory extension of service, the grantee shall provide, upon the request of a potential subscriber desiring service, an estimate of the grantee's costs required to extend service to the subscriber. The grantee shall then extend service upon request of the potential subscriber. The grantee may require advance payment or assurance of payment satisfactory to the grantee. In the event the area subsequently reaches the density required for mandatory extension, such payments shall be refunded to the subscriber. 
(3)  In cases of new construction or property development where utilities are to be placed underground, all cable system facilities also shall be placed underground, except as otherwise specifically approved in advance by the village. If the grantee receives notice of such new construction or property development, including the date on which open trenching is available for the grantee's work (the "notice"), then the grantee shall provide, to the developer or property owner and to the village, the specifications for its trenching and the grantee shall install its conduit, pedestals and vaults, and laterals within five (5) working days after the trenches first become available to the grantee for such work. Costs of trenching and easements required to bring service to the development shall be borne by the developer or property owner; provided, however, that if the grantee fails to install its conduit, pedestals and vaults, and laterals within said five (5) working days, then the cost of any new trenching, and easements if necessary, shall be borne by the grantee. The notice may be given to the grantee at the address stated in the franchise agreement or to the local general manager or system engineer of the grantee. Written or oral notice from the developer, property owner, or village shall be sufficient to qualify as the notice. 
(c)  Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the grantee from serving areas of the village not covered under this section upon agreement with developers, property owners, residents, or businesses, provided that all applicable fees are paid by the grantee to the village therefor, including without limitation the franchise fee provided in this article. 
(d)  A grantee, in its new or renewal application, may propose a line extension policy that will result in serving more residents of the village than as required above, in which case the grantee's policy will be incorporated into the franchise agreement and will be binding on the grantee. 
(e)  The violation of this section shall be considered a violation of this article for which the provisions of either sections 13-319 or 13-327 shall apply, as determined by the village. 
(Ord. No. 97-O-75, § 2, Exh. A (§ 21), 9-23-97) 
Sec. 13-302. - Construction and technical standards. 
(a)  The grantee shall construct, install, operate and maintain its system in a manner consistent with all laws, ordinances, construction standards, governmental requirements, and FCC technical standards. In addition, the grantee shall provide the village, upon request, a written report of the results of the grantee's annual proof of performance tests conducted pursuant to Federal Communications Commission standards and requirements. 
(b)  The following additional specifications shall apply: 
(1)  Construction, installation and maintenance of the cable television system shall be performed in an orderly and workmanlike manner. All cables and wires shall be installed, where possible, parallel with electric and telephone lines. Multiple cable configurations shall be arranged in parallel and bundled with due respect for engineering considerations.

FCC rules and regulations shall govern. 
(7)  The grantee shall maintain equipment capable of providing standby power for headend, transportation and trunk amplifiers for a minimum of two (2) hours. 
(8)  In all areas of the village where the cables, wires and other like facilities of public utilities are placed underground, all cables, wires and other like facilities of the grantee installed after the effective date of the grantee's franchise shall be placed underground. When public utilities relocate their facilities from pole to underground, the grantee shall concurrently do so at no expense to the village. 
(c)  Plans and permits. 
(1)  Right to review; briefings. 
a.  The village shall have the right to review the grantee's construction plans and specifications prior to the commencement of any new construction to assure compliance with the standards specified in this article and to inspect all aspects of cable system construction. The village shall not, however, be required to review or approve such plans and specifications or to make such inspections, and the village specifically disclaims such obligation. The grantee shall be solely responsible for taking all steps necessary to assure compliance with such standards and to ensure that the cable system is installed in a safe manner and pursuant to the terms and conditions of this article and the franchise agreement. 
b.  Before beginning new construction of, or on any part of, the cable system, the grantee's chief engineer or designated individual shall meet with the village administrator or designated individual to explain the grantee's construction plans and work program in detail. Similar briefings shall be held from time to time as deemed necessary by either the village or the grantee until the work is completed. 
(2)  The grantee shall, within ninety (90) days after the effective date of its franchise, furnish to the village complete "as-built" plans of the cable system and shall, thereafter, furnish to the village amendments to such plans within forty-five (45) days after completion of any extension or modification of the cable system. If so requested by the grantee, the village shall keep such as-built plans confidential to the extent allowable by law, and shall show such plans only to those employees, contractors or village officials who need to see them as a part of their responsibilities to the village, or pursuant to their J.U.L.I.E. responsibilities. 
(3)  The grantee shall obtain permits from the village before commencing any new construction of or within the cable system, with specific permission being required for the opening or disturbance of any public way within the village. The permit application shall include a plan drawn in sufficient detail to demonstrate to the village that the cable system will be constructed in accordance with all applicable codes and ordinances. Where cable is to be installed on existing poles, the permit application shall include a drawing showing the existing poles and additional poles, if requested. Without characterizing the violation of other provisions of this article, the failure to obtain said permits shall constitute a material violation of this article. The grantee also, before the commencement of new construction of, or on any part of, the cable system, shall become and remain a member of the J.U.L.I.E. system. 
(d)  All work involved in the construction, operation, maintenance, repair, and removal of the cable system, or any part thereof, shall be performed in a workmanlike manner using materials of good and durable quality. If, at any time, it is determined by the village or any other agency or authority of competent jurisdiction that any part of the cable system, including without limitation any means used to distribute signals over or within the cable system, is harmful to the health or safety of any person, then the grantee, at its sole cost and expense, shall promptly correct all such conditions. Any contractor, subcontractor, or other person proposed to be employed for the installation, maintenance, relocation, or repair of cable system equipment or facilities shall be licensed in accordance with applicable laws and shall be thoroughly experienced in the work for which he or she is retained. 
(e)  Unless expressly provided otherwise in the franchise, the grantee shall at all times comply with any and all rules and regulations enacted or to be enacted by the village with reference to construction activity in public ways. All poles, wires, conduits, cables, equipment, pipes, appurtenances, structures, and other facilities of the cable system shall be installed and located in compliance with all applicable village codes and ordinances and the applicable provisions of the franchise so as to cause minimum interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of the general public, all as determined by the village in its sole and absolute discretion. Unless the village shall in writing waive its right to review plans, no construction or other work relating to such facilities within the public ways of the village shall be commenced until the village shall have approved and issued a permit on the plans, specifications and methods for such work. Any such permit may be so conditioned or restricted as deemed necessary by the village to assure compliance with the franchise and to protect the public health and safety. All such facilities shall at all times be kept and maintained in a safe condition and in good order and repair. The grantee shall at all times employ reasonable care and shall install, maintain, and use commonly accepted methods and devices for preventing failures and accidents that are likely to cause damage, injuries or nuisances to the general public. Suitable barricades, flags, lights, flares or other devices shall be used at such times and places as are required by applicable ordinances and at such additional times and places as are required for the safety of all members of the general public. Any such facilities placed in any public way by the grantee shall be placed and maintained in such a manner as not to interfere with the usual travel or other existing or projected uses of such public way. 
(f)  Excavation work and time periods. 
(1)  No excavation on or in any public way, public property or private property in the village permitted hereunder in connection with the installation of any cable system facilities shall be made more than twenty-four (24) hours immediately before installation of such facilities. The grantee may apply for a waiver in unusual circumstances. 
(2)  The grantee shall notify the village administrator at least seventy-two (72) hours before any excavation on or in any public way, public property or private property so that the village administrator will have the opportunity to inspect such excavation work. 
(3)  All excavations in lawns or grassy parkways shall be promptly backfilled, tamped and restored with sod in accordance with the applicable provisions of this article. 
(g)  Location of pedestals and vaults. 
(1)  Pedestals and similar aboveground appurtenances. 
a.  The village has determined that pedestals and similar aboveground appurtenances located on a public way (other than in an alley or as provided in paragraph c. below) or on public property will adversely affect the appearance of the village and of the property therein and, accordingly, pursuant to section 541(a)(2) of the Cable Act, the grantee shall not under any circumstances install or locate a pedestal or any similar above ground appurtenance on any public way (other than in an alley or as provided in paragraph c. below) or on any public property as a part of any new construction or any relocation or reinstallation. 
b.  Pedestals or similar above ground appurtenances may be installed on private property only with the express, prior written consent and permission of the affected property owner or his or her authorized agent, or the duly elected or appointed representative of the affected property; provided, however, that such pedestals or above ground appurtenances shall comply with all applicable provisions of this Code. 
c.  Notwithstanding paragraph b. above, pedestals or similar above ground appurtenances may be installed within certain utility easements on private property without the consent or permission of the affected property owner provided that (i) the grantee is lawfully authorized to use such utility easement pursuant to state or federal law; (ii) no such pedestal or similar above ground appurtenance may be installed unless, at the time of the desired installation, there exists within the utility easement, a similar above ground appurtenance of another utility company or entity; and (iii) the grantee's pedestal or similar above ground appurtenance shall be located as close as is practicable to said existing above ground appurtenance. 
(2)  Vaults. 
a.  The grantee shall not install underground vaults on any public way after the effective date of this franchise, except in accordance with and pursuant to the provisions of paragraph d. of this subsection. All underground vaults shall be flush mounted with the surface of the land area. 
b.  The grantee shall inform the owner of any private property in the village where the grantee contemplates placing a vault on the parkway immediately adjacent to said private property, that the owner has the right to elect between the construction and installation of an underground vault on the owner's private property or on the public way (including, without limitation, the parkway) immediately adjacent to the owner's property. Said notice shall be in writing, in form and substance acceptable to the village administrator, and delivered by certified mail or personal delivery to said owner at least thirty (30) days immediately before the commencement of construction on or around the owner's property. 
c.  If the owner elects to allow construction and installation of an underground vault on the owner's property, then the owner shall be required to grant the grantee and easement, in form reviewed and approved by the village attorney, allowing for such construction and installation. 
d.  If the owner (i) elects not to allow construction and installation of an underground vault on the owner's property; or (ii) fails to respond to the election notice delivered by the grantee pursuant to paragraph b. above within forty-five (45) days after the owner receives the notice; or (iii) refuses to grant the grantee the easement pursuant to paragraph c. above within thirty (30) days after the owner's receipt of an easement document, then the grantee shall be entitled to construct and install an underground vault on the public way (including, without limitation, the parkway) that is immediately adjacent to the owner's property.

Sec. 13-303. - Use of streets. 
(a)  The grantee's system, poles, wires and appurtenances shall be located, erected and maintained so that none of its facilities shall endanger or interfere with the lives of persons or interfere with the rights or reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the streets and public ways, or interfere with any improvements the village may make, or hinder or obstruct the free use of the streets, alleys, bridges, easements or public property. 
(b)  In case of any disturbance of pavement, sidewalk, landscaping, driveway or other surfacing, the grantee shall, at its own cost and expense and in a manner approved by the village, replace and restore all paving, sidewalk, driveway, landscaping, or surface of any street or alley disturbed, in at least as good condition as before the work was commenced and in accordance with standards for such work set by the village. If, after thirty (30) days, restoration measures are not performed to the reasonable satisfaction of the village, the village may undertake remedial restoration activities, such activities to be performed at the grantee's cost, with such costs to be chargeable against the security deposit required of the grantee in subsection 13-294(e). 
(c)  Erection, removal and common uses of poles. 
(1)  No poles or other wire-holding structures shall be erected by the grantee without prior approval of the village with regard to location, height, types, and any other pertinent aspect. However, no location of any pole or wire-holding structure of the grantee shall be a vested interest and such poles or structures shall be removed or modified by the grantee at its own expense whenever the village determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. 
(2)  Where poles or other wire-holding structures already existing for use in serving the village are available for use by the grantee, but it does not make arrangements for such use, the village may require the grantee to use such poles and structures if it determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby and the terms of the use available to the grantee are just and reasonable. 
(3)  Where the village or a public utility serving the village desires to make use of the poles or other wire-holding structures of the grantee, but agreement thereof with the grantee cannot be reached, the village may require the grantee to permit such use for such consideration and upon such terms as the village shall determine to be just and reasonable, if the village determines that the use would enhance the public convenience and would not unduly interfere with the grantee's operations. 
(d)  If at any time during the period of the franchise the village shall elect to alter, or change the grade of any street, alley or other public ways or utilities, the grantee, upon reasonable notice by the village, shall promptly remove or relocate as necessary its poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes and other fixtures at its own expense. 
(e)  The grantee shall, on the request of any person holding a building moving permit issued by the village, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of buildings. The expense of such temporary removal, raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the person requesting the same, and the grantee shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. The grantee shall be given not less than forty-eight (48) hours advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes. 
(f)  The grantee shall not remove any tree or trim any portion, either above, at or below ground level, of any tree within any public place without the prior consent of the village. The grantee shall provide notice to any affected residents at the same time that the grantee applies to the village for consent to perform tree trimming. The village shall have the right to do the trimming requested by the grantee at the cost of the grantee. Regardless of who performs the work requested by the grantee, the grantee shall be responsible, shall defend and hold village harmless from any and all damages to any tree as a result of trimming, or to the property surrounding any tree, whether such tree is trimmed or removed. 
(g)  The grantee shall not use road cuts for the laying of cable or wires without the prior approval of the village. 
(h)  The right of the grantee to use and occupy the public ways shall not be exclusive. The village reserves the right to grant any right or use of such public ways to any person at any time during the term of the franchise or any other franchise subsequently granted to any other person. 
(i)  If any public way or portion thereof used by the grantee shall be vacated by the village, or the use thereof discontinued by the village or the grantee, during the term of the franchise, then the grantee shall forthwith at its sole cost and expense remove its facilities therefrom unless specifically permitted to continue to use the same and, on the removal thereof, the grantee shall restore, repair, or reconstruct the public way area where such removal has occurred to its original condition as required by the village. In the event of any failure, neglect, or refusal by the grantee, after thirty (30) days written notice from the village to repair, improve, or maintain such public way, the village may, but shall be under no obligation to, conduct such work, or cause it to be conducted, and the actual cost thereof shall be paid by the grantee in the time and manner as directed by the village. Collection may be made by resort to the letter of credit or cash security deposit established pursuant to section 13-294, or by court action, or otherwise.

Sec. 13-304. - Operational standards. 
(a)  The grantee shall maintain all parts of the system in good condition throughout the entire franchise period. 
(b)  Upon the reasonable request for service by any person located within the franchise territory, the grantee shall, within thirty (30) days, furnish the requested service to such person within terms of the line extension policy. A request for service shall be unreasonable for the purpose of this subsection if no trunk line installation capable of servicing that person's block has been installed. 
(c)  Temporary service drops. 
(1)  The grantee shall put forth every effort to bury temporary drops within ten (10) working days after placement. Any delays for any other reason than listed will be communicated to the village. The following delays will be found understandable and within the course of doing business: weather, ground conditions, street bores, system redesign requirements and any other unusual obstacle, such as obstructive landscaping that is created by the customer. 
(2)  Upon request of the village the grantee shall provide a monthly report to the village on the number of drops pending. 
(d)  The grantee shall render efficient service, make repairs promptly, and interrupt service only for good cause and for the shortest time possible. Such interruptions, insofar as possible, shall be preceded by notice and shall occur during periods of minimum system use.

All other regular service requests will be responded to within thirty-six (36) hours during the normal work week for that system. The appointment window alternatives for installations, service calls and other installation activities will be: "morning" or "afternoon"; not to exceed a four-hour "window" during normal business hours for the system, or at a time that is mutually acceptable. The grantee shall schedule supplemental hours during which appointments can be scheduled based on the needs of the community. If at any time an installer or technician is running late, an attempt to contact the customer will be made and the appointment rescheduled as necessary at a time that is convenient to the customer.

(1)  If a subscriber experiences a service interruption totaling four (4) hours or more on one (1), two (2), or three (3) days in any calendar month, then the grantee shall provide a credit to that subscriber equal to one-thirtieth ( 1/30 ) of one (1) month's total fees paid by that subscriber for each day on which such a service interruption occurs; provided, however, that such credit shall not apply to a subscriber disconnected because of non-payment or excessive signal leakage. Such credit shall be provided by the grantee automatically upon notice from that subscriber of such service interruption, regardless of whether that subscriber requests a credit. 
(2)  If a subscriber experiences a service interruption totaling four (4) hours or more on four (4) or more days in any calendar month, then the grantee shall provide a credit to that subscriber equal to one (1) month's total fees paid by that subscriber; provided, however, that such credit shall not apply to a subscriber disconnected because of non-payment or excessive signal leakage. Such credit shall be provided by the grantee automatically upon notice from that subscriber of the fourth such service interruption, regardless of whether that subscriber requests a credit. 
(f)  The grantee shall provide written information for each of the following areas at the time of installation and at any future time upon the request of the customer:

Should the village find, by resolution, that the grantee has failed to maintain these technical standards and quality of service, and should it, by resolution, specifically enumerate improvements to be made, the grantee shall make such improvements. Failure to make such improvements within three (3) months of such resolution will constitute a breach of a condition for which penalties contained in section 13-327 are applicable. 
(m)  The grantee shall keep a monthly service log which indicates the nature of each service complaint received in the last twenty-four (24) months, the date and time each complaint was received, the disposition of each complaint, and the time and date thereof. This log shall be sent to the village monthly upon request.

Sec. 13-306. - Continuity of service mandatory. 
(a)  It shall be the right of all subscribers to continue receiving service as long as their financial and other obligations to the grantee are honored. If the grantee elects to over build, rebuild, modify or sell the system, or the village gives notice of intent to terminate or fails to renew the franchise, the grantee shall act so as to ensure that all subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted service regardless of the circumstances for a period not to exceed six (6) months after the franchise has terminated. 
(b)  If there is a change of franchise, or if a new operator acquires the system, the grantee shall cooperate with the village, new franchisee and operator in maintaining continuity of service to all subscribers. During such period, the grantee shall be entitled to the revenues for any period during which it operates the system. 
(c)  If the grantee fails to operate the system for three (3) consecutive days without prior approval of the village or without just cause, the village may, at its option, operate the system or designate an operator until such time as the grantee restores service under conditions acceptable to the village or a permanent operator is selected. If the village is required to fulfill this obligation for the grantee, the village shall be entitled to all revenues for any period during which it operates the system and shall be entitled to draw on the letter of credit and cash security deposit established pursuant to section 13-294 to recover all of its costs and damages in excess of such revenues, and, in any event, the grantee shall be obligated to reimburse the village for all costs or damages incurred by the village resulting from the grantee's failure to perform that the village does not recover from such revenues or said letter of credit or cash security deposit.

(1)  The nature of the complaint or problem that precipitated the special tests; 
(2)  The system component(s) tested; 
(3)  The equipment used and procedures employed in testing; 
(4)  The method, if any, in which such complaint or problem was resolved; and 
(5)  Any other information pertinent to the tests and analysis which may be required. 
(d)  If, after receiving grantee's report, and after the grantee has completed any corrective action identified in the report, the village determines that reasonable evidence still exists of inadequate system performance, then the village may enlist an independent engineer at grantee's expense to perform tests and analysis directed toward such suspected failures to meet the requirements of this article. Grantee shall cooperate and permit such testing. 
(e)  The village shall require tests, analysis and reports covering specific subjects and characteristics based on complaints or other evidence only when the village has reasonable grounds to believe that the complaints or other evidence require that tests be performed to protect the public against substandard cable service.

Sec. 13-308. - Grantee rules and regulations. 
    The grantee shall have the authority to promulgate such rules, regulations, terms, and conditions governing the conduct of its business as shall be reasonably necessary to enable the grantee to exercise its rights and perform its obligations under the franchise, and to assure uninterrupted service to each and all of its customers; provided, however, that such rules, regulations, terms and conditions shall not be in conflict with the provisions hereof or applicable state and federal laws, rules and regulations. 
(Ord. No. 97-O-75, § 2, Exh. A (§ 28), 9-23-97) 
Sec. 13-309. - Franchise fee. 
(a)  A grantee shall pay to the village a franchise fee of not less than five (5) percent of the grantee's gross revenues or such other maximum amount as allowed by law. 
(b)  The franchise fee payment shall be in addition to any other tax or payment owed to the village by the grantee and shall not be construed as payment in lieu of municipal property taxes or other state, county or local taxes. 
(c)  The franchise fee and any other costs or penalties assessed shall be payable quarterly on a calendar year basis to the village within thirty (30) days after the end of each quarter. The grantee shall also file a complete and accurate verified statement of all gross receipts as previously defined within said thirty (30) days. 
(d)  The village shall have the right to inspect and copy the grantee's income records and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this article. Any additional amount due the village as a result of an audit shall be paid within thirty (30) days following written notice to the grantee by the village, which notice shall include a copy of the audit report. If any audit discloses an underpayment of a franchise fee by an amount in excess of five (5) percent of the applicable fee, then the grantee shall pay the full cost of the audit. The grantee shall maintain books and records of its operations within and related to the village and the grantee's cable system in sufficient detail to show gross revenue, by service category, consistent with generally accepted accounting principles. Said books and records shall be retained in accordance with the grantee's document retention policies, but in no event less than five (5) years. 
(e)  If any franchise payment or re-computed amount, cost or penalty, is not made on or before the applicable dates heretofore specified, interest shall be charged daily from such date at an annual rate of twelve (12) percent. 
(f)  The acceptance by the village of any franchise fee payment shall not in any way be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of any payment be construed as a release of any claim the village may have for further or additional sums payable under the provisions of the franchise. All franchise fee payments shall be subject to audit and re-computation by the village in accordance with this section. 
(g)  The grantee shall acknowledge as follows: 
(1)  The franchise fee is not a tax; and 
(2)  The franchise fee shall be in addition to any and all taxes, other fees or charges that the grantee or any affiliate shall be required to pay to the village or to any state or federal agency or authority, all of which shall be separate and distinct obligations of the grantee and its affiliates; and 
(3)  Neither the grantee nor any affiliate shall have or make any claim for any deduction or other credit of all or any part of the franchise fee from or against any of said village taxes or other fees or charges that the grantee or any affiliate is required to pay to the village except as may be identified and authorized by federal law; and 
(4)  Neither the grantee nor any affiliate shall apply or seek to apply all or any part of the franchise fee as a deduction or other credit from or against any of said village taxes or other fees or charges, each of which shall be deemed to be separate and distinct obligations of the grantee and its affiliates. 
(5)  Except as authorized by law, if the grantee or any affiliate applies or seeks to apply all or any part of the amount of the franchise fee as a deduction or other credit from or against any village tax or other fee or charge, or if the grantee or any affiliate applies or seeks to apply all or any part of any such tax or other fee or charge as a deduction or other credit from or against the franchise fee, then, in any such event, the village may revoke the franchise pursuant to the applicable provisions of this article without any liability to the grantee or any affiliate. 
(h)  The village may increase the franchise fee if and to the extent that the maximum allowable franchise fee is increased by the FCC. If the village desires to increase the franchise fee in that event, then the village shall provide at least thirty (30) days written notice to the grantee. If, within thirty (30) days after the village's notice, the grantee so requests, the village shall conduct a public hearing on the franchise fee increase. The effective date of the proposed franchise fee increase shall be delayed until the expiration of the thirty-day notice period, if within that period the grantee does not request a hearing, or if a hearing is requested, until the conclusion of the public hearing conducted pursuant to this subsection. 
(Ord. No. 97-O-75, § 2, Exh. A (§ 29), 9-23-97) 
Sec. 13-310. - Transfer of ownership or control. 
(a)  Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section below, a franchise shall not be assigned, transferred, pledged, leased, sublet, hypothecated, or mortgaged, either in whole or in part, in any manner, nor shall title thereto, either legal or equitable or any right, interest or property therein, pass to or vest in any person without the prior written approval of the village. The grantee may, however, transfer or assign the franchise to a wholly owned subsidiary of the grantee and such subsidiary may transfer or assign the franchise back to the grantee without such consent, providing that such assignment is without any release of liability of the grantee. Any proposed assignee must show legal, technical and financial responsibility as determined by the village and must agree to comply with all provisions of the franchise. The grantee shall submit a petition to the village requesting the village's approval at least ninety (90) days before the grantee takes any action in furtherance of accomplishing any such assignment, transfer, pledge, lease, sublet, hypothecation, or mortgage, containing or accompanied by such information as is required in accordance with FCC regulations and by the village. The village shall have one hundred twenty (120) days to act upon any request for approval of any such assignment, transfer, pledge, lease, sublet, hypothecation, or mortgage. The village shall be deemed to have consented to a proposed assignment, transfer, pledge, lease, sublet, hypothecation, or mortgage if its refusal to consent is not communicated in writing to the grantee within one hundred twenty (120) days following receipt of said petition and receipt of all necessary information as to the effect of the proposed assignment, transfer, pledge, lease, sublet, hypothecation, or mortgage upon the public, unless the requesting party and the village agree to an extension of time. The village shall not unreasonably withhold consent to a proposed transfer. 
(b)  The grantee shall promptly notify the village of any actual or proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of, control of the grantee. The word "control" as used herein is not limited to major stockholders but also includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or accumulation by any person or group of persons of five (5) percent of the voting shares of the grantee. Change, transfer or acquisition of control of the grantee without the village's consent shall make the franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the village shall have consented thereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer or acquisition of control, the village may inquire into the qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the grantee shall assist the village in such inquiry. 
(c)  The consent or approval of the village to any transfer of the grantee shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the village in and to any public way, and any transfer shall by its terms, be expressly subordinate to the terms and conditions of the franchise. 
(d)  In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the village shall not be required to approve any transfer or assignment of a new franchise prior to substantial completion of construction of the proposed system. 
(e)  In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be approved without the successor(s) in interest becoming a signatory to the franchise agreement. 
(f)  Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prohibit any assignment, pledge, lease, sublease, mortgage, or other transfer of all or any part of the grantee's cable system, or any right or interest therein, solely for financing purposes, provided that each such assignment, pledge, lease, sublease, mortgage, or other transfer shall be subject and subordinate to the rights of the village pursuant to this article, the franchise agreement, and applicable law.

(b)  The following records and/or reports shall be sent to the village, but no more frequently than on a quarterly basis if so mutually agreed upon by the grantee and the village: 
(1)  A quarterly review and resolution or progress report submitted by the grantee to the village; 
(2)  Periodic preventive maintenance reports; 
(3)  Any copies of FCC Form 395-A (or successor form) or any supplemental forms related to equal opportunity or fair contracting policies; 
(4)  Subscriber inquiry/complaint resolution data and the right to review documentation concerning these inquiries and/or complaints periodically; and 
(5)  Periodic construction update reports including, where appropriate, the submission of as-built maps.

(Ord. No. 97-O-75, § 2, Exh. A (§ 33), 9-23-97) 
Sec. 13-314. - Removal of cable system. 
    At the expiration of the term for which the franchise is granted or when any renewal is denied, or upon its termination as provided herein, the grantee shall forthwith, upon notice by the village, remove at its own expense all portions of the cable television system designated by the village from all streets and public property within the village. If the grantee fails to do so, the village may perform the work at the grantee's expense. Upon such notice of removal, a bond shall be furnished by the grantee in an amount sufficient to cover this expense as determined by the village. 
(Ord. No. 97-O-75, § 2, Exh. A (§ 34), 9-23-97)

(a)  The grantee shall make available to all subscribers the option to receive not fewer than eighty-five (85) channels. 
(b)  If the grantee serves the village pursuant to an agreement only with the village and not by agreement negotiated as part of a collective process with other franchising authorities, then the grantee shall maintain not fewer than one (1) specially designated noncommercial channel for the exclusive use of the village and other public, educational, and governmental authorities in the village. The grantee shall not make use of any channel reserved for use pursuant to this subsection (b). 
(c)  If the grantee receives its franchise within the village pursuant to an agreement negotiated as part of a collective process among, and the grantee's system thus serves, the village and other franchising authorities including the villages of Grayslake, Mundelein, and Wauconda and the County of Lake (collectively the "authorities"), then the grantee shall maintain at least five (5) channels of its system exclusively available as follows: 
(1)  At least one (1) specially designated noncommercial channel for use by all local library authorities within the corporate limits of the authorities; 
(2)  At least one (1) specially designated noncommercial channel for use by all local educational authorities within the corporate limits of the authorities; 
(3)  At least one (1) specially designated noncommercial channel for use by all local governmental agencies within the corporate limits of the authorities;

(5)  At least one (1) specially designated noncommercial channel for use by the authorities as an interactive video bulletin board. 
    The authorities may allocate the use of such channels among the entities listed above in such manner as the authorities determine is appropriate. 
    For any system that serves the village and other franchising authorities as described in this subsection (c) and that has the capacity for any number of channels greater than eight-five (85), the grantee shall provide, in addition to the channels otherwise required pursuant to this subsection (c), two (2) specially designated noncommercial channels for the exclusive use of the village and other local governmental, educational, and public authorities, subject to the conditions set forth in the next two (2) sentences. Such two (2) additional channels shall be provided immediately upon notice from the village of sufficient demand therefor. For purposes of this requirement, the phrase "sufficient demand" shall mean that four (4) of the five (5) specially designated noncommercial channels otherwise required pursuant to this subsection (c) are used for original, noncommercial public, educational, and governmental access video programming not less than an average of six (6) hours per day, five (5) days each week, over a period of forty-five (45) days. 
    The grantee shall not make use of any channel reserved for use pursuant to this subsection (c); provided, however, that the grantee may use the two (2) channels described in the immediately preceding paragraph but only until receipt of notice from the village pursuant to the second sentence of the preceding paragraph. 
(d)  Studios and associated production equipment will be located in a mutually agreed upon site to meet the public's need for public access, and to accommodate the specially designated channels described in this paragraph. Financial and technical support and replacement and maintenance of equipment for such facilities shall be separately incorporated into the franchise by agreement. 
(e)  The grantee shall incorporate into its cable television system the capacity to permit the village, in times of emergency, to override by remote control the audio, video and/or text of all channels, simultaneously, which the grantee may lawfully override. The grantee shall provide emergency broadcast capacity pursuant to FCC rules. The grantee shall cooperate with the village in the use and operation of the emergency alert system. 
(f)  Interconnection. 
(1)  The grantee shall, on request by the village, connect its cable system within the village to any cable system that is owned or operated by the grantee or any affiliate or subsidiary of the grantee in any contiguous municipality. 
(2)  The village also may request that the grantee interconnect its system with other communication facilities within or contiguous to the village. Such interconnection shall be negotiated by the village and the grantee. Upon receiving a request from the village to so interconnect, the grantee shall immediately initiate negotiations with the other affected system or systems in order that all costs may be shared equally among cable companies for both construction and operation of the interconnection link. 
The grantee may be granted reasonable extensions of time to interconnect, or the village shall rescind its request to interconnect, upon petition by the grantee to the village, if the grantee has negotiated in good faith and has arrived at impasse with the operator or franchising authority of the system to be interconnected, or that the cost of the interconnection would cause an unreasonable or unacceptable increase in subscriber rates, or that the interconnection is technically infeasible. 
(3)  The grantee shall cooperate with any interconnection corporation, regional interconnection authority, municipality, or county, state, or federal regulatory agency that may be hereafter established for the purpose of regulating, financing, or otherwise providing for the interconnection of cable systems beyond the boundaries of the village. 
(g)  The grantee shall provide such additional services and facilities as are contained in its application.

The village shall cause to be served upon the grantee, at least twenty (20) days prior to the date of such meeting, a written notice of intent to request such termination and the time and place of the meeting. 
(c)  The village board shall hear and consider the issues and shall hear any person interested therein and shall determine in its discretion whether any violation by the grantee has occurred.

The written notice shall describe in reasonable detail the specific violation so as to afford the grantee an opportunity to remedy the violation. The grantee shall have thirty (30) days subsequent to the date of such notice in which to correct the violation before the village may impose penalties unless the violation is, in the opinion of the village, of such a nature so as to require more than thirty (30) days and the grantee proceeds, immediately upon receipt of such notice, and continuously, and diligently, to correct the violation.

(b)  The grantee may, within ten (10) days of receipt of notice, notify the village that there is a dispute as to whether a violation or failure has, in fact, occurred. Such notice by the grantee to the village shall specify with particularity the matters disputed by the grantee and shall stay the running of the thirty-day cure period pending board decision as required below.

--- (10) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 05-O-71, § 3, adopted Sept. 13, 2005, set out provisions intended for use as Art. XII. Inasmuch as there were already provisions so designated, the provisions have been redesignated as Art. XIII. See the editor's note to Art. VIII for pertinent information regarding this Art. XIII.

    Amount paid means the amount charged to the taxpayer's service address in this municipality regardless of where such amount is billed or paid. 
    Department means the Illinois Department of Revenue. 
    Gross charge means the amount paid for the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in this municipality and for all services and equipment provided in connection therewith by a retailer, valued in money whether paid in money or otherwise, including cash, credits, services and property of every kind or nature, and shall be determined without any deduction on account of the cost of such telecommunications, the cost of the materials used, labor or service costs or any other expense whatsoever. In case credit is extended, the amount thereof shall be included only as and when paid. "Gross charges" for private line service shall include charges imposed at each channel point within this municipality, charges for the channel mileage between each channel point within this municipality, and charges for that portion of the interstate inter-office channel provided within Illinois. However, "gross charge" shall not include: 
(1)  Any amounts added to a purchaser's bill because of a charge made pursuant to: (i) the tax imposed by this article, (ii) the tax imposed by the Telecommunications Excise Tax Act, (iii) the tax imposed by section 4251 of the Internal Revenue Code, (iv) 911 surcharges, or (v) charges added to customers' bills pursuant to the provisions of section 9-221 or 9-222 of the Public Utilities Act, as amended, or any similar charges added to customers' bills by retailers who are not subject to rate regulation by the Illinois Commerce Commission for the purpose of recovering any of the tax liabilities or other amounts specified in those provisions of the Public Utilities Act; 
(2)  Charges for a sent collect telecommunication received outside of such municipality; 
(3)  Charges for leased time on equipment or charges for the storage of data or information for subsequent retrieval or the processing of data or information intended to change its form or content.

(6)  Charges for telecommunications and all services and equipment provided in connection therewith between a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries when the tax imposed under this article has already been paid to a retailer and only to the extent that the charges between the parent corporation and wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries represent expense allocation between the corporations and not the generation of profit for the corporation rendering such service; 
(7)  Bad debts ("bad debt" means any portion of a debt that is related to a sale at retail for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible or excludable that has become worthless or uncollectible, as determined under applicable federal income tax standards; if the portion of the debt deemed to be bad is subsequently paid, the retailer shall report and pay the tax on that portion during the reporting period in which the payment is made);

    Purchase at retail means the acquisition, consumption or use of telecommunications through a sale at retail. 
    Retailer means and includes every person engaged in the business of making sales at retail as defined in this section. The department may, in its discretion, upon application, authorize the collection of the tax hereby imposed by any retailer not maintaining a place of business within this state, who, to the satisfaction of the department, furnishes adequate security to insure collection and payment of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued, without charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be the duty of such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges for telecommunications in this state in the same manner and subject to the same requirements as a retailer maintaining a place of business within this state. The permit may be revoked by the department at its discretion. 
    Retailer maintaining a place of business in this state , or any like term, means and includes any retailer having or maintaining within this state, directly or by a subsidiary, an office, distribution facilities, transmission facilities, sales office, warehouse or other place of business, or any agent or other representative operating within this state under the authority of the retailer or its subsidiary, irrespective of whether such place of business or agent or other representative is located here permanently or temporarily, or whether such retailer or subsidiary is licensed to do business in this state. 
    Sale at retail means the transmitting, supplying or furnishing of telecommunications and all services and equipment provided in connection therewith for a consideration, to persons other than the federal and state governments, and state universities created by statute and other than between a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries for their use or consumption and not for resale. 
    Service address means the location of telecommunications equipment from which telecommunications services are originated or at which telecommunications services are received by a taxpayer. In the event this may not be a defined location, as in the case of mobile phones, paging systems, and maritime systems, service address means the customer's place of primary use as defined in the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Conformity Act. For air-to-ground systems and the like, "service address" shall mean the location of a taxpayer's primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number, authorization code, or location in Illinois where bills are sent. 
    Taxpayer means a person who individually or through his or her agents, employees, or permittees engages in the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in a municipality and who incurs a tax liability as authorized by the ordinance [from which this article derives]. 
    Telecommunications, in addition to the meaning ordinarily and popularly ascribed to it, includes, without limitation, messages or information transmitted through use of local, toll, and wide area telephone service, private line services, channel services, telegraph services, teletypewriter, computer exchange services, cellular mobile telecommunications service, specialized mobile radio, stationary two-way radio, paging service, or any other form of mobile and portable one-way or two-way communications, or any other transmission of messages or information by electronic or similar means, between or among points by wire, cable, fiber optics, laser, microwave, radio, satellite, or similar facilities. As used in this article, "private line" means a dedicated non-traffic sensitive service for a single customer, that entitles the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other specified locations. The definition of "telecommunications" shall not include value added services in which computer processing applications are used to act on the form, content, code, and protocol of the information for purposes other than transmission. "Telecommunications" shall not include purchases of telecommunications by a telecommunications service provider for use as a component part of the service provided by such provider to the ultimate retail consumer who originates or terminates the taxable end-to-end communications. Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of inter-company facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end-to-end telecommunications service shall be non-taxable as sales for resale. Prepaid telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications" subject to the tax imposed under this article. For purposes of this section, "prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in section 2-27 of the Retailers' Occupations Tax Act. 
(Ord. No. 05-O-71, § 3, 9-13-05) 
Sec. 13-362. - Simplified municipal telecommunications tax imposed. 
    A tax is hereby imposed upon any and all the following acts or privileges:

(2)  The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving in the municipality interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six (6) percent of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail from a retailer.

(3)  The tax imposed by this article is not imposed on such act or privilege to the extent such act or privilege may not, under the Constitution and statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the municipality.

Sec. 13-363. - Collection of tax by retailers. 
(a)  The tax authorized by this article shall be collected from the taxpayer by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and shall be remitted by such retailer to the department. Any tax required to be collected pursuant to or as authorized by this article and any such tax collected by such retailer and required to be remitted to the department shall constitute a debt owned by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this article shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the department in the manner provided by the department. 
(b)  Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this article shall, when collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross charge for telecommunications.

(Ord. No. 05-O-71, § 3, 9-13-05) 
Sec. 13-365. - Resellers. 
(a)  If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will show the department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by this article on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional information as the department may reasonably require. 
(b)  Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation, or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax-free when such actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the person's having discontinued the making of resales. 
(c)  Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active resale number from the department and furnishes that number to the retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is non-taxable because of being a sale for resale. 
(Ord. No. 05-O-71, § 3, 9-13-05)

ARTICLE XVI. - SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES 

Sec. 13-423. - Purpose and findings. 
(a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the village, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within the village. The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. 
(b)  Findings. Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on the community presented in hearings and in reports made available to the board, and on findings incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215 (1990); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 120 S. Ct. 1382 (2000), and on studies in other communities including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona; Minneapolis, Minnesota; St. Paul, Minnesota; Houston, Texas; Indianapolis, Indiana; Amarillo, Texas; Garden Grove, California; Los Angeles, California; Whittier, California; Austin, Texas; Seattle, Washington; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Cleveland, Ohio; Beaumont, Texas; Dallas, Texas; Newport News, Virginia; Bellevue, Washington; New York, New York; Palm County, Florida; and St. Croix County, Wisconsin; and also on findings from the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses, (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the board finds: 
(1)  Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism to make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. 
(2)  Certain employees of sexually oriented businesses defined in this ordinance as adult theatres and cabarets engage in higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than employees of other establishments. 
(3)  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, or live sex shows. 
(4)  Offering and providing such space encourages such activities, which creates unhealthy conditions. 
(5)  Persons frequent certain adult theatres, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses. 
(6)  At least fifty (50) communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non-A, Non-B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections. 
(7)  Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States - six hundred (600) in 1982, two thousand two hundred (2,200) in 1983, four thousand six hundred (4,600) in 1984, eight thousand five hundred fifty-five (8,555) in 1985 and two hundred fifty-three thousand four hundred forty-eight (253,448) through December 31, 1992. 
(8)  As of November of 2001, there have been twenty-six thousand one hundred twenty-seven (26,127) reported cases of AIDS in the State of Illinois. 
(9)  Since 1981 and to the present, there have been an increasing cumulative number of persons testing positive for the HIV antibody test. 
(10)  The number of cases of early (less than one (1) year) syphilis in the United States reported annually has risen, with thirty-three thousand six hundred thirteen (33,613) cases reported in 1982 and forty-five thousand two hundred (45,200) through November of 1990. 
(11)  The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains at a high level, with over one-half million (500,000) cases being reported in 1990. 
(12)  The Surgeon General of the United States in his report of October 22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn. 
(13)  According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. 
(14)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. 
(15)  Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses where persons view "adult" oriented films. 
(16)  The findings noted in paragraphs number (1) through (15) raise substantial governmental concerns. 
(17)  Sexually oriented businesses have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
(18)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the sexually oriented business is run in a manner consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees, as well as the citizens of the village. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the sexually oriented business, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
(19)  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theatres. 
(20)  Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments. 
(21)  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. 
(22)  It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who may engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity. 
(23)  The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this article. 
(24)  The barring of such individuals from the management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. 
(25)  The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the village will be promoted by the enactment of this article.

(g)  Alternate placements. Except as provided in this collocation requirements and conditions section, a wireless provider shall not be required to collocation small wireless facilities on any specific utility pole, or category of utility poles, or be required to collocate multiple antenna systems on a single utility pole. However, with respect to an application for the collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole, the village may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within one hundred (100) feet of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant. 
If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the village, the applicant shall provide written certification describing the property rights, technical limits or material cost reasons the alternate location does not satisfy the criteria in this paragraph. 
(h)  Height limitations. The maximum height of a small wireless facility shall be no more than ten (10) feet above the utility pole or wireless support structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated. 
New or replacement utility poles or wireless support structures on which small wireless facilities are collocated may not exceed the higher of: 
(1)  Ten (10) feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole, other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place on the date the application is submitted to the village, that is located within three hundred (300) feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the village, provided the village may designate which intersecting right-of-way within three hundred (300) feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height limitation for such facility; or 
(2)  Forty-five (45) feet above ground level. 
(i)  Height exceptions or variances. If an applicant proposes a height for a new or replacement pole in excess of the above height limitations on which the small wireless facility is proposed for collocation, the applicant shall apply for a variation from such height limitation. Such application for variations shall be made and processed in accordance with the processes and standards for variations by the board of trustees, as set forth in section 16-8 of the Libertyville Zoning Code. 
(j)  Contractual design requirements. The wireless provider shall comply with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the village and a private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way. 
(k)  Ground-mounted equipment spacing. The wireless provider shall comply with applicable spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses wireless provider requests for exception or variance and do not prohibit granting of such exceptions or variances. 
(l)  Undergrounding regulations. The wireless provider shall comply with local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements that prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility poles in a right-of-way without prior approval if the requirements include a waiver, zoning or other process that addresses requests to install such new utility poles or modify such existing utility poles and do not prohibit the replacement of utility poles. 
(m)  Collocation completion deadline. Collocation for which a permit is granted shall be completed within one hundred eighty (180) days after issuance of the permit, unless the village and the wireless provider agree to extend this period or a delay is caused by make-ready work for a municipal utility pole or by the lack of commercial power or backhaul availability at the site, provided the wireless provider has made a timely request within sixty (60) days after the issuance of the permit for commercial power or backhaul services, and the additional time to complete installation does not exceed three hundred sixty (360) days after issuance of the permit. Otherwise, the permit shall be void unless the village grants an extension in writing to the applicant.

ARTICLE III. - COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 20-44. - Findings. 
    It is hereby found and declared that the regulation of the collection of municipal waste, recyclables and landscape waste bears a reasonable relationship to the village's goal of protecting the health safety and welfare of the residents of the village and that the designation of a single residential waste collector will further this goal as it allows for more efficient handling of such items because obedience to the rules laid down for their handling is more easily compelled and enforced, and because, proper control can only be served by close and careful inspection, which becomes more and more difficult as the number of places and persons to be watched increase. 
(Ord. No. 06-O-28, § 2, 3-14-06) 
Sec. 20-45. - Designation of residential collection contractor.

Sec. 20-46. - Exclusivity; exemption.

Notwithstanding any exclusive contract that the village may enter into for the collection of solid waste and/or recyclable materials from non-residential premises within the village, a non-residential customer may petition the village board to be released from the services of any such exclusive hauling contractor, and the village board may grant such petition provided that the customer establishes to the reasonable satisfaction of the village board that either: 
(1)  The customer is a party to a national contract that cannot be terminated during the period of the exemption; or 
(2)  The customer has unique service requirements that the exclusive hauling contractor cannot provide.

The plat officer shall render the requested interpretation within thirty (30) days after the receipt of a properly completed application therefor. The failure of the plat officer to act within the time period specified in this section, or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a decision of the plat officer denying the application.

The decision of the board of trustees shall be final. The failure of the board of trustees to act within the time periods specified in this section, or within such further time or times to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a decision of the board of trustees denying the appeal in its entirety.

(Ord. No. 96-0-14, § 2(22-213), 3-14-96) 
Sec. 22-40. - Limitations on successive applications. 
    Whenever any application brought pursuant to the Libertyville Subdivision Code has been finally denied, a second application, pertaining to the same property, seeking an approval within one year following a denial of a similar request for approval shall not be brought unless, in the opinion of the plat officer, board of trustees or commission before which the application was brought, the second application contains modifications which render it materially different from the first application or there is substantial new evidence available or a mistake of law or fact which significantly affected the prior denial. 
(a)  Any new grounds to be stated. Any such second application shall include a detailed statement of the grounds justifying consideration of such application. 
(b)  Summary denial with or without hearing. Any such second application may be denied by the plat officer summarily, and without hearing, on a finding by the plat officer that no grounds appear that would warrant further processing of the application. In any case where the plat officer does not summarily deny the application, the application shall be referred to the board of trustees or the plan commission, as required by the Code, and the applicant shall be required to establish grounds warranting further consideration of the merits of its application prior to being allowed to proceed further with said second application. Unless such grounds are established, the second application may be summarily dismissed for such failure. 
(c)  Exceptions. Whether or not grounds are stated, any such second application filed more than one year after the final denial of a prior application shall be processed as though no prior application had been filed. The application shall, however, be required to place in the record all evidence available concerning changes of condition or new facts that have developed since the denial of the first application. In the absence of such evidence, it shall be presumed that no new facts exist to support the new application that did not exist at the time of the denial of the first application.

ARTICLE IV. - DEVELOPMENT AND SUBDIVISION REVIEW PROCESS 

Sec. 22-71. - Plat officer review of developments and consolidation plats. 
    The plat officer shall review every application for approval of a development or a plat of consolidation. 
(1)  Development review; action. The plat officer shall review an application for approval of a development for compliance with all requirements of law and to determine whether subdivision approvals, public improvements, or land dedications are required for such development. The plat officer, within forty-five (45) days after receipt of all required information and payment of all required fees, shall approve the application, shall approve the application with written conditions, shall disapprove the application in writing stating the reasons for such disapproval, or shall refer the application to the board of trustees for review as provided in subsection (6) of this section. The failure of the plat officer to act within the time period specified in this subsection, or such further time to which the developer may agree, shall be deemed to be a decision of the plat officer denying the development application. 
(2)  Effect of development approval. Approval of the plat officer of a development shall not entitle the developer to any other approval or issuance of any permit until after all of the standards and procedures for such other approval or issuance of such permit have been satisfied. 
(3)  Engineering plans and development agreement for certain developments. 
a.  Except as specifically provided otherwise by the board of trustees, no development for which public improvements are required shall be approved by the plat officer until after the final engineering plans for the development have been approved in accordance with the provisions of sections 22-103 and 22-104 of this chapter. 
b.  Except as specifically provided otherwise by the board of trustees, no development for which public improvements are required shall be approved by the plat officer until after the developer has entered into a development agreement with the village in accordance with the provisions of section 22-604 of this chapter. 
(4)  Consolidation plat review; action. The plat officer shall review an application for approval of a plat of consolidation for compliance with all requirements of law. The plat officer, within forty-five (45) days after receipt of all required information and payment of all required fees, shall approve the application, shall disapprove the application in writing stating the reasons for such disapproval, or shall refer the application to the board of trustees for review as provided in subsection (6) of this section. The failure of the plat officer to act within the time period specified in this subsection, or such further time to which the developer may agree, shall be deemed to be a decision of the plat officer denying the application for consolidation plat approval. Every written disapproval by the plat officer of a consolidation plat shall include a statement of the reason or reasons for the disapproval and the changes required to the plat, or additional information or other matters required, before the plat may be approved. Upon approval of the consolidation plat, the plat officer shall cause the appropriate signatures of village officials to be affixed to such plat. 
(5)  Effect of consolidation plat approval. Approval of the plat officer of a plat of consolidation shall not entitle the developer to any other approval or issuance of any permit until after all of the standards and procedures for such other approval or issuance of such permit have been satisfied. 
(6)  Referral to board of trustees by plat officer. The plat officer may, in the exercise of his or her sole discretion, refer any application for approval of a development or of a plat of consolidation to the board of trustees for review, if the plat officer determines that such application involves matters or raises issues appropriate for board of trustees analysis. Any application so referred to the board of trustees shall be reviewed by the board of trustees in the same manner as final plats of subdivisions provided in subsection 22-74(c) of this chapter; provided, however, that the board of trustees, in the exercise of its sole discretion, may refer any such application to the plan commission for its review and recommendation.

(b)  The cash deposit shall, at all times until released or reduced as provided by this section, be maintained at not less than ten (10) percent of the total deposit required by this section. 
(c)  At any time after satisfactory completion of fifty (50) percent of the public improvements, as determined by the village engineer, the board of trustees may reduce the amount of the required cash deposit in its sole and absolute discretion. 
(d)  The cash deposit and the performance and payment letter of credit shall be maintained and renewed by the developer, and shall be held in escrow by the village, until approval and, where appropriate, acceptance of the public improvements by the village and the posting of all guaranty letters of credit required by section 22-129 of this chapter. After such acceptance and posting, the village shall release the performance and payment letter of credit and any amounts remaining in the cash deposit. 
(Ord. No. 96-0-14, § 2(22-702), 3-14-96) 
Sec. 22-129. - Guaranty letter of credit. 
(a)  As a condition of the village's approval and, where appropriate, acceptance of any of the public improvements, the developer shall post a new letter of credit in the amount of five (5) percent of the actual total cost of such improvements as security for the satisfactory correction, repair or replacement of any defect or deficiency in such improvements as required by section 22-126 of this chapter (the "guaranty letter of credit"). The guaranty letter of credit shall be held by the village in escrow until the end of the applicable guaranty period or until two (2) years after the proper correction, repair or replacement of any defect or deficiency in the public improvements and payment therefor, whichever occurs later. 
(b)  If the village is required to draw on the guaranty letter of credit by reason of the developer's failure to fulfill its obligations, then the developer shall within ten (10) days thereafter cause the guaranty letter of credit to be increased to its full original amount. 
(Ord. No. 96-0-14, § 2(22-703), 3-14-96)

(Ord. No. 96-0-14, § 2(22-704), 3-14-96) 
Sec. 22-131. - Form of letters of credit. 
(a)  The performance and payment letter of credit and the guaranty letter of credit shall each be in a form satisfactory to the village attorney. Every letter of credit shall be from a bank acceptable to the village, which bank shall have an office in the Chicago Metropolitan Area and shall be insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. For every letter of credit in excess of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00), such bank shall have capital resources of at least fifty million dollars ($50,000,000.00). Each letter of credit shall, at a minimum, provide that (i) it shall expire no earlier than the later of one (1) year after the date of its issuance or forty-five (45) days after delivery to the village of written notice that such letter of credit will expire; (ii) it may be drawn on based on the village administrator's certification that the developer has failed to fulfill any of the obligations for which the letter of credit is security; (iii) it shall not require the consent of the developer prior to any draw on it by the village; (iv) it shall not be cancelled without the prior written consent of the village; and (v) if at any time it will expire within forty-five (45) or any lesser number of days, and if it has not been renewed, and if any obligation of the developer for which it is security remains incomplete or unsatisfactory, then the village may, without notice and without being required to take any further action of any nature whatsoever, call and draw down the letter of credit and thereafter either hold all proceeds as security for the satisfactory completion of all such obligations or employ the proceeds to complete all such obligations and reimburse the village for any and all costs and expenses, including legal fees and administrative costs, incurred by the village, as the village shall determine. 
(b)  The performance and payment letter of credit may provide that the aggregate amount of the letter of credit may be reduced, but only upon joint written direction by the developer and the village, to reflect a reduction in the total amount of the deposit required pursuant to section 22-128 of this chapter as a result of payments made by the developer in full or partial satisfaction of the developer's obligations to pay village fees, costs and expenses, to complete the required public improvements, to reflect a reduction in the total amount of the deposit required pursuant to section 22-128 of this chapter of this section from one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the approved cost estimate to one hundred ten (110) percent of the amount of an executed contract, or to reimburse the developer for payment of public improvement work satisfactorily completed. No such reduction to reimburse the developer for payment of public improvement work satisfactorily completed shall be allowed except after presentation by the developer of proper contractors' sworn statements, partial or final waivers of lien, as may be appropriate, and all such additional documentation as the village may reasonably request to demonstrate satisfactory completion of the public improvement in question and full payment of all contractors, subcontractors and material suppliers. 
(c)  The guaranty letter of credit shall not be reduced by reason of any cost incurred by the developer to satisfy its obligations to correct, repair or replace defects or deficiencies in the public improvements. 
(Ord. No. 96-0-14, § 2(22-705), 3-14-96) 
Sec. 22-132. - Replenishment of cash deposit and letters of credit. 
    If at any time the village determines that the funds remaining in a cash deposit and a performance and payment letter of credit are not, or may not be, sufficient to pay in full the remaining unpaid cost of all required public improvements and all unpaid or reasonably anticipated village fees, costs and expenses, or that the funds remaining in a guaranty letter of credit are not, or may not be, sufficient to pay all unpaid costs of correcting any and all defects and deficiencies in the required public improvements and all unpaid or reasonably anticipated village fees, costs and expenses, then the village may require that the developer increase the amount of that cash deposit or the appropriate letter of credit to an amount determined by the village to be sufficient to pay such unpaid fees, costs and expenses. 
(Ord. No. 96-0-14, § 2(22-706), 3-14-96) 
Sec. 22-133. - Replacement of letters of credit. 
    If at any time the village determines that the bank issuing a performance and payment letter of credit or a guaranty letter of credit is unable to meet any federal or state requirement for reserves, or is insolvent, or is, for any letter of credit in excess of one million dollars ($1,000,000.00), without capital resources of at least fifty million dollars ($50,000,000.00), or is in danger of becoming any of the foregoing, or is otherwise in danger of being unable or unwilling to honor such letter of credit at any time during its term, or if the village otherwise reasonably deems itself to be insecure, then the village may require that the developer provide a replacement letter of credit from a bank satisfactory to the village. 
(Ord. No. 96-0-14, § 2(22-707), 3-14-96) 
Sec. 22-134. - Use of funds. 
    If the developer fails or refuses to properly complete the required public improvements, or fails or refuses to correct, repair, or replace any defect or deficiency in the public improvements, or fails or refuses to restore property, or fails or refuses to pay immediately any amount demanded by and due to be paid to the village, or in any other manner fails or refuses to meet fully any obligation of the developer, then the village may retain all or any part of a cash deposit and may draw on and retain all or any of the funds remaining in a performance and payment letter of credit or a guaranty letter of credit. The village then may take any action it deems reasonable and appropriate to mitigate the effects of such failure or refusal, and to reimburse itself from the proceeds of the cash deposit, the performance and payment letter of credit, and the guaranty letter of credit for all of its costs and expenses, including legal fees and administrative expenses, resulting from or incurred as a result of the developer's failure or refusal to fully meet its obligations. If the funds remaining in the cash deposit, the performance and payment letter of credit, and the guaranty letter of credit are insufficient to repay fully the village for all such costs and expenses, and to maintain a cash reserve equal to the required guaranty letter of credit during the entire time such guaranty letter of credit should have been maintained by the developer, then the village may require the developer to deposit with the village such additional funds as the village determines are necessary to fully repay such costs and expenses and to establish such cash reserve. 
(Ord. No. 96-0-14, § 2(22-708), 3-14-96) 
Sec. 22-135. - Village lien rights. 
    If any money, property or other consideration due from the developer to the village is not either recovered from the performance security deposits required in this article or paid or conveyed to the village by the developer pursuant to the village's demand therefor, then such money, or the village's reasonable estimate of the value of such property or other consideration, together with interest and costs of collection, including legal fees and administrative expenses, shall become a lien upon all portions of the subdivision or development in which the developer retains any legal, equitable or contractual interest, and the village shall have the right to collect such amount or value, with interest and costs, including legal fees and administrative expenses, and the right to enforce such lien in the same manner as in statutory mortgage foreclosure proceedings. Such lien shall be subordinate to any first mortgage placed upon the subdivision or development; provided, however, that such subordination shall apply only to charges that have become due and payable prior to a sale or transfer of the subdivision or development pursuant to a decree of foreclosure or any other proceeding in lieu of foreclosure. Such sale or transfer shall not relieve the subdivision or development from liability for any charges thereafter becoming due, nor from the lien of any subsequent charge.

ARTICLE VIII. - DEDICATION OF PARK LAND AND SCHOOL SITES 

Sec. 22-146. - Required land dedication or payments in lieu thereof. 
(a)  General requirement. As a condition of approval of a final plat of subdivision, a planned development final plan or a other development containing residential units, the developer shall be required to dedicate land for park and recreational purposes and for school sites to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the subdivision or planned development, or to provide a cash contribution in lieu of actual land dedication, or to provide a combination of land and cash contributions, at the option of the village, in accordance with this article. No occupancy permit shall be issued until such conveyance and contribution has been acknowledged and received by the village. The school site land dedication or cash contribution in lieu thereof shall not apply to the development of senior citizen housing, as that term is defined in the Village of Libertyville Zoning Code. In the event that a senior citizen housing facility is converted to a multiple family dwelling facility, as defined by the Village of Libertyville Zoning Code, no occupancy permit shall be issued for such converted facility until the school site land dedication or cash contribution in lieu thereof has been made, in accordance with the formula set forth in this Code. 
(b)  Density formula. The Table Of Estimated Ultimate Population Per Dwelling Unit, included in this article as Figure 8-1, shall be used as provided in this article to calculate the required dedication of land for park and recreational or school site purposes or the cash contribution in lieu thereof, unless a written objection thereto is filed by the developer with the plat officer. If the developer files such an objection, then the developer shall submit a thorough, comprehensive demographic study showing the estimated population to be generated by the subdivision or planned development or other development containing residential dwelling units. The board of trustees shall make a determination as to the density formula which shall be applied to the subdivision or planned development, which decision shall be based on the demographic study submitted by the developer and all other facts and circumstances relevant to the issue. 
(Ord. No. 96-0-14, § 2(22-800), 3-14-96; Ord. No. 02-O-96, § 2, 8-13-02) 
Sec. 22-147. - Criteria for park land dedication. 
(a)  Calculation of land required to be dedicated. The amount of land required for dedication for park and recreational purposes for a particular subdivision, planned development or other development containing residential dwelling units shall be a direct function of the ultimate population density of that proposed subdivision, planned development or other development containing residential dwelling units. The requirement shall be based on a standard of fifteen (15) acres of land per one thousand (1,000) ultimate population, computed in accordance with the Table of Estimated Ultimate Population Per Dwelling Unit, included in this article as Figure 8-1. 
(b)  Location of land to be dedicated. The location of the land to be dedicated for park and recreational purposes for a particular subdivision, planned development or other development containing residential dwelling units shall be determined by the board of trustees after a recommendation of the plan commission. The determination shall be based on the availability of land, the suitability of any particular land for park and recreational purposes or for other subdivision or development, the location of the land relative to population concentrations, and the proximity of the land to other park or recreational lands. 
(c)  Minimum size of dedicated land. The minimum size of any land to be dedicated for park and recreational purposes shall be ten thousand (10,000) square feet, and no dimension shall be less than one hundred (100) feet, except that the plan commission may recommend and the board of trustees may approve dedications of a smaller size or dimension when required by the specific plans of the subdivision, planned development or other development containing residential dwelling units and when the usefulness of the smaller area for park and recreational purposes is clearly demonstrated.

NOTE: There are only three significant categories provided in this chart. Because of the similarity of yields among all types of attached single-family use, just one category is provided for all types of that use. The same is true with apartments, so just one category is provided for all types of apartments. Experience and the development of new types of detached and attached single-family units may require that an individual evaluation be made of a particular application. 
The determination of the number of bedrooms contained in a building shall be made by the plat officer. Rooms designated by a developer as "den," "library," "study," "sewing room," "exercise room," or the like may be designated by the plat officer as bedrooms if they are suitable for such accommodations.

(f)  Private common open space and recreational areas. 
(1)  When private open space is made permanently available for use on an equal and common basis to every resident in the subdivision, planned development or other development containing residential dwelling units at a proportionate share of the cost of maintenance, and such open space is designed to meet the recreational needs of the subdivision, planned development, or other development containing residential dwelling units then a 100 percent credit toward the land dedication requirement of this section shall be allowed to the extent of such open space so provided, and if the total of such open space so provided equals the total acreage required to be dedicated by this section, then the provision of such open space shall fulfill the amount required by this section to be dedicated for park and recreational purposes. 
(2)  If the private open space so provided is not adequately or properly maintained, at any time, to the satisfaction of the board of trustees, or if such open space is not made available for use on an equal and common basis to every resident in the subdivision, planned development or other development containing residential dwelling units at a proportionate share of the cost of maintenance, or ceases to be made so available for use on such basis, then such open space shall be dedicated to the public for public park and recreational purposes at the request for such a dedication made by resolution or ordinance duly adopted by the board of trustees. The developer shall prepare and record covenants establishing these provisions, which covenants shall be duly executed by all owners of the land and all mortgage holders, if any, and delivered to the village for recording. Each such covenant shall recite that it shall be enforceable by suit in equity brought by the village, its successors, if any, or by any interested person.

Sec. 22-148. - Criteria for school site land dedication. 
(a)  Calculation of land required to be dedicated. The amount of land required to be dedicated for school sites for a particular subdivision, planned development or other development containing residential dwelling units shall be a direct function of the ultimate number of students to be generated by the subdivision, planned development or other development containing residential dwelling units. The land dedication requirement shall be determined in accordance with the following equation: 
Number of children to be served in each school classification (computed in accordance with Figure 8-1) divided by 
Maximum number of students to be served in each such school classification (as stated in subsection (b) of this section) × 
Minimum number of acres for each school site for each such school classification (as stated in subsection (b) of this section). 
The result of such calculation shall be the minimum acreage of land necessary for school sites to serve the children in the subdivision or planned development. 
(b)  School classifications; land required. School classifications and the required minimum size of new school sites within the village shall be determined in accordance with the following criteria: 
School 
Classification 
 by Grades Maximum Number Of 
Students For Each 
Such Classification Minimum Number of 
Acres Per Site of 
Such Classification Elementary schools, grades kindergarten through 8th (K-8)   900 Students 16 Acres High schools, grades 9th through 12th (9-12) 2,000 Students 50 Acres  
(c)  Location of land to be dedicated. The location of each school site shall be determined by the board of trustees. The village's official comprehensive plan and the standards adopted by the affected school district shall be used as guidelines in locating school sites. 
(d)  On-site storage prohibited. No materials, including without limitation top soil or other soil materials, shall be stored on any land that has been dedicated, or has been designated for dedication, to the village for a school site. 
(e)  Detention and retention areas not qualified. No stormwater detention or retention area shall qualify as land suitable for dedication for a school site, unless the suitability of such land for such school site as a secondary use is clearly demonstrated to the satisfaction of the board of trustees.

    If a subdivision, planned development or other development containing residential dwelling units is small and the resulting required land dedication is too small, in the determination of the village, to be practical, or when the village finds that the available land is inappropriate for park and recreational purposes or for a school site, then the village shall require the developer to pay a cash contribution in lieu of the required land dedication, in accordance with the standards of this section. 
(1)  Basis of contributions; separate contracts. The cash contributions in lieu of land shall be based on the "fair market value" of the land that otherwise would have been dedicated as park land or for a school site; provided, however, that in each case when a developer has a valid, binding written contract with the school district pertaining to the property that is subject to subdivision, planned development or other development containing residential dwelling units which establishes the amounts of the cash contributions to be made to such school district for the purposes herein contemplated, then such amounts shall govern and be in lieu of the cash contributions required hereby; and provided further, however, that if such contract is terminated for any cause or reason, then the requirements of this article shall apply. 
(2)  Definition of fair market value. The present "fair market value" of land in and surrounding the village is two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00) per acre, and such figure therefore shall be used in making any calculation herein unless a written objection thereto is filed pursuant to subsection (3) of this section. The village administrator shall, periodically but no less frequently than annually, survey surrounding communities, conduct discussions with the Libertyville Township Assessor's office and affected school districts, and report his or her findings to the board of trustees with respect to the adequacy of the village's determination of fair market value as set forth in this section. 
(3)  Objections to defined fair market value. Any affected person may object to the fair market value determination of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00) per acre by filing such objection with the plat officer. The objecting party shall submit an appraisal showing the fair market value of improved land in the area of the subdivision, planned development or other development containing residential dwelling units. Such appraisal shall be made by a member of the Appraisal Institute of the American Institute of Real Estate Appraisers. The final determination of fair market value of such improved land shall be made by the board of trustees based on such information submitted by the objecting party, any response thereto by the developer or other affected person, and other relevant facts. 
(4)  Disposition of cash contributions. 
a.  Cash contributions in lieu of park land dedications shall be held in trust by the village, or other public body designated by the village, solely for the acquisition or development of park and recreational land to serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision, planned development or other development containing residential dwelling units for the improvement of other existing local park and recreational sites. 
b.  Cash contributions in lieu of school site land dedications shall be held in trust by the village, or other public body designated by the village, solely for use in the acquisition of land for a school site to serve the immediate or future needs of students from that subdivision, planned development or other Development containing residential dwelling units or for the improvement to any existing school site which already serves such needs. 
c.  Funds held in trust shall be kept separate from all other funds and shall be accounted for in the appropriate manner. Records shall be readily available for inspection by the public during regular business hours. 
(5)  Refund of cash contributions. If any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of a park land dedication, or a cash contribution in lieu of a school site land dedication, is not expended for the purposes set forth herein within seven (7) years after the date of receipt of such contribution by the village, then that cash contribution shall be refunded to the developer who made such contribution, or its successor or assign. 
(Ord. No. 96-0-14, § 2(22-803), 3-14-96; Ord. No. 97-O-45, § 2, 6-10-97; Ord. No. 02-O-18, § 2, 2-12-02; Ord. No. 02-O-96, § 2, 8-13-02) 
Sec. 22-150. - Criteria for combination land dedication and cash payment. 
    A combination of a land dedication and a cash contribution in lieu of a land dedication shall be required when: 
(1)  Inadequate land. The subdivision, planned development or other development containing residential dwelling units has some but not enough adequate land to meet the dedication requirements of this article. That portion of the land within the subdivision, planned development or other development containing residential dwelling units that is adequate for park land or a school site shall be dedicated as provided in this article, and a cash contribution shall be required for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated pursuant to this article. 
(2)  Previous acquisition. A major part of the local park or recreational site or school site already has been acquired and only a small parcel of land is needed from the subdivision, planned development or other development containing residential dwelling units to complete the site. Such parcel shall be acquired by dedication, and a cash contribution shall be required for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated pursuant to this article. 
(Ord. No. 96-0-14, § 2(22-804), 3-14-96; Ord. No. 02-O-96, § 2, 8-13-02) 
Sec. 22-151. - Reservation of additional land. 
    When the village's official comprehensive plan or other applicable standard of the village requires a larger amount of park and recreational land or a larger school site in a particular subdivision, planned development or other development containing residential dwelling units than the developer is required to dedicate, then the land needed in excess of the required dedication shall be reserved by the developer for subsequent purchase by the village or other public body designated by the village, provided that such acquisition is started within one year after the date of approval of the final plat of subdivision or the planned development final plan or the issuance of a building permit. 
(Ord. No. 96-0-14, § 2(22-805), 3-14-96; Ord. No. 02-O-96, § 2, 8-13-02) 
Sec. 22-152. - Combining with adjoining subdivisions. 
    If a subdivision, planned development or other development containing residential dwelling units is less than forty (40) acres in area, then a park and recreational land dedication or a school site land dedication may be combined with a dedication for the same purposes of land in an abutting subdivision, planned development or other Development containing residential dwelling units to produce a usable park or recreational area or school site. 
(Ord. No. 96-0-14, § 2(22-806), 3-14-96; Ord. No. 02-O-96, § 2, 8-13-02) 
Sec. 22-153. - Topography and grading. 
    The slope, topography and geology of a site to be dedicated pursuant to the requirements of this article VIII, as well as its surroundings, must be suitable for the intended purpose of the site. Grading on every site dedicated for park and recreational uses shall not differ greatly from surrounding land. No removal of existing topsoil shall be permitted. 
(Ord. No. 96-0-14, § 2(22-807), 3-14-96) 
Sec. 22-154. - Improved sites. 
    All sites shall be dedicated in a condition ready for full service of electrical, telecommunications, gas, water, sewer and streets (including curb and gutter and enclosed drainage), as applicable to the location of the site, or acceptable provisions shall be made therefor. Improvements to park and recreational lands shall be coordinated with the village parks department and shall include without limitation site grading, sodding or seeding, paved parking areas, and installation of playground equipment. 
(Ord. No. 96-0-14, § 2(22-808), 3-14-96) 
Sec. 22-155. - Dedication required as part of annexation agreement or special use permit. 
    The dedication of land, or cash contributions in lieu thereof, required by this article VIII also shall be required as a condition of the annexation of any land to the village for residential purposes and to the issuance of any special use permit, but not to an amendment of an annexation agreement or to a special use permit unless the board of trustees finds from a consideration of the purposes of this chapter that such dedications or payments should be required because of increased burdens to be placed on schools and the park system over and above those covered by the dedications and cash contributions made or provided for in connection with the original annexation agreement or special use permit. If the board of trustees does so find, then the additional dedications or cash contributions to be required as a result thereof shall only be to such extent as will cover the shortage resulting by reason of such increased burdens. Dedications of land or cash contributions in lieu thereof as specified in any annexation agreement or special use permit which are in substantial conformance with the requirements of this article VIII shall be deemed to have fulfilled the dedication requirements of this article VIII. 
(Ord. No. 96-0-14, § 2(22-809), 3-14-96) 
Sec. 22-156. - Dedication at time of approval of final plat. 
    Approval of any final plat of subdivision, any planned development final plan and the issuance of a building permit for a other development containing residential dwelling units shall be conditioned on the dedication of land, or cash donations in lieu thereof, as required by this article. When a subdivision or planned development is to be developed over a period of years, dedication of required land may be made after completion of a portion of the subdivision, planned development or other development containing residential dwelling units provided that an escrow fund satisfactory to the village has been established to guarantee the conveyance of land after completion of such portion of the subdivision, planned development or other development containing residential dwelling units. 
(Ord. No. 96-0-14, § 2(22-810), 3-14-96; Ord. No. 02-O-96, § 2, 8-13-02) 
Sec. 22-157. - Credit for farm valuation rollback of taxes. 
    When land being developed that is subject to the dedication or contribution requirements of this article VIII has been classified in such a way that the assessed valuation has resulted in a farm valuation less than it would otherwise be assessed and is subject to a rollback of assessment and/or real estate taxes, the developer may claim a credit in the amount of the additional taxes paid to the schools and the village to be applied against the developer's obligation under the terms this article VIII. Satisfactory evidence of payment shall be provided to the village before any such credit will be granted.

All such work shall be done, insofar as practicable, in such manner as not to obstruct, injure, or prevent the free use and operation of facilities. If any such facilities shall interfere with the construction or repair of any public way or public improvement therein, the grantee shall, at its sole cost and expense, commence and diligently prosecute to completion the relocation, removal, or replacement of such facilities within one hundred twenty (120) days after the delivery of written notice by the village. Such work shall be performed as be reasonably directed by the village. In the event the facilities must be so relocated, the village engineer and the village director of public works shall cooperate with the grantee in identifying alternative rights of way for the relocated facilities.

Sec. 23-6. - Automated traffic law enforcement.

(c)  The automated traffic law enforcement system shall not be used for the purpose of recording the speed of vehicles. 
(d)  For each violation of this section recorded by an automatic traffic law enforcement system, the village or its service provider shall issue a written notice of the violation to the registered owner of the vehicle as the alleged violator. The notice shall be delivered to the registered owner of the vehicle, by mail, within thirty (30) days after the secretary of state notifies the municipality or county of the identity of the owner of the vehicle, but in no event later than ninety (90) days after the violation. The notice shall include: 
(1)  The name and address of the registered owner of the vehicle; 
(2)  The registration number of the motor vehicle involved in the violation, 
(3)  The violation charged; 
(4)  The location where the violation occurred; 
(5)  The date and time of the violation;

(10)  A statement that the person may elect to proceed by paying the fine or by challenging the charge in court, or by mail, or by administrative hearing. 
(e)  If a person, charged with a traffic violation as a result of an automated traffic law enforcement system, does not pay or successfully contests the civil penalty resulting from that violation, the secretary of state shall suspend the driving privileges of the registered owner of the vehicle under Section 6-306.5 of this Illinois Vehicle Code for failing to pay any fine or penalty due and owing as a result of five (5) violations of the automated traffic law enforcement system. 
(f)  Based on inspection of recorded images produced by an automated traffic law enforcement system, a notice alleging that the violation occurred shall be evidence of the facts contained in the notice and admissible in any proceeding alleging a violation under this section. 
(g)  Recorded images made by an automatic traffic law enforcement system are confidential and shall be made available only to the alleged violator and governmental and law enforcement agencies for purposes of adjudicating a violation of this section, for statistical purposes, or for other governmental purposes. Any recorded image evidencing a violation of this section, however, may be admissible in any proceeding resulting from the issuance of the citation. 
(h)  The court or hearing officer may consider in defense of a violation: 
(1)  That the motor vehicle or registration plates of the motor vehicle were stolen before the violation occurred and not under the control of or in the possession of the owner at the time of the violation, 
(2)  That the driver of the vehicle passes through the intersection when the light was red either (i) in order to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle or (ii) was part of a funeral procession; and 
(3)  Any other evidence or issues provided by municipal ordinance. 
(i)  To demonstrate that the motor vehicle or the registration plates were stolen before the violation occurred and were not under the control or possession of the owner at the time of the violation, the owner must submit proof that a report concerning the stolen motor vehicle or registration plates was filed with a law enforcement agency in a timely manner.

A violation for which a civil penalty is imposed under this section is not a violation of a traffic regulation governing the movement of vehicles and may not be recorded on the driving record of the owner of the vehicle. 
(k)  An intersection equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system must be posted with a sign visible to approaching traffic indicating that the intersection is being monitored by an automated traffic law enforcement system.

future trends of the Village with respect to its population, housing, economic,

resources and use and its transportation facilities, public facilities, and utilities;
and any other matter relative to the present and future patterns of life within the

the Plan Commission with the advice and assistance of the Village Administrator
and adopted by the Board of Trustees by ordinance duly enacted, together with
such amendments thereto as may be adopted from time to time. The term
Official Comprehensive Plan also shall refer to any internally consistent and

AND ZONING DISTRICTS
37
3-1.4 Effect. After the adoption of the Official Comprehensive Plan, or a part thereof,
no ordinance, regulation, or Official Map relating to the physical maintenance,
development, or redevelopment of the Village or any land within it, shall be
enacted, established, amended, or varied and no right-of-way, street, utility, or
public structure or land shall be authorized, established, developed, redeveloped,
or modified in location or extent except in accordance with the policies, goals,
objectives, principles, and standards of the Official Comprehensive Plan, or
relevant part thereof, unless the Board of Trustees shall first make a specific
finding that the facts and circumstances affecting the particular matter justify a
departure from the Official Comprehensive Plan.
3-1.5 Procedures.
a. Plan Development. The Plan Commission, with the assistance of the
Village Administrator, shall exercise the powers and duties delegated to it
by Section 15-2 of this Code in the continuing development and revision
of the Official Comprehensive Plan. The process of plan development is
necessarily an informal one not readily adaptable to rigid procedures, but
the Plan Commission and the Village Administrator, in developing a plan,
shall make all reasonable efforts to obtain the views, comments, and
criticisms of interested persons. In addition, the Plan Commission, prior to
making any recommendation for the adoption or amendment of a plan or
part thereof to the Board of Trustees, shall set, notice, and conduct a
public hearing thereon in accordance with the provisions of Section 16-3
of this Code.
The Board of Trustees may, at any time, refer a plan to the Plan
Commission for consideration and recommendation. In the case of such
referral, the Plan Commission shall return its recommendation to the
Board of Trustees not later than ninety (90) days after receipt of the
referral. If such recommendation is not so delivered, then the Board of
Trustees may proceed to consider the amendment without such
recommendation.
When satisfied that a plan or a part thereof is adequate for adoption as, or
as an amendment of, the Official Comprehensive Plan of the Village or a
part thereof, the Plan Commission shall transmit such plan or part thereof
to the Board of Trustees together with its recommendations for adoption
of such plan as well as any reports or statements deemed necessary to a
full consideration of such plan or part thereof. Such reports or statements
may include majority and minority positions. Such transmittal shall be
made not later than fifteen (15) days after the close of the public hearing
concerning such plan.
b. Plan Adoption. After receiving any recommendation of the Plan
Commission with respect to the adoption or amendment of any plan or a
ARTICLE 3 - PLANS, MAPS, LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE
AND ZONING DISTRICTS
38
part thereof, the Board of Trustees, by ordinance duly enacted, may adopt
such plan in whole or in part, with or without amendments; or may refer
such plan or any part thereof back to the Plan Commission for further
consideration; or may reject such plan. The Board of Trustees shall take
such action not later than ninety (90) days after the close of the Plan
Commission public hearing on such plan. The failure of the Board of
Trustees to act within such period shall be deemed to be a rejection of the
plan. Upon the adoption of any such plan or part thereof, it shall be
designated as the Official Comprehensive Plan of the Village of
Libertyville and, if less than a total comprehensive plan, shall carry a
subheading designating its specific contents.
c. Plan Amendment. The Official Comprehensive Plan, or any part thereof,
may be amended at any time in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 3-1.5.c. Such an amendment may be initiated by the Board of
Trustees, the Plan Commission, the Village Administrator, or by any
owner of property affected by the provisions of such plan sought to be
amended. Amendments initiated by the Board of Trustees, the Plan
Commission, or the Village Administrator shall require no formal
application and shall be processed as provided in this Section 3-1.5.
Amendments initiated by the owner of affected property shall be initiated
by an application filed pursuant to Section 16-1, except that the time limits
specified in this Section 3-1.5 shall apply.
d. Plan Filing and Notice of Adoption. The ordinance adopting the Official
Comprehensive Plan, or any part thereof, shall provide that the Village
Administrator shall cause a certified copy thereof to be placed on file in
the Office of the Village Clerk and shall cause a notice evidencing the
adoption of such plan, or part thereof, to be filed with the Lake County
Recorder of Deeds.
3-2 Official Map
3-2.1 Authority. The Plan Commission shall have authority to prepare and to
recommend to the Board of Trustees an Official Map of the Village and the
unincorporated areas surrounding the Village and from time to time to prepare
and recommend amendments thereto, all of which the Board of Trustees may
adopt as the Official Map of the Village of Libertyville.
3-2.2 Definition. The Official Map shall be defined as a compilation of maps,
standards, and specifications of and for existing and proposed rights-of-way,
streets, alleys, utility easements, public grounds, and public utility systems within
the Village or within the unincorporated area lying within one and one-half miles

LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE ARTICLE 3 - PLANS, MAPS,
AND ZONING DISTRICTS

together with such amendments thereto as may be adopted from time to time. The
term Official Map also shall refer to any internally consistent and complete
portion of such a compilation relating to any one or more of the aforesaid subjects
or to any specific portion of the aforesaid geographical area.
The Official Map referred to in this section is the map authorized by Sections 11-

seq.
3-2.3 Purpose. The Official Map is adopted to implement the Official Comprehensive
Plan, to assure the adequacy of the public facilities to which it relates, and to
secure for the Village the authority and benefits provided by state law in
connection with such an Official Map.
3-2.4 Effect. The Official Map shall have the effect accorded to it by Section 11-12-8
et seq. of the Illinois Municipal Code, as amended, 65 ILCS 5/11-12-8 et seq., and
also shall have the effect accorded to the Official Comprehensive Plan by Section
3-1.4 of this Code.

filing of the Official Map shall be the same as those provided in Section 3-1.5,
with respect to the Official Comprehensive Plan.

I-1 Limited Industrial District
I-2 East Downtown Transitional District
I-3 General Industrial District
Special Districts (Article 8)
OS Open Space District
IB Institutional Buildings District
3-4 Interpretation of District Sequence
3-4.1 General Rule. This Code rejects as outdated and inappropriate the concept of
hierarchical and cumulative Zoning Districts and, except as noted below, is based
on the concept that each district should be designed to accomplish a specific
purpose, to encourage a particular type of development, and to protect that
development from being encroached upon by incompatible types of development.
3-4.2 Special Rule. Within the foregoing philosophy, however, it is recognized that,
when different districts are juxtaposed, their differing characters may require
special treatment to ameliorate incompatibilities that might otherwise result. For
this limited purpose, this Code recognizes the concept of more restrictive and
less restrictive districts, and the districts established by this Code shall be
considered more restrictive or less restrictive in accordance with the
following rules:
a. The Open Space Districts shall be deemed to be more restrictive than any
other district.
b. The Residential Districts shall be deemed to be more restrictive than any
nonresidential district, except the Open Space District.
c. The R-1 District shall be deemed to be the most restrictive Residential
District and the R-8 District shall be deemed to be the least restrictive
Residential District, and the Residential Districts shall be deemed to
become less restrictive as the district number increases.
d. The Commercial, Office, Industrial and Institutional Buildings Districts
shall be deemed to be equally restrictive.

3-5.2 Application for Different Classification. When any land is classified pursuant
to this Section 3-5, it shall remain so classified unless and until an application to

intended boundaries of the various districts as shown on the Zoning Map, the
following rules shall apply:
a. The district boundaries are the centerlines of highways, streets, alleys,
waterways, railroads, and other rights-of-way unless otherwise indicated.
When the designation of a boundary line on the Zoning Map coincides
with the location of any such right-of-way, the centerline of such right-ofway
shall be construed to be the boundary of such district.
b. When a district boundary does not coincide with the location of the
centerline of any right-of-way but does coincide with a lot line, such lot
line shall be construed to be the boundary of such district.
ARTICLE 3 - PLANS, MAPS, LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE

c. When a district boundary does not coincide with the location of the
centerline of any right-of-way or a lot line, the district boundary shall be

189
fractional space, any fraction shall require one additional parking

4) Bench Seating. In places of assembly in which patrons or
spectators occupy benches or other similar seating facilities, each
twenty-two (22) inches of such seating facility shall be counted as
one seat for the purpose of determining the requirement for offstreet
parking facilities under this Code.
f. Payment In Lieu of Required Parking Spaces. The Owner of property
within the C-1 Downtown Core Commercial District may apply for a
permit for Payment in Lieu of Required Parking Spaces in connection with
such property, provided that each of the following apply:

floor area to an existing building.
2) The minimum number of required parking spaces for the use
proposed by the Owner for such property are not available to the
Owner and cannot be acquired by the Owner.
The required payment for each parking space for which such a permit is
sought shall be in the amount set forth in the Annual Fee Ordinance
required by Section 1-19 of the Village of Libertyville Municipal Code.
No such permit shall be issued except upon payment by the Owner of the
required fee and the issuance of a special use permit pursuant to Section
5-2.3.f of this Code.

capable of withstanding the extremes of individual site microclimates.
All specifications for measurement, quality, and installation of trees
and shrubs shall be in accordance with the American Standards for
Nursery Stock published by the American Association of Nurserymen.
d. Substitution. When unique natural features such as topography, soil,
geological characteristics, water features and existing vegetation; or
space limitations such as an unusually shaped lot; or the location of
existing structures and other built features make it impractical to
comply with the requirements of this Section 13-2.2, the Board of
Trustees may approve in writing, substitutions to the quantity, size and
distribution of required plant materials, but only if it is determined
that:
1) There is no reduction in the quality of plant materials;
2) There is no significant change in size or location of plant
materials; and
3) The plant materials proposed for substitution have similar
general design characteristics (mature height, crown spread) as
the materials being replaced.
e. Credit for Tree Preservation. Preservation of existing healthy trees
and natural landscape features on a site is encouraged. The number of
new plant materials, as specified in Section 13-2.2.a., may be reduced
when existing trees of a desirable species in a healthy and growing
condition are preserved within the area of the perimeter landscaped
open space. Credit for the preservation of existing trees six (6) inches
in caliper or greater (deciduous) or six (6) feet in height or greater
(evergreen), shall be as follows, but in no instance shall a developer or

1 shade or single stem ornamental tree, 6" to 12" caliper or
1 evergreen tree or multiple stem ornamental, 6' to 12' in height 3 trees
1 shade or single stem ornamental tree, more than 12" but
less than 30" caliber or 1 evergreen tree or multiple stem
ornamental tree, more than 12' 4 trees
1 shade or single stem ornamental tree, 30" or greater 5 trees
13-2.3 Design. The scale and nature of landscape material should be appropriate to
the site and structures. Larger scaled buildings, for example, should be
complimented by larger scaled plants. Plant material should be selected for its
form, texture, color and concern for its ultimate growth. Perimeter landscaped
open space shall be broken only by required access drives and sidewalks.
Every perimeter landscaped open space shall be so designed and maintained
as to preserve unobstructed vision of the street and sidewalk at points of
access and as not to interfere with, or be damaged by, work within any public
or utility easement unless the Village Administrator shall determine that no
other location is reasonably feasible.
13-3 PARKING LOTS AND STRUCTURES
13-3.1 Parking Lot Screening. In addition to the requirements of Section 13-2 of
this Code for perimeter landscaped open space, every parking lot shall, to the
extent hereinafter specified, be buffered and screened with appropriate
screening devices such as decorative walls, fences, or berms. The landscaping
and screening treatment shall be designed and maintained to a height of at
least six (6) feet along every lot line abutting a Residential District and to a
height of at least three (3) feet along every other lot line (See Figure 13-2).
For parking lot screening installed along lot lines abutting a Residential
District, the landscaping and screening treatment shall have a minimum height
of three (3) feet at time of planting. The height of screening shall be measured
from the surface of the parking lot. For parking lots developed prior to the
effective date of this Code, the required level of compliance with the
standards of this Section 13-3.1 shall be determined upon the review and
evaluation of the Village Administrator in light of the condition of the lot on
that date as it relates to the feasibility of meeting such standards without
undue disruption of existing conditions.

islands. However, at no time shall a shade tree be planted closer than
twenty (20) feet to any other shade tree. The remaining area of such
islands shall consist of groundcover or decorative paving material.
d. Dispersal. When more than one (1) tree planting island is provided
pursuant to this Section 13-3.2, such islands shall be spaced
throughout the parking lot.
13-3.3 Parking Structure Design and Screening. Every parking structure
constructed after the effective date of this Code shall comply with the
following design standards:
a. The exterior walls of the structure shall be designed and constructed so
as to shield all parked vehicles from view from any adjacent property
or street; and
b. Every parking structure shall be designed and constructed so that the
exterior facing of the structure is architecturally compatible with the

other architectural elements of adjacent buildings. Exterior walls of
accessory parking structures shall be finished with a material having a
common architectural character with the principal building.
d. In addition to the requirements of Section 13-2 of this Code for
perimeter landscaped open space, every parking structure located that
abuts any Single Family Residential District or a Single Family
Attached Residential District , shall be screened along the entire length
of each side of such parking structure that abuts such district by shade
or ornamental trees and evergreen trees with a minimum height of ten
(10) feet at the time of planting.
13-4 LOADING SPACES
Every loading space visible from any lot zoned for a residential use, whether or not such
residential use is within the Village, shall be screened on all sides visible from any such
lot by an opaque fence, wall, landscaped berm or densely planted evergreen hedge of not
less than six (6) feet in height, except as necessary for access.
13-5 REFUSE CONTAINERS; OUTDOOR STORAGE
13-5.1 Screening. All refuse containers and all areas of permitted outdoor storage
shall be fully enclosed by an opaque fence, wall, or densely planted evergreen
hedge of a height sufficient to completely screen such containers or storage
areas from view from all adjoining properties and all streets.
13-5.2 Location. No refuse containers shall be located between any principal
structure and either its front or corner side lot line. When the district
regulations allow outdoor storage areas, such outdoor storage areas shall
comply with the use regulations for the district in which they are located.
13-5.3 Exemptions. Sections 13-5.1 and 13-5.2 of this Code shall not apply to
standard receptacles permitted for use by single family dwellings and to
receptacles placed and maintained for use by the general public to avoid
littering.
13-6 RESIDENTIAL RECREATIONAL FACILITIES AND SWIMMING POOLS
Except as provided herein, outdoor residential recreational facilities and swimming pools
accessory to any dwelling located in any Residential District shall be buffered and
screened by a solid fence or a densely planted evergreen hedge of not less than six (6)
feet in height in combination along with any other landscaping materials as may be
LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE ARTICLE 13 - LANDSCAPING, SCREENING,
AND FENCES
279
needed. Such screening shall be provided on all sides of such facility or swimming pool
which are visible from any property or street which is adjacent to the zoning lot on which
such residential recreational facility or swimming pool is located. If the owner of a
residential recreational device or swimming pool desires to obtain a waiver from this
screening requirement, the owner shall identify the side or sides of the residential
recreational device or swimming pool for which the owner is seeking a waiver from the
screening requirements and must obtain consent to such waiver by written agreement
from the owners of all adjacent residentially zoned lots that are both within the Village
and within one hundred (100) feet of the lot on which the recreational facility or
swimming pool is located. Upon receipt of an agreement executed by all such adjacent
property owners, the portion of the screening for which a waiver is being sought shall not
be required. The waiver shall remain in effect during such time as the adjacent property
owners continue to hold the legal or beneficial interest in the title to such adjacent
properties. The written agreement shall provide that upon written demand of any of the
adjacent property owners or upon the sale or transfer of the legal or beneficial interest in
any of the adjacent properties, all otherwise required screening shall be installed, in
compliance with this section, within ninety (90) days of either such written demand or the
sale or transfer of the legal or beneficial interest in any of the adjacent properties. Failure
to install the required screening within such ninety (90) day period shall be deemed a
violation of this Code. In the event that the new owner of the legal or beneficial interest
of an adjacent property executes the agreement required by this section, the waiver with
respect to screening shall remain in force. The written agreement shall be recorded with
the Lake County Recorder of Deeds against the property upon which the residential
recreational facility or swimming pool is located and each of the adjacent properties.

antenna support structures as are permitted pursuant to Section 12-12.3, shall be buffered
and screened by a fence and a densely planted evergreen hedge of not less than six (6)
feet in height, in combination with any other landscaping materials as may be needed.
Such screening shall be provided between any such ground-mounted antenna or antenna
support structure and each lot line of the property on which such antenna or antenna
support structure is located so as to provide the maximum reasonably achievable
screening, as determined by the Village Administrator, of such antenna and antenna
support structure from view from adjacent properties and streets.

13-8.1 Roof Top Mechanical Equipment. Except as otherwise provided below
with respect to vent stacks, all roof top mechanical equipment shall be
screened to the full height of such equipment by a parapet wall or other
screening structure constructed of the same or compatible materials as the
principal building facade. To the extent that an existing building contains roof
top mechanical equipment which is not screened and which is permitted to
continue pursuant to Article 14 of this Code, any replacement rooftop
mechanical equipment may be installed without screening, provided, however,
that such replacement rooftop mechanical equipment shall be the same color
as the principal building facade. Vent stacks located on sloped roofs need not
be screened. Vent stacks located on flat roofs and exceeding three (3) feet in
height and having a diameter of twelve (12) inches or more shall be screened
to a minimum height of three (3) feet. The required level of compliance with
the standards set forth in this Section 13-8.1 for screening of all other vent
stacks located on a flat roof shall be determined by review and evaluation of
the Village Administrator, which review and evaluation shall take into
account the condition of the subject lot, the setbacks and yards existing on the
subject lot, the feasibility of compliance with such standards, the impact of
such compliance on the ability to develop the use on the subject lot in a
manner consistent with the intent and the purposes of this Code, the impact on
surrounding uses and lots of compliance or noncompliance with such
standards, and any other factor determined by the Village Administrator to be
relevant, appropriate, and consistent with the intent and purposes of this Code.
All vent stacks and all appurtenances thereto shall be painted or otherwise
disguised to blend in with the principal building facade.
13-8.2 Ground Mounted Mechanical Equipment. All ground mounted mechanical
equipment shall be screened by an opaque fence, wall, or densely planted
landscaping material of a height sufficient to completely screen such
equipment from view from all adjoining properties and all streets; provided,
however, that ground mounted mechanical equipment in Residential Districts
need not be screened except when otherwise expressly required by this Code.

LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE ARTICLE 14 - NONCONFORMITIES
285
ARTICLE 14 - NONCONFORMITIES
14-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS
14-1.1 Purposes. This Article 14 regulates and limits the continued existence of
uses, structures, lots, signs, and fences established prior to the effective date of
this Code that do not conform to the regulations of this Code applicable in the
Zoning Districts in which such uses, structures, lots, signs, and fences are
located.
The Zoning Districts established by this Code are designed to guide the future
use of land within the Village by encouraging the development or
maintenance of desirable residential, commercial, office, institutional open
space and recreational, and industrial areas with appropriate groupings of
compatible and related uses and thus to promote and protect the public health,
safety, and general welfare. The continued existence of nonconformities is
frequently inconsistent with the purposes for which such districts are
established and thus the gradual elimination of such nonconformities is
generally desirable.
14-1.2 General Scope and Scheme of Regulation. This Article 14 establishes
separate restrictions for the following categories of nonconformities:
a. Nonconforming uses.
b. Nonconforming structures.
c. Nonconforming lots of record.
d. Nonconforming signs.
e. Nonconforming fences.
The degree of restriction made applicable to each category of nonconformity
is generally related to the degree of incompatibility with permitted or specially
permitted principal or accessory uses and the amount of investment typically
associated with nonconformities of that type. Pursuant to Section 16-8 of this
Code, provision is made for relief from some of the restrictions of this Article
14 when a practical difficulty or a particular hardship exists.
While the regulations of this Article 14 related to nonconformities allow such
nonconformities to continue without specific limitation of time, the
regulations restrict further investments that would make the nonconformity
more permanent, and the eventual elimination of the nonconformity is
intended.
ARTICLE 14 - NONCONFORMITIES LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE
286
14-1.3 Nonconforming Accessory Uses and Structures. No use, structure, sign, or
fence that is accessory to a principal nonconforming use or structure shall
continue after such principle use or structure shall have been terminated,
unless it shall thereafter conform to all the regulations of the Zoning District
in which it is located.
14-1.4 Burden of Owner to Establish Legality of Nonconformity. The burden of
establishing that any nonconformity is lawfully existing under the provisions
of this Article 14 shall, in all cases, be upon the owner of the nonconforming
property and not upon the Village.
14-2 NONCONFORMING USES
14-2.1 Authority to Continue. Except as provided in Section 14-2.9, any
nonconforming use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful,
subject to the regulations contained in this Section 14-2 and in Sections 14-1.3
and 14-1.4 of this Code.
14-2.2 Ordinary Repair and Maintenance. Normal maintenance and incidental
repair, and installation or relocation of nonbearing walls, nonbearing
partitions, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, may be performed on any structure
devoted in whole or in part to, or that is accessory to, a nonconforming use;
provided, however, that this Section 14-2.2, shall not be deemed to authorize
any violation of this Section 14-2.
14-2.3 Structural Alteration. No structure devoted in whole or in part to, or that is
accessory to, a nonconforming use shall be structurally altered unless the use
thereof shall thereafter conform to the use regulations of the Zoning District in
which it is located.
14-2.4 Enlargement of Structure. No structure devoted in whole or in part to, or
that is accessory to, a nonconforming use shall be enlarged or added to in any
manner, including the interior addition of floor area, unless the use of such
structure shall thereafter conform to the use regulations of the Zoning District

thereafter conform to the use regulations of the Zoning District in which it is

nonconformity or increase the degree of the existing nonconformity of all or
any part of such structure. For the purposes of this Section 14-3.2, the vertical
or horizontal extension of a structure shall be considered to increase the
degree of an existing nonconformity related to a required yard or setback. In

this Code, the Municipal Code and the statutes of the State of
Illinois. The adoption, amendment or revision of such rules
shall be by a majority vote of all members of the Zoning
Administrative Body, subject to review and approval by the
Village Attorney and ratification by the Board of Trustees.
Every member of a Zoning Administrative Body shall be
furnished a copy of such proposed rules and any amendment or
revision thereto at least ten days before consideration for
adoption. Such rules shall be filed with the Staff Secretary of
such Zoning Administrative Body and with the Village Clerk.
Any rule so adopted that relates solely to the conduct of
meetings or hearings before such Zoning Administrative Body,
and that is not mandated by this Code or the statutes of the
State of Illinois, may be waived by the Chairman of such
Zoning Administrative Body upon good cause being shown.
f. Record. The transcript of testimony, if any; the approved minutes of
the Zoning Administrative Body; all applications, requests, exhibits,
and papers filed in any proceeding before a Zoning Administrative
Body; and the decision and report, or reports, of such Zoning
Administrative Body shall constitute the record. Each Zoning
Administrative Body may rely on the personal knowledge of its
members, on its inspections of the property, and on any reports
available to it; provided, however, that reliance on any specific factual
matter or report shall be made a matter of record at the public meeting
or hearing and every party shall be afforded reasonable time to
respond to it.
g. Decisions and Appeals. Every recommendation or decision of each
Zoning Administrative Body shall be by a motion set forth in the
minutes of the Zoning Administrative Body. Each such motion shall
include findings of fact; shall refer to all the evidence in the record and
to the exhibits, plans or specifications upon which such
recommendation or decision is based; shall specify the reason or
reasons for such recommendation or decision; shall contain a
conclusion or statement separate from the findings of fact setting forth
the specific relief granted or denying relief or setting forth the
recommendation of the Zoning Administrative Body; and shall
expressly set forth any limitations or conditions recommended or
imposed on any relief granted or recommended or work or uses
authorized.
1) Each Zoning Administrative Body may take final action on any
recommendation or decision pertaining to an application
LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE ARTICLE 15 - ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIALS
AND BODIES
301
pending before it prior to the preparation of written minutes,
but in such event it shall, before taking such action, first state
its findings and conclusions as above required at a meeting
open to the public. The written minutes incorporating such
findings and conclusions shall be presented and approved at the
next regular meeting of such Zoning Administrative Body open
to the public. The time for taking any appeal shall run from the
approval of such minutes.
2) In any case where this Code provides that the failure of a
Zoning Administrative Body to act shall within a set period be
deemed a grant or a denial of an application or a
recommendation for a grant or a denial of an application, such
failure shall be considered to be a decision or recommendation
of the Zoning Administrative Body to grant or deny such
application, as applicable, rendered on the day following the
expiration of such set period, notwithstanding the absence of
required findings and conclusions.
3) Decisions of the Zoning Board of Appeals made pursuant to
Sections 15-2.3.a.1. and 15-2.3.a.3. shall in all instances be
considered final administrative determinations and shall be
subject to appeal in the manner provided in Article III of the
Illinois Code of Civil Procedure pertaining to administrative
review. All other actions of any Zoning Administrative Body
shall be only recommendations to the Board of Trustees and
shall not constitute final decisions or determinations for any
purpose.
h. Conflicts. No member of a Zoning Administrative Body shall
participate in the hearing or disposition of any matter in which that
member has an interest as such term is defined in applicable state
statutes. Any conflict of interest prohibited by state law shall
disqualify a member.

thirty-five (35) days prior to the time when action on the application is

processed basis.
c. Supplemental Data. Whenever supplemental data in connection with a
previously filed application is required by the Village or offered by the
applicant, it shall be submitted at least twenty-one (21) days prior to
the date on which it is to be considered at a public hearing or a

LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS,
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
303
of such data shall, at the discretion of the Village Administrator, be
cause to delay a requested or scheduled hearing, meeting or decision
date.
16-1.4 Fees.
a. Fee Established; Lien. Every application filed pursuant to this Code
except those pertaining to one (1) single-family detached dwelling
shall be subject to an application and filing fee as established from
time to time by the Board of Trustees to recover the actual costs, as
hereinafter defined, incurred by the Village in processing such
application. The owner of the property subject of the application and,
if different, the applicant shall be jointly and severally liable for the
payment of said fee. By signing the application, the owner shall be
deemed to have agreed to pay such fee and to consent to the filing and
foreclosure of a lien on the subject property to ensure collection of any
such fee, plus the costs of collection, which has not been paid within
thirty (30) days following the mailing of a written demand for such
payment to the owner at the address shown on the application. Any
lien filed pursuant to this Section 16-1.4 may be foreclosed in the
manner provided by statute for mortgages or mechanics liens.
b. Recoverable Costs. For purposes of establishing the fee due pursuant
to Section 16-1.4, the actual costs incurred by the Village in

items of direct and indirect expense:
1) Legal Publication (direct cost);
2) Recording Secretarial Services (direct cost);
3) Court Reporter (direct cost);
4) Administrative Review and Preparation (hourly salary times a
multiplier sufficient to recover the direct and indirect cost of
such service);

multiplier sufficient to recover the direct and indirect cost of
such service);

7) Legal Review, Consultation, Advice, and Drafting (direct cost);
8) Copy Reproduction (direct cost); and
9) Document Recordation (direct cost).
c. Condition of All Applications, Approvals, and Permits; Time Periods.
Except as provided in Section 16-1.4.d., no application filed pursuant
to this Code shall be considered complete unless and until all fees and
deposits due pursuant to this Section 16-1 have been paid. Every
ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS, LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
304
approval granted and every permit issued pursuant to this Code,
whether or not expressly so conditioned, shall be deemed to be
conditioned upon payment of fees as required by this Section 16-1.
When this Code provides that the passage of time without decision or
action shall be deemed an approval or a recommendation for approval,
such time periods shall be tolled during any period of nonpayment of
any required fee or deposit.
The failure to fully pay any such fee or deposit when due shall be
grounds for refusing to process an application and for denying or
revoking any permit or approval sought or issued with respect to the
land or development to which the unpaid fee or deposit relates.
d. Waiver for Specified Public Bodies. The provisions of this Section
16.1 may be waived by the Board of Trustees for fees applicable to
any application filed by any public body or agency deriving the
majority of its revenues from taxes levied within the Village.
16-1.5 Minimum Data Requirements. Every application submitted pursuant to this
Code shall contain such information as is required by order of the Village
Administrator.
16-1.6 Special Data Requests. In addition to the data and information required
pursuant to this Section 16.1 and by general rules and orders adopted and
issued pursuant to this Code, every applicant shall submit such other and
additional data, information, or documentation as the Village Administrator or
any official, board or commission before which its application is pending may
deem necessary or appropriate to a full and proper consideration and
disposition of the particular application.
16-1.7 Waiver of Application Requirements. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Section 16.1, the Village Administrator shall have the authority to
waive any requirement set forth in, or imposed pursuant to, Sections 16-1.1,
16-1.2, 16-1.3 or 16-1.5 when, in his or her judgment, such waiver is
appropriate in light of the nature and extent of the relief being sought or in
light of special circumstances making compliance with those provisions either
unnecessary or unduly burdensome; provided, however, that any official
board or commission before which such application may come shall continue
to have the right to request additional information pursuant to Section 16-1.6
and to delay processing of such application until such information is provided
and made available in accordance with the deadlines established in Section
16-1.3.
16-1.8 Concurrent Applications. When a proposed use or development requires
more than one approval from the same official, board or commission,
LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS,
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
305
applications for all such approvals may be filed concurrently notwithstanding
the fact that approval of one application may be a pre-condition to approval of
other applications. Such applications may, in the discretion of the official,
officials, body, or bodies charged with review of such applications be
processed together; provided, however, that no application shall be approved
unless all applications that are a pre-condition to its approval have first been
approved.
16-1.9 Withdrawal of Application. An applicant may, providing that all fees due
pursuant to the Code have first been paid, withdraw an application at any time
prior to a final decision having been rendered with respect thereto. Such
withdrawal shall be without prejudice to the applicant's right to re-file such
application, but any such re-filing shall be treated as an entirely new filing and
shall be subject to the procedures and fees of this Code in the same manner as
any other new application.
16-2 SUCCESSIVE APPLICATIONS
16-2.1 Second Applications Without New Grounds Barred. Whenever any
application filed pursuant to this Code has been finally denied on its merits, a
second application seeking essentially the same relief, whether or not in the
same form or on the same theory, including without limitation a request to the
Board of Trustees for a variation pursuant to Section 16-8 of this Code within
one (1) year following a denial of lesser but essentially the same relief by the
Zoning Board of Appeals pursuant to Section 16-8 of this Code, shall not be
brought unless in the opinion of the official, board, or commission before
which it is brought there is substantial new evidence available or a mistake of
law or fact significantly affected the prior denial.
16-2.2 New Grounds to Be Stated. Any such second application shall include a
detailed statement of the grounds justifying consideration of such application.
16-2.3 Summary Denial With or Without Hearing. Any such second application
may be denied by the Village Administrator summarily, and without hearing,
on a finding that no grounds appear that warrant a new hearing. In any case
where such application is set for hearing, the applicant shall be required to
establish grounds warranting reconsideration of the merits of its application
prior to being allowed to offer any evidence on the merits. Unless such
grounds are established, the application may be summarily dismissed for such
failure.
16-2.4 Exception. Whether or not grounds are stated, any such second application
filed more than one year after the final denial of a prior application shall be
heard on the merits as though no prior application had been filed. The
applicant shall, however, be required to place in the record all evidence
ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS, LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
306
available concerning changes of conditions or new facts that have developed
since the denial of the first application. In the absence of such evidence, it
shall be presumed that no new facts exist to support the new petition that did
not exist at the time of the denial of the first application.
16-3 PUBLIC HEARINGS AND MEETINGS
16-3.1 Setting Hearing or Meeting. When the provisions of this Code require a
public hearing or public meeting in connection with any application filed

310
16-3.5 Pre-Hearing and Pre-Meeting Examination and Copying of Application
and Other Documents. At any time following the giving of notice as

and documents upon reasonable request and payment of a fee as established

PART B - ZONING CERTIFICATES
16-4 ZONING CERTIFICATES OF COMPLIANCE
16-4.1 Purpose. The Zoning Certificate of Compliance provides an opportunity for
early staff review of all zoning applications and serves two general purposes.
The application for a Zoning Certificate of Compliance serves as an adjunct
to, and thus must be filed prior to or with, all other applications filed pursuant
to this Code with respect to a specific use or development proposal. When so
filed, it serves as a vehicle for routine plan review by the Village
Administrator prior to consideration of special requests by Zoning
Administrative Bodies, thus avoiding needless special reviews of defective
plans. Issuance of a Zoning Certificate of Compliance evidences that a
proposed use is in compliance with all provisions of this Code, except as
specifically noted in the Certificate.
16-4.2 Authority. The Village Administrator shall have authority to issue Zoning
Certificates of Compliance, but only in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 16-4.
16-4.3 Effect of Issuance of Zoning Certificate of Compliance. The issuance of a
Zoning Certificate of Compliance shall not authorize the establishment,
expansion, or extension of any use nor the development, construction,
relocation, alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but shall merely
authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any
additional permits and approvals that may be required by the codes and
ordinances of the Village, including but not limited to a Building Permit, a
Certificate of Occupancy, and subdivision approval.
16-4.4 Certificate Required. Unless a Zoning Certificate of Compliance shall have
first been obtained from the Village Administrator or the Village
Administrator shall have determined by administrative order that no Zoning
Certificate of Compliance is required:
LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS,
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
311
a. The construction, reconstruction, remodeling, alteration or moving of
any structure, including signs and fences, shall not be commenced; and
b. No land vacant on the effective date of this Code shall be used or
occupied for any purpose, except the raising of crops; and
c. The grading, excavation, or improvement of land preliminary to any
construction on, or use of, such land shall not be commenced; and
d. Building or other permits pertaining to the construction,
reconstruction, remodeling, alteration, or moving of any structure or
the use of any land or structure shall not be issued by the Village; and
e. No home occupation shall be established or maintained; and
f. No accessory or temporary use or structure shall be established or
maintained, except as provided in Article 9; and
g. No land shall be annexed to the Village.
In any case where a Zoning Certificate of Compliance is not required under
this Code, the Village Administrator shall, on written request, issue a
certificate of such fact.
16-4.5 Relation to Other Applications. Except as provided in Section 16-1.8 of this
Code, no application filed pursuant to Section 16-1 of this Code with respect
to a specific use or development proposal shall be processed unless an
application for a Zoning Certificate of Compliance shall first have been
received, processed, and approved, or denied solely on one or more grounds
that form the basis for the application filed pursuant to said Section 16-1. It is
the intent of this Section 16-4.5 that no application filed pursuant to Section
16-1 of this Code with respect to a specific use or development proposal shall
be processed until the Village Administrator is satisfied that the proposed use
or development complies with the provisions of this Code in all respects
except those within the scope of such application.
16-4.6 Procedure.
a. Application. Applications for Zoning Certificates of Compliance shall
be filed in accordance with the requirements of Section 16-1 of this
Code.
b. Action on Application. Within fourteen (14) days following receipt of
a completed application for a Zoning Certificate of Compliance, the
Village Administrator shall cause the application and related
submissions to be reviewed for compliance with this Code and shall
inform the applicant whether the application has been granted or
ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS, LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
312
denied. In any case where an application is granted, the Village
Administrator shall issue a Zoning Certificate of Compliance, which
shall state on its face, in bold type, that:
THIS CERTIFICATE DOES NOT SIGNIFY BUILDING CODE
REVIEW OR APPROVAL AND IS NOT AUTHORIZATION TO
UNDERTAKE ANY WORK WITHOUT SUCH REVIEW AND
APPROVAL WHERE EITHER IS REQUIRED. SEE THE
LIBERTYVILLE BUILDING CODE FOR DETAILS.
BEFORE ANY STRUCTURE TO WHICH THIS CERTIFICATE IS
APPLICABLE MAY BE OCCUPIED OR USED FOR ANY
PURPOSE, A CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY MUST BE
OBTAINED. SEE SECTION 16-5 OF THE LIBERTYVILLE
ZONING CODE AND THE LIBERTYVILLE BUILDING CODE
FOR DETAILS.
In any case where an application is denied, the Village Administrator
shall state the specific reasons therefor and shall cite the specific
provisions of this Code upon which such denial is based. If relief from
such demand would be available pursuant to a companion application
filed in connection with the application for a Zoning Certificate of
Compliance, the Village Administrator shall so inform the applicant
and shall promptly process such companion application, if compete. If
such application is approved, the Village Administrator shall issue the
requested Zoning Certificate of Compliance in accordance with the
terms and conditions of such approval.
If relief from the Village Administrator's denial of a Zoning Certificate
of Compliance would be available by variation, special permit or site
plan review, but no application therefor has been filed, the Village
Administrator shall so state and shall refer the applicant to the
appropriate provisions of this Code.
c. Contents of Certificate. Each Zoning Certificate of Compliance issued
pursuant to this Section 16-4 shall state the specific use of the subject
property for which it is issued, shall identify the specific plans, if any,
pursuant to which it is issued, and shall set forth any conditions
imposed in connection with any approval granted pursuant to this
Code.
d. Filing of Certificates. Every Zoning Certificate of Compliance issued
pursuant to this Section 16-4 shall be kept on file in the Office of the
Village Administrator and shall be a public record open to inspection
in accordance with the provisions of the Illinois Freedom of
Information Act.
LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS,
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
313
16-4.7 Limitations on Certificates. A Zoning Certificate of Compliance shall
become null and void six (6) months after the date on which it was issued
unless within such period construction, reconstruction, remodeling, alteration
or moving of a structure is commenced or a use is commenced.
16-4.8 Void Certificates. Any Zoning Certificate of Compliance issued in violation
of the provisions of this Code, whether intentionally, negligently, or
innocently, shall be void ab initio and shall give rise to no rights whatsoever.

PART C - INTERPRETATIONS, APPEALS, AND VARIATIONS
16-6 INTERPRETATIONS
16-6.1 Purpose. The interpretation authority established by this Section 16-6 is
intended to recognize that the provisions of this Code, though detailed and
lengthy, cannot possibly address every specific situation to which they may
have to be applied. Many such situations, however, can be readily addressed
by an interpretation of the specific provisions of this Code in light of the
general and specific purposes for which those provisions have been enacted.
Because the interpretation authority herein established is an administrative
rather than a legislative authority, it is not intended to add to or change the
essential content of this Code but rather is intended only to allow authoritative
application of that content to specific cases.
16-6.2 Authority. The Village Administrator, subject to the procedures, standards,
and limitations of this Section 16-5, may render interpretations, including use
interpretations, of the provisions of this Code and of any rule or regulation
issued pursuant to it.
16-6.3 Parties Entitled to Seek Interpretations. Applications for interpretations
may be filed by any person having an interest in the circumstances giving rise
to the need for an interpretation; provided, however, that interpretations shall
not be sought by any person based solely on hypothetical facts or where the
interpretation would have no effect other than as an advisory opinion.
16-6.4 Procedure.
a. Application. Applications for interpretations of this Code shall be
filed in accordance with the requirements of Section 16-1 of this Code.
b. Action on Application. Within thirty-five (35) days after the receipt of
a properly completed application for interpretation, the Village
Administrator shall inform the applicant in writing of his or her
interpretation, stating the specific precedent, reasons, and analysis
upon which the determination is based. The failure of the Village
Administrator to act within such thirty-five (35) days, or such further
time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a
decision denying the application rendered on the day following such
period.
c. Appeal. Appeals from interpretations rendered by the Village
Administrator may be taken to the Zoning Board of Appeals as
provided in Section 16-7 of this Code.

16-6.5 Standards for Use Interpretations. The following standards shall govern
the Village Administrator, and the Zoning Board of Appeals on appeals from
the Administrator, in issuing use interpretations:
a. No use interpretation, except with regard to Home Occupations, shall
be given with respect to the Residential Districts.
b. Any use defined in Article 2 of this Code shall be interpreted as
therein defined.
c. No use interpretation shall permit a use listed as a permitted use or a
special permit use in any district to be established in any district in
which such use is not so listed.
d. No use interpretation shall permit any use in any district unless
evidence shall be presented that demonstrates that it will comply with
each use limitation established for that particular district.
e. No use interpretation shall permit any use in a particular district unless
such use is substantially similar to other uses permitted or specially
permitted in such district and is more similar to such other uses than to
uses permitted or specially permitted in a less restrictive district.
f. If the proposed use is most similar to a use permitted only as a special
permit use in the district in which it is proposed to be located, then any
use interpretation permitting such use shall be conditioned on the
issuance of a special use permit for such use pursuant to Section 16-9
of this Code.
g. No use interpretation shall permit the establishment of any use that
would be inconsistent with the statement of purpose of the district in
question.
h. Subject to the foregoing conditions and limitations, the Village
Administrator may, in rendering use interpretations, refer to the North
American Industrial Classification System, Published 2007, and the
use classification methodology used therein as a reference.
16-6.6 Effect of Favorable Use Interpretation. No use interpretation finding a
particular use to be permitted or specially permitted in a particular district
shall authorize the establishment of such use nor the development,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or
structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of
applications for any permits and approvals that may be required by the codes
and ordinances of the Village.
ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS, LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
316
16-6.7 Limitations on Favorable Use Interpretations. Subject to an extension of
time granted by the Village Administrator pursuant to Section 15-1.12 of this
Code, no use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or
specially permitted in a particular district shall be valid for a period longer
than six (6) months after the date of issue unless a building permit is issued
and construction is actually begun within that period and is thereafter
diligently pursued to completion, or a Zoning Certificate of Occupancy is
obtained and the use is commenced within that period.
A use interpretation finding a particular use to be permitted or specially
permitted in a particular district shall be deemed to authorize only the
particular use for which it was issued, and such interpretation shall not be
deemed to authorize any allegedly similar use for which a separate use
interpretation has not been issued. Such interpretation shall automatically
expire and cease to be of any force or effect if the particular use for which it
was issued shall, for any reason, be discontinued for a period of six (6)
consecutive months or more.
16-7 APPEALS
16-7.1 Purpose. The appeal procedure is provided as a safeguard against arbitrary,
ill-considered, or erroneous administrative decisions. It is intended to avoid
the need for resort to legal action by establishing local procedures to review
and correct administrative errors. It is not, however, intended as a means to
subvert the clear purposes, meanings, or intents of this Code or the rightful
authority of the Village Administrator to enforce the requirements of this
Code. To these ends, the reviewing body should give all proper deference to
the spirit and intent embodied in the language of this Code and to the
reasonable interpretations of that language by those charged with the
administration of this Code.
16-7.2 Authority. Except as provided in Section 16-10 of this Code with regard to
site plan review appeals, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide
appeals from, and review orders, decisions, determinations, or the failure to
act, of the Village Administrator acting pursuant to his or her authority and
duties under this Code and, to that end, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
have the same powers and be subject to the same standards and limitations as
the Administrator with respect to any order, decision, or determination being
appealed.
16-7.3 Parties Entitled to Appeal. An application for appeal to the Zoning Board of
Appeals may be filed by any person aggrieved by an order, decision,
determination, or failure to act of the Village Administrator acting pursuant to
his or her authority and duties under this Code.
LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS,
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
317
16-7.4 Procedure.
a. Application. An application for appeal to the Zoning Board of
Appeals shall be filed not later than forty-five (45) days after the
action being appealed and in accordance with the requirements of
Section 16-1 of this Code.
b. Action by Village Administrator. Upon receipt of a properly
completed application for an appeal, the Village Administrator shall
forthwith transmit to the Zoning Board of Appeals the application
together with all papers constituting the record upon which the action
appealed from was taken.
c. Public Meeting. A public meeting shall be set, noticed, and conducted
by the Zoning Board of Appeals in accordance with Section 16-3 of
this Code.
d. Action by Zoning Board of Appeals. Within sixty (60) days after the
close of the public meeting, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall render
a decision on the appeal in the manner and form specified in Section
15-2.4 of this Code. Such decision may reverse, affirm, or modify, in
whole or in part, the action appealed from and may include such order
or determination as, in the opinion of the Zoning Board of Appeals, is
proper to be made in the circumstances. The failure of the Zoning
Board of Appeals to act within such sixty (60) days, or such further
time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a
decision denying the appeal.
16-7.5 Stay of Proceedings. An application for appeal properly filed pursuant to
Section 16-7.4 of this Code shall stay all proceedings in the furtherance of the
action appealed from, unless the Village Administrator certifies to the Zoning
Board of Appeals after the application for appeal has been filed with the
Village Administrator that, by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay
would, in the Village Administrator's opinion, cause imminent peril to life or
property, in which case the proceedings shall not be stayed other than by a
restraining order, which may be granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals or by
the Circuit Court on application, upon reasonable written notice to the Village
Administrator and on due cause shown.
16-7.6 Right to Hear Variation in Deciding Appeals. In any case where the
application for appeal is accompanied by an application for variation in
accordance with Section 16-8 of this Code, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
notice, hear, review, and make a recommendation to the Board of Trustees on,
or shall grant or deny, such variation in compliance with the provisions of said
Section 16-8 of this Code.
ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS, LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
318
16-7.7 Conditions and Limitations on Rights Granted by Appeal. In any case
where this Code imposes conditions and limitations upon any right, any such
right granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals on appeal shall be subject to
such conditions and limitations in the same manner and to the same extent as
if secured without the necessity of an appeal.
16-8 VARIATIONS
16-8.1 Purpose. The variation procedure is intended to provide a narrowly
circumscribed means by which relief may be granted from unforeseen
particular applications of this Code that create practical difficulties or
particular hardships. When such difficulties or hardships are more appropriate
for remedy, if at all, pursuant to other provisions of this Article 16, the
variation procedure is necessarily inappropriate.
16-8.2 Authority. In accordance with the procedures and standards set out in this
Section 16-8, the Board of Trustees by ordinance duly adopted, and the
Zoning Board of Appeals by written order, shall have the authority to grant
variations from the provisions of this Code, but only in those specific
instances enumerated in Sections 16-8.5 and 16-8.6 and then only in
accordance with each of the standards enumerated in Section 16-8.7.
16-8.3 Parties Entitled to Seek Variations. Applications for variations may be filed
by the owner of, or any person having a contractual interest in, the subject
property.
16-8.4 Procedure.
a. Pre-application Conference.
1) Request. In any case where a variation is to be sought pursuant
to this Section 16-8, the applicant shall request a preapplication
conference with the Village Administrator prior to
filing his or her application.
2) Required Information. Prior to scheduling a pre-application
conference, the applicant shall provide required information to
the Village Administrator, including, but not limited to, a brief
and general description of the nature, location, and extent of
the proposed variation.
3) Procedure. Upon receipt of all required information, the
Village Administrator shall promptly schedule such conference
and notify the applicant of the time and place of such
conference and of the names and affiliations of other persons
who have been invited to attend. The Village Administrator
shall conduct such conference, and its purpose shall be to
LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS,
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
319
broadly acquaint all other parties with the proposals, views,
and concerns of all other parties at a time when positions are
still flexible and adjustment is still possible.
b. Application. Applications for variations shall be filed in accordance
with the requirements of Section 16-1 of this Code.
c. Variations by Board of Trustees.
1) Public Hearing. In the case of a variation permitted pursuant
to Section 16-8.5, a public hearing shall be set, noticed, and
conducted by the Zoning Board of Appeals in accordance with
Section 16-3 of this Code.
2) Action by Zoning Board of Appeals. Within sixty (60) days
after the conclusion of the public hearing, the Zoning Board of
Appeals shall render its recommendation in the manner and
form specified in Section 15-2.4 of this Code, recommending:
(i) granting the variation, (ii) granting the variation with
conditions, (iii) granting a variation less than or different from
the variation sought or (iv) denying the variation. The failure
of the Zoning Board of Appeals to act within such sixty (60)
days, or such further time to which the applicant may agree,
shall be deemed a recommendation to grant the variation.
3) Action by Board of Trustees. Within sixty (60) days or longer
if agreed upon by the Village and applicant after the receipt of
the recommendation of the Zoning Board of Appeals, or its
failure to act as above provided, the Board of Trustees shall
either deny the application or, by ordinance duly adopted, shall
grant the variation, with or without modification or conditions;
provided, however, that no variation shall be granted within six
(6) months after the effective date of this Code or of any
comprehensive amendment to this Code unless such variation
is passed by a two-thirds vote of the Corporate Authorities then
holding office; and provided further, however, that if the
proposed variation did not receive, or is not deemed by this
Code to have received, a favorable recommendation of the
Zoning Board of Appeals, such variation shall not be passed
except by a two-thirds vote of all the Trustees then holding
office. The failure of the Board of Trustees to act within such
forty-five (45) days, or such further time to which the applicant
may agree, shall be deemed a decision denying the variation
rendered on the day following such period.

HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
320
d. Variations by Zoning Board of Appeals.
1) Public Hearing. In the case of a variation permitted pursuant
to Section 16-8.6, a public hearing shall be set, noticed, and
conducted by the Zoning Board of Appeals in accordance with
Section 16-3 of this Code.
2) Action by Zoning Board of Appeals. Within ten (10) days after
the conclusion of the public hearing, the Zoning Board of
Appeals shall render a decision in the form specified by
Section 15-2.4.g of this Code, either: (i) granting the variation,
(ii) granting the variation with conditions, (iii) granting a
variation less than or different from the variation sought or (iv)
denying the variation; provided, however, that no variation
shall be granted within six (6) months after the effective date of
this Code or of any comprehensive amendment to this Code
unless such variation is passed by a two-thirds vote of the
members of Zoning Board of Appeals then holding office. The
failure of the Zoning Board of Appeals to act within such ten
(10) days, or such further time to which the applicant may
agree, shall be deemed a decision granting the variation.
16-8.5 Authorized Variations - Board of Trustees.
a. Permitted Variations. Subject to the prohibitions set forth in this
Section 16-8.5 and subject to the other provisions of this Section 16-8,
the Board of Trustees may vary the provisions of this Code in the
following cases and in no others:
1) To reduce certain yard, setback, and building spacing
requirements by one hundred (100%) percent the dimension of
a rear yard, side yard, front yard or setback or building space.
2) To reduce by not more than ten percent (10%) the required lot
area or lot width of any lot; provided, however, that no such
variation shall permit either the development of more than one
(1) dwelling unit in addition to the number of dwelling units
that could be developed in the absence of such a variation or
any increase in the otherwise permitted maximum floor area
ratio.
3) To increase the maximum allowable building coverage or lot
coverage, but not by more than five percent (5%) of the district
requirement in the C-2 Downtown Community Commercial
District, the C-3 General Commercial District, and the O-1
Professional Services Office District and not by more than
LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS,
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
321
twenty percent (20%) of the district requirement in every other
district.
4) To increase the maximum allowable height of a building or
structure, but not by more than twenty-five percent (25%) of
the district requirement.
5) To vary certain parking and loading space requirements as
follows:
i) to vary, without limit, the location of any required
parking space or loading space and associated
circulation aisles, but not including any encroachment
into any required perimeter landscaped open space; and
ii) to vary, without limit, the required size of any parking
space or loading space; and
iii) to reduce by not more than twenty-five percent (25%)
or one (1) space, whichever is greater, the minimum
number of parking spaces or loading spaces otherwise
required.
6) To vary, without limit, the number of parking or loading spaces
required in connection with a change of use or an increase in
use intensity.
7) To increase the maximum distance that required parking is
permitted to be located from the zoning lot of the use for which
such parking is provided.

follows:
i) to reduce by not more than fifty percent (50%) the
amount of perimeter landscaped open space otherwise
required; and
ii) to allow, without limit, encroachment of required
parking spaces, loading spaces, and associated
circulation aisles into required perimeter landscaped
open space; and
iii) to allow a use or structure in any area on a lot in which
perimeter landscaped open space is required, but only if
the area in which the new use or structure is proposed
ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS, LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
322
to be located is appropriate for such use or structure,
and if all of the perimeter landscaped open space
required pursuant to Section 13-2 of this Code is
provided on the lot on which such use or structure is
located, and if establishment or construction of such use
or structure does not result in any reduction of the
amount of required perimeter landscaped open space.
iv) to reduce, without limit, the amount of perimeter
landscaped open space required in order to allow for the
alteration, modification or addition to an existing
structure or for the erection of any new structure to be
located on the zoning lot of any permitted or special
permitted use located within the Institutional Buildings
District. However, no variation granting a reduction of
required perimeter landscaped open space in excess of
fifty percent (50%) along any lot line which abuts a
Residential District shall be valid unless the Applicant
has first obtained approval of a landscaping plan by the
Board of Trustees. Said landscaping plan shall be
designed to provide appropriate screening of the
structure to be erected within the required perimeter
landscaped open space and shall first be submitted by
the Applicant to the Appearance Review Commission
for its review. The Appearance Review Commission
shall consider the plan and submit its recommendations
regarding said plan to the Board of Trustees. Following
receipt of the recommendation of the Appearance
Review Commission, the Board of Trustees shall, by a
majority of the Trustees then holding office, either
approve the plan as submitted, approve the plan with
changes as recommended by the Appearance Review
Commission, approve the plan with changes as may be
required by the Board of Trustees, or reject the plan and
deny or revoke the variation requested by the
Applicant.
v) to reduce, without limit, the amount of perimeter
landscaped open space required, but only within an
outdoor storage area which is permitted or specially
permitted in an Industrial District and which is fully
enclosed in compliance with the requirements of
Section 13-5.1 of this Code.

9) To allow the moving of a nonconforming use or structure to an
extent or in a manner not permitted by Section 14-2 or Section
14-3 of this Code.
10) To allow the otherwise prohibited restoration of a partially
damaged or destroyed structure devoted to a nonconforming
use or of a nonconforming structure, sign or fence.

has declared the structure to be unsafe.
12) To vary, without limit, the bulk, yard, setback, and space
requirements when a zoning lot, whether vacant or legally
used, is reduced in size, by reason of the exercise of the right of
eminent domain by an authorized governmental body or by
reason of a conveyance made under the specific threat of an
eminent domain proceeding, so that the remainder of said
zoning lot, or any structure or use on said zoning lot, does not
conform with one or more of such bulk, yard, setback, or space
requirements of the district in which said zoning lot is located.
13) To vary, except as limited in Section 16-8.5.a.16, the

16) To vary the regulations of Section 13-9.1.d of this Code related
to the appearance of fences; provided, however, that no such
variation shall permit the fence supports to face the exterior, or
finished side of a fence to face the interior of the lot line on
which the fence is located along a lot line, or any portion
thereof, that does not either (a) abut an active railroad right-ofway
or (b) with respect to fences located on residentially zoned
lots, abut a lot zoned in a Commercial District.

17) To allow public utility structures, other than buildings, which

permitted maximum floor area ratio in an IB, Institutional

street.
22) To vary the regulations of Section 13-5.2 of this Code related

such variation shall be allowed except in corner lots and when
no other practical location for a refuse enclosure is available on
the property.
23) To vary, without limit, the thirty-five foot (35') restriction
imposed by Section 5-2.4.c.1 of this Code upon the location of

right or entitlement for any applicant to a variation of any kind
or magnitude.
b. Prohibited Variations. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section 16-7.5, no variation shall be granted that (a) is intended as a
temporary measure only or (b) is greater than the minimum variation
necessary to relieve the particular hardship or practical difficulty
demonstrated by the applicant.
16-8.6 Authorized Variations - Zoning Board of Appeals.
a. Permitted Variations. Subject to the prohibitions set forth in this
Section 16-8.6, and subject to the other provisions of this Section 16-8,
the Zoning Board of Appeals may vary the provisions of this Code in
the following cases and in no others:
1) To reduce by not more than five percent (5%) the dimension of
any required yard, setback, or building spacing required
pursuant to this Code.
2) To increase the maximum allowable height of any fence.
Nothing in this 16-8.6 shall be construed to create any right or
entitlement for any applicant to a variation of any kind or magnitude.
b. Prohibited Variations. Notwithstanding any other provision of this

ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS, LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
326
16-8.7 Standards for Variations.
a. General Standard. No variation shall be granted pursuant to this
Section 16-8 unless the applicant shall establish that carrying out the
strict letter of the provisions of this Code would create a particular
hardship or a practical difficulty. Such a showing shall require proof
that the variation being sought satisfies each of the standards set forth
in this Section 16-8.7.
b. Unique Physical Condition. The subject lot is exceptional as compared
to other lots subject to the same provision by reason of a unique
physical condition, including the presence of an existing use, structure,
fence or sign, whether conforming or nonconforming; irregular or
substandard shape or size; exceptional topographical features; or other
extraordinary physical conditions peculiar to and inherent in the
subject lot that amount to more than a mere inconvenience to the
owner and that relate to or arise out of the lot or its existing
development rather than the personal situation of the current owner of
the lot.
c. Not Self-Created. The aforesaid unique physical condition is not the
result of any action or inaction of the owner or its predecessors in title,
other than the construction of structures that were lawful at the time of
such construction, and existed at the time of the enactment of the
provisions from which a variation is sought or was created by as a
result of natural forces or governmental action, other than the adoption
of this Code.
d. Denied Substantial Rights. The carrying out of the strict letter of the
provision from which a variation is sought would deprive the owner of
the subject lot of substantial rights commonly enjoyed by owners of
other lots subject to the same provision.
e. Not Merely Special Privilege. The alleged hardship or difficulty is
neither merely the inability of the owner or occupant to enjoy some
special privilege or additional right not available to owners or
occupants of other lots subject to the same provision, nor merely the
inability of the owner to make more money from the use of the subject
lot; provided, however, that where the standards set out in this Section
16-8.7 are met, the existence of an economic hardship shall not be a
prerequisite to the grant of a variation.
f. Code and Plan Purposes. The variation would not result in a use or
development of the subject lot that would be not in harmony with the
general and specific purposes for which this Code and the provision
LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS,
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
327
from which a variation is sought were enacted or the general purpose
and intent of the Official Comprehensive Plan.
g. Essential Elements of the Area. The variation would not result in a use
or development on the subject lot that:
1) Would be materially detrimental to the public welfare or
materially injurious to the enjoyment, use, development, or
value of property or improvements permitted in the vicinity; or
2) Would materially impair an adequate supply of light and air to
the properties and improvements in the vicinity; or
3) Would substantially increase congestion in the public streets
due to traffic or parking; or
4) Would unduly increase the danger of flood or fire; or
5) Would unduly tax public utilities and facilities in the area; or
6) Would endanger the public health or safety.
h. No Other Remedy. There is no means other than the requested
variation by which the alleged hardship or difficulty can be avoided or
remedied to a degree sufficient to permit a reasonable use of the
subject lot.
16-8.8 Variation Less Than Requested. A variation less than or different from that
requested may be granted when the record supports the applicant's right to
some relief but not to the relief requested.
16-8.9 Conditions on Variations. The Board of Trustees or the Zoning Board of
Appeals may impose such specific conditions and limitations concerning use,
construction, character, location, landscaping, screening, and other matters
relating to the purposes and objectives of this Code upon any lot benefitted by
a variation as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent or minimize adverse
effects upon other property and improvements in the vicinity of the subject lot
or upon public facilities and services. Such conditions shall be expressly set
forth in the ordinance or motion granting the variation. Violation of any such
condition or limitation shall be a violation of this Code and shall constitute
grounds for revocation of the variation.
16-8.10 Effect of Grant of Variation. The grant of a variation shall not authorize the
establishment or extension of any use nor the development, construction,
reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or structure, but shall
merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of applications for any
permits and approvals that may be required by the codes and ordinances of the
Village.
Except when otherwise provided in this Code or in the ordinance or motion
granting a variation, every variation granted pursuant to this Section 16.8 shall
ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS, LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
328
be deemed to relate to, and be for the benefit of, the use and lot in question
rather than the owner or operator of such use or lot.
16-8.11 Limitations on Variations. Subject to an extension of time granted by the
Village Administrator pursuant to Section 15-1.12 of this Code, no variation
from the provisions of this Code shall be valid for a period longer than one (1)
year unless a building permit is issued and construction is actually begun
within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion or unless
a Zoning Certificate of Occupancy is issued and the use is commenced within
that period.
A variation shall be deemed to authorize only the particular construction or
development for which it was issued and shall automatically expire and cease
to be of any force or effect if such construction or development shall be
removed and not replaced within six (6) months after such removal.
16-8.12 Minimal Relief Application (MRA). A request for a variation from the strict
application of the zoning ordinance for any single-family, single family
attached and two-family uses. An MRA may be used only when the relief
sought varies by ten percent (10%) or less from the numerical requirements of
the Zoning Code. An MRA applies only to structures and not to uses. An
MRA may only be granted for Minimum Yard requirements for front, rear and
corner side yard setbacks. The MRA shall not be granted for any Specified
Structures or Uses in Required Yards which are permitted under the Zoning
Code.
a. Requirements for Application. An application for any MRA may be
filed with the Village Administrator by the legal or equitable owner or
a contract purchaser of the subject property. An application for MRA
shall be on a form provided by the Village Administrator and shall
contain a detailed statement of the purpose for which the MRA is
sought. Applications must be accompanied by all necessary
information, exhibits and other fees as required by the village for the
requested action.
b. Notification. Notification is required in conformance with Section 16-
3.2 of Zoning Code.
c. Conditions on MRAs. The Village may impose any condition or
limitation concerning use, construction, character, location,
landscaping, screening and other matters relating to the purposes and
objectives of this Code upon the premises benefited by an MRA. Such
conditions may be as necessary or appropriate to prevent or minimize
any adverse impact on other properties or improvements in the area or
upon public facilities and services. Violation of any such condition or
LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS,
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
329
limitation shall be a violation of this code and shall constitute grounds
for revocation of the MRA by the Village of Libertyville.
d. Occupancy Certificates. Any structure for which an MRA has been
granted shall comply with all conditions imposed on the grant of MRA
before a final occupancy certificate may be issued.
e. Fee Schedule. Any application filed pursuant to this Code shall be
subject to an application and filing fee as established from time to time
by the Board of Trustees to recover the actual costs, as identified in
Section 16-1.4 of this Code, incurred by the Village in processing such
application.
f. Effect of Grant of MRA. The grant of an MRA shall not authorize the
establishment or extension of any use nor the development,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or
structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and
processing of applications for any permits and approvals that may be
required by the codes and ordinances of the Village.
Except when otherwise provided in this Code or in the ordinance or
motion granting an MRA, every MRA granted pursuant to this Section
16.8 shall be deemed to relate to, and be for the benefit of, the use and
lot in question rather than the owner or operator of such use or lot.
g. Limitations on MRA. Subject to an extension of time granted by the
Village Administrator pursuant to Section 15-1.12. of this Code, no
MRA from the provisions of this Code shall be valid for a period
longer than one (1) year unless a building permit is issued and
construction is actually begun within that period and is thereafter
diligently pursued to completion or unless a Zoning Certificate of
Occupancy is issued and the use is commenced within that period.
h. Matters to be Considered in Deciding Whether or Not to Grant an
MRA. The applicant must provide actual evidence on each of the
following issues as it pertains to the applicant's request:
1) To what extent is the applicant responsible for the condition
that is the subject of the request?
2) Was the regulation from which relief is sought in existence
when the applicant either purchased or improved the property?
3) Has the applicant changed the property in some way so as to
create the problem condition?
ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS, LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
330
4) Might the applicant have taken some action in the past to
prevent or avoid the problem, which is the subject of the
request?
5) Will the relief requested adversely affect public health, safety
or welfare?
6) Is there a reasonable alternative, which is consistent with the
zoning ordinance? (If there is such an alternative, but the
applicant believes the additional cost is prohibitive, then it is
the applicant's burden to set forth the cost of each alternative.)
7) Will the relief requested exceed the minimum necessary to
accomplish the applicants stated purpose?
8) Will the relief requested be out of character with the
neighborhood?
9) Are there other structures within the same zoning district in the
Village, which either violate or have received a variation from
the same regulation?
i. Procedures When an MRA is Requested. An application for an MRA
shall be submitted to the Village on a form provided by the Village
Administrator. The MRA shall be reviewed and decided in
accordance with the following procedure:
1) Notification. Notification is required in conformance with
Section 16-3.2 of Zoning Code.
2) Village Administrators Report. If no written objection to the
MRA application and notice is received within fifteen (15)
days following the required mailing, the Village Administrator
or his designate may grant the requested relief.
3) Hearing on an MRA before the Zoning Board of Appeals. If
the Village Administrator denies the application, or if the
applicant disagrees with the conditions attached by the Village
Administrator, or if a written objection is received, then only
the Zoning Board of Appeals may approve the request after
conducting a hearing in accordance with the procedures
specified in this article for Variations.
j. Dilatory Applications. If an applicant applies for an MRA after the
applicant, or the applicant's predecessor, acted in violation of this
Code or a previously granted MRA, then no other MRA may be
granted, unless as a condition of the requested relief, the applicant
pays for all Village costs associated with the violation activity,
including, but not limited to, staff time, engineering, legal fees and any
other costs associated with the Villages enforcement and review
efforts.

PART D - SPECIAL PERMITS
16-9 SPECIAL USE PERMITS
16-9.1 Purpose. Special permit uses are those uses having some special impact or
uniqueness that requires a careful review of their location, design,
configuration, and special impact to determine, against fixed standards, the
desirability of permitting their establishment on any given site. They are uses
that may or may not be appropriate in a particular location depending on a
weighing, in each case, of the public need and benefit against the local impact
and effect.
16-9.2 Authority. The Board of Trustees, in accordance with the procedures and
standards set out in this Section 16-9 and by ordinance duly adopted, may
grant special use permits authorizing the development of uses listed as special
uses in the regulations applicable to the district in which the subject property
is located.
16-9.3 Parties Entitled to Seek Special Use Permits. An application for a special
use permit may be filed by the owner of, or any person having a contractual
interest in, the subject property.
16-9.4 Procedure.
a. Pre-application Conference.
1) Request. In any case where a special use permit is to be sought
pursuant to this Section 16-9, the applicant shall request a preapplication
conference with the Village Administrator prior to
filing his or her application.
2) Required Information. Prior to scheduling a pre-application
conference, the applicant shall provide required information to
the Village Administrator, including, but not limited to, a brief
and general description of the nature, location, and extent of
the proposed special permit use.
3) Procedure. Upon receipt of all required information, the
Village Administrator shall promptly schedule such conference
and notify the applicant of the time and place of such
conference and of the names and affiliations of other persons
who have been invited to attend. The Village Administrator
shall conduct such conference, and its purpose shall be to
broadly acquaint all other parties with the proposals, views,
and concerns of all other parties at a time when positions are
still flexible and adjustment is still possible.
ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS, LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
332
b. Application. Applications for special use permits shall be filed in
accordance with the requirements of Section 16-1 of this Code.
c. Public Hearing. A public hearing shall be set, noticed, and conducted
by the Plan Commission in accordance with Section 16-3 of this Code.
d. Action by Plan Commission. Within sixty (60) days after the
conclusion of the public hearing, the Plan Commission shall transmit
to the Board of Trustees its recommendation in the form specified in
Section 15-2.4 of this Code, recommending: (i) granting the special
use permit, (ii) granting the special use permit subject to modifications
or conditions, or (iii) denying the special use permit. The failure of the
Plan Commission to act within such sixty (60) days, or such further
time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed a
recommendation for the approval of the special use permit.
e. Action by Board of Trustees. Within sixty (60) days or longer if
agreed upon by the Village and the applicant after the receipt of the
recommendation of the Plan Commission, or its failure to act as above
provided, the Board of Trustees shall either deny the special use permit
or, by ordinance duly adopted, grant the special use permit, with or
without modifications or conditions; provided, however, that if the
proposed special use permit did not receive, or is not deemed by this
Code to have received, a favorable recommendation of the Plan
Commission, such special use permit shall not be passed except by a
majority vote of all the Trustees then holding office. The failure of the
Board of Trustees to act within such forty-five (45) days, or such
further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed a
decision denying the special use permit rendered on the day following
such period.
16-9.5 Standards for Special Use Permits.
a. General Standards. No special use permit shall be recommended or
granted pursuant to this Section 16-9 unless the applicant shall
establish that:
1) Code and Plan Purposes. The proposed use and development
will be in harmony with the general and specific purposes for
which this Code was enacted and for which the regulations of
the district in question were established and with the general
purpose and intent of the Official Comprehensive Plan.
2) Adverse Impact. The proposed use and development will not
have a substantial adverse effect upon adjacent property, the
character of the area, or the public health, safety, and general
welfare.
LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS,
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
333
3) Interference with Surrounding Development. The proposed use
and development will be constructed, arranged, and operated so
as not to dominate the immediate vicinity or to interfere with
the use and development of neighboring property in accordance
with the applicable district regulations.
4) Adequate Public Facilities. The proposed use and
development will be served adequately by essential public
facilities and services such as streets, public utilities, drainage
structures, police and fire protection, refuse disposal, parks,
libraries, and schools, or the applicant will provide adequately
for such services.
5) Traffic Congestion. The proposed use and development will
not cause undue traffic congestion nor draw significant
amounts of traffic through local streets and will, when required
by the Board of Trustees, incorporate appropriate vehicular trip
reduction features such as, but not limited to,
pedestrian/bicycle linkages within and between land uses, the
use of traffic mitigation plans, and the incorporation of
elements to encourage and facilitate the use of public
transportation.
6) Destruction of Significant Features. The proposed use and
development will not result in the destruction, loss, or damage
of any natural, scenic, or historic feature of significant
importance.
7) Compliance with Standards. The proposed use and
development complies with all additional standards imposed on
it by the particular provision of this Code authorizing such use.
b. Special Standards for Specified Special Permit Uses. When the
district regulations authorizing any special permit use in a particular
district impose use limitations that must be met by such use in such
district, a special permit use for that use in that district shall not be
recommended or granted unless the applicant shall establish
compliance with such special standards.
c. Considerations. In determining whether the applicant's evidence
establishes that the foregoing standards have been met, the Plan
Commission and the Board of Trustees shall consider:
1) Public Benefit. Whether, and to what extent, the proposed use
and development at the particular location requested is
necessary or desirable to provide a service or a facility that is in
the interest of the public convenience or that will contribute to
the general welfare of the neighborhood or community.
2) Alternative Locations. Whether, and to what extent, such
public goals can be met by the location of the proposed use and
ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS, LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
334
development at some other site or in some other area that may
be more appropriate than the proposed site.
3) Mitigation of Adverse Impacts. Whether, and to what extent,
all steps possible have been taken to minimize any adverse
effects of the proposed use and development on the immediate
vicinity through building design, site design, landscaping, and
screening.
16-9.6 Conditions on Special Use Permits. The Plan Commission may recommend
and the Board of Trustees may impose such conditions and limitations
concerning use, construction, character, location, traffic generation and
impacts, landscaping, screening, and other matters relating to the purposes and
objectives of this Code upon the premises benefitted by a special use permit as
may be necessary or appropriate to prevent or minimize adverse effects upon
other property and improvements in the vicinity of the subject property or
upon public facilities and services; provided, however, that such conditions
shall not be used as a device to grant a permit for a special permit use that is
intended to be temporary in nature. Such conditions shall be expressly set
forth in the ordinance granting the special use permit. Violation of any such
condition or limitation shall be a violation of this Code and shall constitute
grounds for revocation of the special use permit.
16-9.7 Effect of Issuance of a Special Use Permit. The grant of a special use
permit shall not authorize the establishment or extension of any use nor the
development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any
building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and
processing of applications for any permits or approvals that may be required
by the codes and ordinances of the Village.
A special use permit shall not, unless otherwise specifically stated in the
ordinance granting the special use permit, or except as otherwise provided in
Section 16-13.8 of this Code, prohibit the establishment of any other use
permitted as of right by the regulations of the district in which the premises
benefitted by the special use permit are located.
Except when otherwise provided in this Code or in the ordinance granting a
special use permit, a special permit use shall be deemed to relate to, and be for
the benefit of, the use and lot in question rather than the owner or operator of
such use or lot.
16-9.8 Limitations on Special Use Permits. Subject to an extension of time granted
by the Village Administrator pursuant to Section 15-1.12 of this Code, no
special use permit shall be valid for a period longer than one (1) year unless a
Building Permit is issued and construction is actually begun within that period
and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion or unless a Zoning
Certificate of Occupancy is issued and the use commenced within that period.
LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS,
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
335
A special use permit shall be deemed to authorize only the particular use for
which it was issued, and such permit shall automatically expire and cease to
be of any force or effect if such use shall, for any reason, be discontinued for a
period of six (6) consecutive months or more.
16-9.9 Amendments to Special Use Permits; Exemption for Minor Additions in
the IB Institutional Buildings District. A special use permit may be
amended, varied, or altered only pursuant to the procedures and subject to the
standards and limitations provided in this Section 16-9 for its original
approval; provided, however, that minor additions to special permits granted
in the IB Institutional Buildings District may be approved by an ordinance
adopted by the Board of Trustees without the necessity of following the other
procedures required by this Section 16-9 for its original approval if, but only if
such minor addition meets all of the standards established by this Section 16-
9.9, as well as each of the following additional standards:
a. The special permit use and the minor addition shall be on a zoning lot
five (5) acres or greater in size; and
b. The minimum yards provided for such minor addition shall be one and
one-half (1-1/2) times the minimum yards required by Section 8-3.5.d
of this Code; and
c. No aspect of any such minor addition violates any of the Standards for
Denial of Site Plan Permits set forth in Section 16-10.6.a of this Code.
For the purposes of this Section 16-9.9, a minor addition shall mean any
addition that does not, either individually, or in combination with all other
additions approved during the same calendar year, exceed fifteen thousand
(15,000) square feet in floor area.
16-10 SITE PLAN PERMITS
16-10.1 Purpose. The site plan permit process recognizes that even those uses and
developments that have been determined to be generally suitable for location
in a particular district are capable of adversely affecting the purposes for
which this Code was enacted unless careful consideration is given to critical
design elements. It is the purpose of this Section 16-10 to provide a vehicle
for the review of the developer's attention to such elements.
16-10.2 Authority. Except in the cases of uses and developments requiring a special
use permit pursuant to Section 16-9 of this Code other than planned
developments, and except in any case involving a site with a gross area of ten
(10) acres or more, the Village Administrator, in accordance with the
procedures and standards set out in this Section 16-10, may grant site plan
permits for uses and developments requiring such permits pursuant to Section
16-10.3. In case of uses and developments requiring a special use permit
ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS, LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
336
pursuant to Section 16-9 of this Code other than planned developments, and in
any case involving a site with a gross area of ten (10) acres or more, the Board
of Trustees, in accordance with the procedures and standards set out in this
Section 16-10 and by ordinance duly adopted, may grant site plan permits for
uses and developments requiring such permits pursuant to Section 16-10.3. A
site plan permit may also be sought by appeal to the Board of Trustees in any
case of a denial of a site plan permit by the Village Administrator.
16-10.3 Site Plan Permit Required.
a. Village Administrator Approval. A site plan permit issued by the
Village Administrator in accordance with this Section 16-10 shall be
required in connection with all development or redevelopment other
than any development or redevelopment where a site plan permit by
the Board of Trustees is required pursuant to Section 16-10.3.b, or for
the development or redevelopment of any individual single family
detached dwelling, any two family dwelling or any structure, paving or
landscaping accessory thereto.
b. Board of Trustees Approval. A site plan permit issued by the Board of
Trustees in accordance with this Section 16-10 shall be required in
connection with any development or redevelopment, other than a
"minor addition" as defined in Section 16-9.9 of this Code, for which
this Code requires a special use permit, excluding planned
development approval, or that involves a site with a gross area of ten
(10) acres or more. A site plan permit may also be sought by appeal to
the Board of Trustees in any case of a denial of a site plan permit by
the Village Administrator.
16-10.4 Parties Entitled to Seek Site Plan Permits. Applications for site plan
permits may be filed by the owner of, or any person having a contractual
interest in, the subject property.
16-10.5 Procedure.
a. Pre-application Conference.
1) Request. In any case where a site plan permit is to be sought
pursuant to this Section 16-10, the applicant may request a preapplication
conference with the Village Administrator prior to
filing his or her application.
2) Required Information. Prior to scheduling a pre-application
conference, the applicant shall provide required information to
the Village Administrator, including, but not limited to, a brief
and general description of the nature, location, and extent of
the proposed site plan.
LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS,
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
337
3) Procedure. Upon receipt of all required information, the
Village Administrator shall promptly schedule such conference
and notify the applicant of the time and place of such
conference and of the names and affiliations of other persons
who have been invited to attend. The Administrator shall
conduct such conference, and its purpose shall be to broadly
acquaint all other parties with the proposals, views, and
concerns of all other parties at a time when positions are still
flexible and adjustment is still possible.
b. Village Administrator Approvals.
1) Application. Applications for site plan permits to be issued by
the Village Administrator shall be filed in accordance with the
requirements of Section 16-1 of this Code.
2) Action by Village Administrator. Within thirty-five (35) days
after receipt by the Village Administrator of a properly
completed application, the Village Administrator shall cause
such application and the attached site plan to be reviewed, in
terms of the standards established by Section 16-10.6 and by
appropriate members of his or her staff. If the Village
Administrator determines that such review necessitates a
meeting between the applicant and Village Staff, the applicant
will be duly notified of such meeting and will be asked to
attend. The Village Administrator then shall either: (i) grant a
site plan permit for the site plan as submitted, with or without
conditions and limitations as specified in Section 16-10.7; or
(ii) on the basis of written findings in accordance with Section
16-10.6, grant a site plan permit subject to specific
modifications, with or without conditions and limitations as
specified in Section 16-10.7; or (iii) on the basis of such
findings, deny the site plan permit. In the case of any denial,
suggestions as required by Section 16-10.6.b shall be provided.
Immediately upon concluding his or her review, the Village
Administrator shall return one copy of the site plan to the
applicant marked to show either approval, with or without
conditions and limitations, approval subject to modifications,
with or without conditions and limitations, or denial of
approval. Any such modifications, conditions or limitations
shall be clearly and permanently marked on such plans. The
Village Administrator shall maintain a similarly marked set of
such plans in his or her files for any further processing that
may be required. The failure of the Village Administrator to
act within such thirty-five (35) days, or such further time to
ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS, LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
338
which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a
decision granting a site plan permit for the site plan as
submitted rendered on the day following such period.
3) Effect of Village Administrator's Action. The action of the
Village Administrator in granting a site plan permit for a site
plan, with or without conditions and limitations or in granting a
site plan permit for a site plan subject to modifications, with or
without conditions and limitations, shall constitute a final
administrative action and shall not be subject to further review
by, or appeal to, any Village board or commission; provided,
however, that any such modifications, conditions or limitations
are acceptable to the applicant. The action of the Village
Administrator in denying an application for a site plan permit
or in granting a site plan permit for a site plan subject to
modifications, conditions or limitations that are not acceptable
to the applicant (which action the applicant may treat as a
denial) shall not be considered final action by the Village but
shall only be authorization for the applicant to seek a site plan
permit from the Board of Trustees by way of the appeal
procedure set forth below.
c. Appeals. Within forty-five (45) days after a denial of a site plan
permit by the Village Administrator, the applicant may seek issuance
of the site plan permit by filing an application for appeal to the Board
of Trustees in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 16-
10.5.d below.
d. Board of Trustees Approvals: Original and Appellate.
1) Application. Applications for site plan permits to be issued by
the Board of Trustees shall be filed in accordance with the
requirements of Section 16-1 of this Code. In cases where
review by the Board of Trustees is sought by way of an appeal
of a denial of a site plan permit by the Village Administrator,
the application for appeal shall be filed within forty-five (45)
days after such denial.
2) Action by Village Administrator. Upon receipt of a properly
completed application for site a plan permit originally to be
issued by the Board of Trustees, the Village Administrator
shall forthwith transmit to the Plan Commission the application
for the site plan permit. Upon receipt of a properly completed
application for an appeal of a denial of a site plan permit by the
Village Administrator, the Village Administrator shall
forthwith transmit to the Plan Commission the application for
appeal, the original application for a site plan permit, all papers
LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS,
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
339
constituting the record upon which the Village Administrator's
denial was based, and a copy of the Village Administrator's
decision denying the application for the site plan permit.
3) Public Meeting. A public meeting shall be set, noticed, and
conducted by the Plan Commission in accordance with Section
16-3 of this Code.
4) Action by Plan Commission. Within thirty-five (35) days after
the conclusion of the public meeting, the Plan Commission
shall transmit to the Board of Trustees its recommendation, in
the form specified in Section 15-2.4 of this Code,
recommending either: (i) granting of a site plan permit for the
site plan as submitted, with or without conditions and
limitations as specified in Section 16-10.7; or (ii) on the basis
of written findings in accordance with Section 16-10.6,
granting of a site plan permit subject to specific modifications,
with or without conditions and limitations as specified in
Section 16-10.7; or (iii) on the basis of such findings, denial of
the site plan permit. In the case of any recommendation for
denial, suggestions as required by Section 16-10.6.b shall be
provided. The failure of the Plan Commission to act within
such thirty-five (35) days, or such further time to which the
applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a recommendation
for granting of a site plan permit for the site plan as submitted.
5) Action by Board of Trustees. Within sixty (60) days or longer
if agreed upon by the Village and applicant after the receipt of
the recommendation of the Plan Commission, or its failure to
act as above provided, the Board of Trustees, by ordinance
duly adopted, shall grant a site plan permit for the site plan as
submitted, with or without conditions and limitations as
specified in Section 16-10.7, or shall make modifications
acceptable to the applicant and grant a site plan permit for such
modified site plan, with or without conditions and limitations
as specified in Section 16-10.7, or shall deny the site plan
permit in the manner hereinafter specified either with or
without a remand to the Plan Commission for further
consideration. In the case of any denial, suggestions as
required by Section 16-10.6.b shall be provided. The failure of
the Board of Trustees to act within such forty-five (45) days, or
such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be
deemed to be a decision denying site plan permit rendered on
the day following such period.
16-10.6 Standards for Denial of Site Plan Permits.
a. Standards. Neither the Village Administrator nor the Board of
Trustees shall deny a site plan permit, and the Plan Commission shall
ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS, LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
340
not recommend the denial of a site plan permit for a site plan
submitted pursuant to this Section 16-10 except on the basis of specific
written findings directed to one or more of the following standards:
1) The application is incomplete in specified particulars or
contains or reveals violations of this Code or other applicable
regulations that the applicant, after written request, has failed
or refused to supply or correct.
2) The application has been submitted in connection with another
application, the approval of which is a condition precedent to
the necessity for site plan review, and the applicant has failed
to secure approval of that application.
3) The proposed site plan fails to meet adequately specified
standards required by this Code with respect to the proposed
use or development, including special use permit standards
where applicable.
4) The proposed site plan fails to meet the policies of the Village,
or requirements of relevant public utilities regarding protection
of, or development within or adjacent to, all easements or
rights-of-way.
5) The proposed site plan unnecessarily or unreasonably destroys
or detracts from the enjoyment of significant natural,
topographical, physical or historic features of the site,
including but not limited to:
i) Failing to provide adequate measures to preserve
existing healthy and long-lived trees wherever
practically feasible;
ii) Failing to design drainage facilities to promote the use
and preservation of natural watercourse and patterns of
drainage;
iii) Failing to avoid unnecessary or unreasonable alterations
to existing topography.
iv) Failing to include adequate protection for important
views and vistas as identified in adopted plans.
6) The proposed site plan fails to meet the Institute of Traffic
Engineers Transportation and Traffic Engineer's Handbook
standards, or other Village-adopted standards, for smooth and
efficient traffic flow either on- or off-site or to incorporate
appropriate vehicular trip reduction features such as, but not
limited to, pedestrian/bicycle linkages within and between land
uses, the use of traffic mitigation plans and the incorporation of
elements to encourage and facilitate the use of public
transportation.
LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS,
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS

7) The landscaping and screening of the site fails to provide
adequate shielding from, or for, nearby uses or relies on the use
of plant materials that are not compatible with the climate of
the region and micro-climate conditions on the site.
8) The proposed structures or landscaping are unreasonably
lacking in amenities in relation to, or are incompatible with,
nearby structures and uses.
9) In the case of site plans submitted in connection with an
application for a special use permit, the proposed site plan fails
to make adequate provision for the creation or preservation of
open space or for its continued maintenance.
10) The proposed site plan creates unreasonable drainage or
erosion problems or fails to integrate the site fully and
satisfactorily into the overall existing and planned drainage
systems serving the Village.
11) The proposed site plan places unwarranted or unreasonable
burdens on specified utility systems serving the site or area or
fails to integrate the site's utilities fully and satisfactorily into
the overall existing and planned utility systems serving the
Village.
12) The proposed site plan does not provide for required public
uses designated on the Official Map.
13) The proposed site plan otherwise adversely affects the public
health, safety, or general welfare, or is incompatible with
adjacent properties, in specified particulars.
14) In the case of site plans submitted for a site included within a
Planned Industrial District general development plan approved
pursuant to Section 26-194(j) of the Municipal Code as it
existed prior to the effective date of this Code and deemed
under Section 17-6.1 of this Code to be an approved Final Plan
pursuant to the provisions of Section 16-13.4.c of this Code,
the proposed site plan does not conform to the approved
general development plan as amended pursuant to Section 17-
16.1 of this Code.
b. Alternative Approaches. In citing any of the foregoing standards,
other than Sections 16-10.6.a.1 and 16-10.6.a.2, as the basis for
denying a site plan permit, the Village Administrator, the Plan
Commission or the Board of Trustees, as the case may be, shall
suggest alternate site plan approaches that could be developed to avoid
the specified deficiency or shall state the reasons why such deficiency
cannot be avoided consistent with the applicant's objectives.
16-10.7 Conditions on Site Plan Permits. The Village Administrator may impose,
and the Plan Commission may recommend and the Board of Trustees may
impose, such conditions and limitations concerning the standards set forth in
ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS, LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
342
Section 16-10.6 of this Code, as well as to other matters relating to the
purposes and objectives of this Code upon the premises benefitted by a site
plan permit as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent or minimize
adverse effects upon other property and improvements in the vicinity of the
subject property or upon public facilities and services; provided, however, that
such conditions shall not be used as a device to grant a site plan permit for a
use that is intended to be temporary in nature. Violations of any such
condition or limitation shall be a violation of this Code and shall constitute
grounds for revocation of the site plan permit. Such conditions and
limitations imposed by the Village Administrator shall be clearly and
permanently marked on such plans. Such conditions and limitations imposed
by the Board of Trustees shall be expressly set forth in the ordinance granting
the site plan permit.
16-10.8 Effect of Issuance of a Site Plan Permit. Issuance of a site plan permit shall
not authorize the establishment or extension of any use nor the development,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of any building or
structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation, filing, and processing of
applications for any permits or approvals that may be required by the codes
and ordinances of the Village.
A copy of every approved site plan shall be filed with the Village
Administrator and the development of the site shall be in conformity with
such approved and filed plan.
16-10.9 Limitations on Site Plan Permits. Subject to an extension of time granted
by the Village Administrator pursuant to Section 15-1.12 of this Code, no site
plan permit shall be valid for a period longer than one (1) year unless a
Building Permit is issued and construction is actually begun within that period
and is thereafter diligently pursued to completion or unless a Zoning
Certificate of Occupancy is issued and the use commenced within that period.
16-10.10 Adjustments to Site Plan During Development.
a. Site Plan Permits Issued by the Village Administrator. During the
development of the site, the Village Administrator may authorize
adjustments to a site plan originally approved by the Administrator.
b. Site Plan Permits Issued by the Board of Trustees.
1) Minor Adjustments. During the development of the site, the
Village Administrator may authorize minor adjustments to a
site plan approved on appeal by the Board of Trustees or
originally approved by the Board of Trustees when such
adjustments appear necessary in light of technical or
engineering considerations first discovered during actual
LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS,
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
343
development. Such minor adjustments shall be limited to the
following:
i) Altering the location of any one structure or group of
structures by not more than ten (10) feet or one-fourth
(1/4) of the distance shown on the approved site plan
between such structure or structures and any other
structure or any vehicular circulation element or any
boundary of the site plan, whichever is less.
ii) Altering the location of any circulation element by not
more than ten (10) feet or one-fourth (1/4) of the
distance shown on the approved site plan between such
circulation element and any structure, whichever is less.
iii) Altering the location of any open space by not more
than twenty (20) feet.
iv) Altering any final grade by not more than twenty
percent (20%) of the originally planned grade.
Any such minor adjustment approved pursuant to this Section
16-10.10.b.1 shall be consistent with the intent and purpose of
this Code and the site plan as approved, shall be the minimum
necessary to overcome the particular difficulty and shall not be
approved if they would result in a violation of any standard or
requirement of this Code.
2) Major Adjustments. Any adjustment to a site plan originally
approved by the Board of Trustees or approved on appeal by
the Board of Trustees that is not authorized by Section 16-
10.10.b.1 shall be considered to be a major adjustment and
shall be granted only upon application to, and approval by, the
Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees may, by ordinance
duly adopted, grant approval for a major adjustment without
referral to the Plan Commission upon finding that any changes
in the site plan as approved will be in substantial conformity
with said site plan. If the Board of Trustees determines that a
major adjustment is not in substantial conformity with the site
plan as approved, then the Board of Trustees shall refer the
request to the Plan Commission for further consideration and
review as provided in Section 16-10.5 of this Code.
c. Site Plan Adjustments. All such adjustments approved pursuant to this
Section 16-10.9 shall be clearly and permanently marked on both the
Village copy and the applicant's copy of the approved site plan.
16-10.11 Amendments to Site Plan Following Completion of Development. After a
site is developed in accordance with an approved site plan, the approved site
ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS, LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
344
plan may be amended, varied, or altered in the same manner and subject to the
same limitations, as provided for original approval of the site plan in question.
16-11 RESERVED
16-12 SIGN PERMITS
16-12.1 Purpose. The Sign Permit process provides a procedure for the review of
signs to ensure that all such signs will comply with the regulations of this
Code and other applicable Village codes, ordinances, and regulations.
16-12.2 Authority. The Village Administrator, in accordance with the procedures and
standards set out in this Section 16-12, may grant a Sign Permit for the
construction or maintenance of a sign requiring a permit pursuant to this
Section 16-12.
16-12.3 Sign Permit Required. Except only as provided in Section 11-7 of this Code

issued therefor; provided, however, that no sign permit shall be required for
routine maintenance of a sign or for changing the message on a sign including
changeable copy.
16-12.4 Parties Entitled to Seek Sign Permit. Applications for sign permits may be
filed by the owner of the property on which the sign is to be located or the
owner's authorized agent. No person, firm or corporation shall erect, alter, or

with the requirements of Section 16-1 of this Code.
b. Action on Application. The Village Administrator, within ten (10)
days after the submission of a properly completed application for a
sign permit and payment of all required fees, shall:
1) Determine whether referral to the Appearance Review
Commission is required pursuant to Section 16-12.6 and, if so,
notify the owner or applicant of the need for such referral; or
2) If referral to the Appearance Review Commission is not
required, issue a sign permit if the proposed sign conforms in
every respect with the requirements of this Code and has been
issued a Zoning Certificate of Compliance pursuant to Section
16-4; or
3) Deny the application if the proposed sign fails in any way to
conform with the requirements of this Code.
If the Village Administrator denies the application, then the Village
Administrator shall notify the applicant of the reasons for such denial.
16-12.6 Referral to Appearance Review Commission Required. Except as provided
in Sections 11-7 and 11-8 of this Code, and except for any wall sign

provisions of Chapter 7 Article II of the Municipal Code.
ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS, LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
346
16-12.7 Limitations on Sign Permits. Subject to an extension of time granted by the
Village Administrator pursuant to Section 15-1.12 of this Code, a sign permit
shall become null and void six (6) months after the date on which it was
issued unless the work authorized by such sign permit is commenced. A sign
permit shall relate solely to the work shown on plans approved by the issuance
of such sign permit and it shall be unlawful for any person to deviate from
such plans without obtaining an amended permit in the same manner as herein
provided for obtaining original permits.
16-12.8 Inspections. The Village may, at any time and from time to time, conduct an
inspection of any sign within the Village for the purpose of ascertaining
whether such sign is in compliance with the requirements of this Code.
LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS,

347
PART E - PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS
16-13 PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS
16-13.1 Purpose. Planned developments are included in this Code as a distinct
category of special permit uses. As such, they are authorized in the
Residential, Commercial, Office, Industrial, and IB Institutional Buildings
Districts for the same general purposes as all other special permit uses. In
particular, however, the planned development technique is intended to allow
the relaxation of otherwise applicable substantive requirements based upon
procedural protections providing for detailed review of individual proposals
for significant developments. This special regulatory technique is included in
this Code in recognition of the fact that traditional use, bulk, space, setback,
and yard regulations that may be useful in protecting the character of
substantially developed and stable areas may impose inappropriately rigid
regulations upon the development or redevelopment of parcels or areas that
lend themselves to an individual, planned approach. Through the flexibility of
the planned development technique, the Village seeks to achieve the following
specific objectives:
a. The creation of a more desirable environment than would be possible
through strict application of other Village land use regulations;
b. The efficient use of land resulting in smaller networks of utilities and
streets while lowering development and housing costs;
c. The promotion of a creative approach to the use of land and related
physical facilities resulting in better design and development,
including aesthetic amenities;
d. The combination and coordination of architectural styles, building
forms, and building relationships;
e. The preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics
such as natural topography, vegetation, and geologic features, and the
prevention of soil erosion;
f. The provision for the preservation and beneficial use of open space;
g. An increase in the amount of open space over that which would result
from the application of conventional subdivision and zoning
regulations; and
h. The encouragement of land uses that promote the public health, safety
and general welfare.
ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS, LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
348
However, the planned development process shall not be used merely to
subvert the purposes, regulations and requirements of this Code.
16-13.2 Authority. The Board of Trustees, in accordance with the procedures and
standards set out in this Section 16-13 and by ordinance duly adopted, may
grant special use permits authorizing the development of planned
developments, but only in the districts where such developments are listed as
an authorized special permit use.
16-13.3 Parties Entitled to Seek Planned Development Approval. An application
for a special use permit to permit a planned development may be filed by the
owner of, or any person having contractual interest in, the subject property.
16-13.4 Forms of Submittal for Planned Developments and Procedures.
a. Development Concept Plan.
Purpose. The Development Concept Plan is intended to provide the
applicant an opportunity to submit a plan showing the basic scope,
character, and nature of the entire proposed planned development
without incurring undue cost. The Development Concept Plan is the
basis on which the required public hearing is held, thus permitting
public consideration of the proposal at the earliest possible stage. To
permit the Village and the applicant to proceed with some assurance,
approval of the Development Concept Plan binds the applicant and the
Village with respect to the following basic elements of development:
i) categories of uses to be permitted;
ii) general location of residential and nonresidential land uses;
iii) overall maximum density of residential uses and intensity of
nonresidential uses;
iv) the general architectural style of the proposed development;
v) general location and extent of public and private open space,
including recreational amenities;
vi) general location of vehicular and pedestrian circulation
systems;
vii) staging of development;
viii) nature, scope, and extent of public dedications, improvements,
or contributions to be provided by the applicant; and
ix) specific bulk, space and yard requirements, including
maximum building height, minimum lot area and lot width, if
applicable, minimum yard along perimeter of site, maximum
floor area ratio, maximum lot coverage, minimum perimeter
landscaped open space and minimum parking requirements.
LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS,
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
349
b. Master Plan.
Purpose. The Master Plan is intended as an alternative to the
Development Concept Plan, to address those situations involving
larger parcels upon which an applicant intends to develop a planned
development in phases but does not intend to submit all elements of
the Master Plan for Final Plan Approval within one year of approval of
the Master Plan. The Master Plan is the basis on which the required
public hearing is held, thus permitting public consideration of the
proposal at the earliest possible stage. The Master Plan option shall
only be available for parcels which otherwise qualify for planned
development consideration and which are fifty (50) acres, or larger, in
total area. The Master Plan shall identify separate planning areas for
the entire property within the proposed planned development and shall
bind the applicant and the Village with respect to the following
elements of development within each identified planning area, as
follows:
i) permitted and specially permitted categories of uses within
each planning area identified by the Master Plan;
ii) overall maximum density of residential uses and intensity of
nonresidential uses;
iii) the general architectural style of the proposed development;
iv) general location and extent of public and private open space,
including recreational amenities;
v) general location of vehicular and pedestrian circulation
systems;
vi) nature, scope, and extent of public dedications, improvements,
or contributions to be provided by the applicant; and
vii) specific bulk, space and yard requirements, including
maximum building height, minimum lot area and lot width, if
applicable, minimum yard along perimeter of site, maximum
floor area ratio, maximum lot coverage, minimum perimeter
landscaped open space and minimum parking requirements.
c. Procedure.
1) Pre-application Conference.
i) Request. The applicant shall request a pre-application
conference with the Village Administrator prior to
filing his or her application for Development Concept
Plan or Master Plan for approval pursuant to this
Section 16-13.
ii) Required Information. Prior to scheduling a preapplication
conference, the applicant shall provide
ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS, LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
350
required information to the Village Administrator,
including, but not limited to, a brief and general
description of the nature, location, and extent of the
proposed Development Concept Plan or Master Plan.
iii) Procedure. Upon receipt of all required information, the
Village Administrator shall promptly schedule such
conference and notify the applicant of the time and
place of such conference and of the names and
affiliations of other persons who have been invited to
attend. The Village Administrator shall conduct such
conference, and its purpose shall be to broadly acquaint
all other parties with the proposals, views, and concerns
of all other parties at a time when positions are still
flexible and adjustment is still possible.
2) Application. Applications for approval of a Development
Concept Plan or Master Plan shall be filed in accordance with
the requirements of Section 16-1 of this Code.
3) Coordination with Subdivision Code. When a subdivision of
land subject to the Subdivision Code is proposed in connection
with a planned development, application for, review of and
approval of the preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision
shall be carried out simultaneously with application for, review
of and approval of the Development Concept Plan or Master
Plan.
4) Public Hearing. A public hearing shall be set, noticed, and
conducted by the Plan Commission in accordance with Section
16-3 of this Code.
5) Action by Plan Commission. Within sixty (60) days after the
conclusion of the public hearing, the Plan Commission shall
transmit to the Board of Trustees its recommendation, in the
form specified by Section 15-2.4 of this Code, that the
Development Concept Plan or Master Plan either be approved,
be approved subject to modifications or conditions, or not be
approved. The failure of the Plan Commission to act within
such sixty (60) days, or such further time to which the
applicant may agree, shall be deemed a recommendation for
the approval of the Development Concept Plan or Master Plan
as submitted.
6) Action by Board of Trustees. Within sixty (60) days after the
receipt of the recommendation of the Plan Commission or its
failure to act as above provided, the Board of Trustees shall
deny the application for approval of the Development Concept
Plan or Master Plan, or shall refer it back to the Plan
Commission for further consideration of specified matters, or,
by ordinance duly adopted, shall approve the Development
LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS,
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
351
Concept Plan or Master Plan, with or without modifications
and conditions to be accepted by the applicant as a condition of
such approval, and shall grant a special use permit authorizing
the proposed planned development and such additional
approvals as may be necessary to permit development of the
planned development as approved; provided, however, that if
the proposed Development Concept Plan or Master Plan did
not receive, or is not deemed by this Code to have received, a
favorable recommendation of the Plan Commission, such
Development Concept Plan or Master Plan and special use
permit authorizing the proposed planned development shall not
be passed except by a majority vote of all the Trustees then
holding office; and provided, further however, that every such
ordinance and special use permit shall be expressly conditioned
upon approval of a Final Plan in accordance with Section 16-
13.4.e or, in the case of a Master Plan in accordance with
Section 16-13.4.f and upon the permittees compliance with all
provisions of this Code and the ordinance granting the special
use permit.
The failure of the Board of Trustees to act within such sixty
(60) days, or such further time to which the applicant may
agree, shall be deemed to be a decision denying approval of the
Development Concept Plan or Master Plan rendered on the day
following such period.
7) Effect of Development Concept Plan and/or Master Plan
Approval. Unless the applicant shall fail to meet time
schedules for filing a Final Plan or shall fail to proceed with
development in accordance with the Development Concept
Plan or Master Plan, as approved or shall in any other manner
fail to comply with any condition of this Code or any approval
granted pursuant to it, the Village shall not, without the consent
of the applicant, take any action to modify, revoke, or
otherwise impair an approved Development Concept Plan or
Master Plan with respect to the elements of development set
forth in Section 16-13.4.a or 16-13.4.b (whichever is
applicable) pending the application for approval of a Final
Plan. In submitting an application for approval of a Final Plan,
the applicant shall be bound by the approved Development
Concept Plan or, if applicable, the Master Plan with respect to
each such element.
8) Time Limitations and Requirement for Five Year Review:
i) Time Limitation for Completion of Master Plan
Construction. The construction of all elements of the
ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS, LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
352
Master Plan must be completed not later than twenty
(20) years following approval of the Master Plan by the
Board of Trustees. Following the expiration of such
time period, any further construction commenced or
completed shall no longer be subject to nor benefitted
by the provisions of the Master Plan and any
construction commenced or completed thereafter shall
be subject to all of the then applicable provisions of this
Code.
ii) Five Year Review. Not earlier than fifty-four (54)
months following the approval of a Master Plan and not
later than five (5) years after such approval, the Plan
Commission shall conduct a public hearing to review
the progress and status of the Master Plan. At such
public hearing, the applicant shall provide an update as
to the status of the Master Plan and shall advise the
Plan Commission of the construction which has been
completed up until the date of such public hearing and
the construction which the applicant reasonably
believes will be completed within the five (5) year
period following such public hearing. The applicant
shall provide updates to the Plan Commission at
additional public hearings to be conducted not later than
every five (5) years thereafter. No such public hearing
shall be conducted earlier than fifty-four (54) months
following the previous public hearing held with respect
to the Master Plan.
d. Optional Simultaneous Submission of a Development Concept Plan
and Final Plan. The applicant may, at his or her option, submit a Final
Plan for the proposed planned development pursuant to the
requirements of Section 16-13.4.e, or 16-13.4.f simultaneously with
the submission of the Development Concept Plan or Master Plan
pursuant to the requirements of Section 16-13.4.a and Section 16-
13.4.b. In such case, the applicant shall comply with all provisions of
this Code applicable to submission of the Development Concept Plan
or Master Plan and to submission of the Final Plan. The Plan
Commission and the Board of Trustees shall consider such plans
simultaneously and shall grant or deny Final Plan approval in
accordance with the provisions of Section 16-13.4.e or, where
applicable, 16-13.4.f.
e. Final Plan Following Approval of Development Concept Plan.
1) Purpose. The Final Plan is intended to particularize, refine,
and implement the Development Concept Plan and to serve as
LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS,
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
353
a complete, thorough, and permanent public record of the
planned development and the manner in which it is to be
developed.
2) Application. Subject to an extension of time granted by the
Village Administrator pursuant to Section 15-1.12 of this Code,
within one (1) year after the date of approval of the
Development Concept Plan, the applicant shall file an
application for Final Plan approval in accordance with the
requirements of Section 16-1 of this Code. The application
may include the entire area included in the approved
Development Concept Plan or one or more stages or units
thereof in accordance with the staging plan, if any, approved as
part of the Development Concept Plan. The application shall
refine, implement, and be in substantial conformity with the
approved Development Concept Plan and at a minimum shall
include, where applicable, the following
i) A land use application;
ii) Proof of ownership;
iii) Property Owners authorization;
iv) Narrative;
v) Plat of Survey;
vi) Site Plan;
vii) Elevations of proposed structures;
viii) Preliminary engineering plan;
ix) Trees survey by a certified arborist;
x) Landscape plan;
xi) Lighting Plan;

4) Coordination with Subdivision Code. When a subdivision of
land subject to the Subdivision Code is proposed in connection
with a planned development, application for, review of and
approval of the final plat of the proposed subdivision shall be
carried out simultaneously with application for, review of and
approval of the Final Plan.
5) Action by Plan Commission.
i) Evaluation. Within sixty (60) days after the filing of an
application for approval of a Final Plan, the Plan
ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS, LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
354
Commission shall, with such aid and advice of the
Village staff and consultants as may be appropriate,
review and act on the plan. Such review shall consider:
a) whether the Final Plan is in substantial
conformity with the approved Development
Concept Plan;
b) the merit or lack of merit of any departure of the
Final Plan from substantial conformity with the
approved Development Concept Plan;
c) whether the Final Plan complies with any and
all conditions imposed by approval of the
Development Concept Plan; and
d) whether the Final Plan complies with the
provisions of this Code and all other applicable
federal, state, and Village codes, ordinances,
and regulations.
ii) Recommendation of Approval Based on Substantial
Conformity. If the Plan Commission finds substantial
conformity between the Final Plan and the approved
Development Concept Plan and further finds the Final
Plan to be in all other respects complete and in
compliance with any and all conditions imposed by
approval of the Development Concept Plan and with the
provisions of this Code and all other applicable Federal,
State, and Village codes, ordinances, and regulations, it
shall transmit the Final Plan to the Board of Trustees
with its recommendation, in the form specified in
Section 15-2.4 of this Code, that the Board of Trustees
approve the Final Plan, with or without modifications
and conditions to be accepted by the applicant as a
condition of approval; provided, however, that in no
event shall such conditions of approval impair the rights
granted by the Development Concept Plan approval.
iii) Recommendation of Approval without Substantial
Conformity. If the Plan Commission finds that the
Final Plan lacks substantial conformity to the approved
Development Concept Plan but merits approval
notwithstanding such lack of conformity and otherwise
conforms to the requirements of this Code, it shall
transmit the Final Plan to the Board of Trustees with its
recommendation, in the form specified in Section 15-
2.4 of this Code, that the Final Plan be approved, with
or without modifications and conditions to be accepted
by the applicant as a condition of approval.

HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
355
iv) Recommendation of Denial. If the Plan Commission
finds that the Final Plan is not in substantial conformity
with the approved Development Concept Plan and does
not merit approval, or if the Plan Commission requires
modifications of a plan or imposes conditions that are
not accepted by the applicant, the Plan Commission
shall transmit the Final Plan to the Board of Trustees
together with its recommendation, in the form specified
in Section 15-2.4 of this Code, that the Final Plan not
be approved.
v) Failure to Act. The failure of the Plan Commission to
act within such sixty (60) days, or such further time to
which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a
recommendation to the Board of Trustees to approve
the Final Plan as submitted.
6) Submittal to Appearance Review Commission. Prior to any
action being taken by the Board of Trustees pursuant to Section
16-13.4.e.7:
i) The Final Plan shall be submitted to the Appearance
Review Commission for review in accordance with the
provisions of Chapter 7 of the Libertyville Municipal
Code; and
ii) The recommendation of the Appearance Review
Commission shall be transmitted to the Board of
Trustees.
7) Action by Board of Trustees.
i) Approval or Denial. Within sixty (60) days after the
receipt of the recommendation of the Plan Commission,
or its failure to act as above provided, the Board of
Trustees shall either:
a) Approval Based on Substantial Conformity. If
the Plan Commission has recommended
approval of a Final Plan pursuant to Section 16-
13.4.e.5.ii, the Board of Trustees shall, unless it
specifically rejects one or more of the findings
of the Plan Commission on the basis of
expressly stated reasons, approve the Final Plan,
with or without modifications and conditions,
by a duly adopted ordinance; provided,
however, that if the proposed Final Plan did not
receive, or is not deemed by this Code to have
ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS, LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
356
received, a favorable recommendation of the
Plan Commission, such Final Plan shall not be
passed except by a majority vote of all the
Trustees then holding office; or
b) Approval Without Substantial Conformity. The
Board of Trustees may, if it finds that the Final
Plan merits approval and otherwise conforms to
the requirements of this Code, approve the Final
Plan, with or without modifications and
conditions, by a duly adopted ordinance;
provided, however, that if the proposed Final
Plan did not receive, or is not deemed by this
Code to have received, a favorable
recommendation of the Plan Commission, such
Final Plan shall not be passed except by a
majority vote of all the Trustees then holding
office; or
c) Denial. The Board of Trustees may, if it finds
that the Final Plan does not merit approval or
fails to conform to the requirements of this
Code, deny approval of the Final Plan.
ii) Referral Back to Plan Commission. In any case other
than that specified in Section 16-13.4.e.7.i.a the Board
of Trustees may refer the Final Plan back to the Plan
Commission for further consideration of specified
matters.
iii) Conditions on Final Plan Approval. The approval of
any Final Plan may be granted with or without
modifications and conditions to be accepted by the
applicant as a condition of approval; provided,
however, that in no event shall such conditions of
approval impair the rights granted by the Development
Concept Plan approval.
iv) Failure to Act. The failure of the Board of Trustees to
act within such sixty (60) days or such further time to
which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed to be a
decision denying Final Plan approval rendered on the
day following such period.
f. Final Plan Following Approval of Master Plan.
1) Purpose. The Final Plan is intended to particularize, refine,
and implement elements of the Master Plan and to serve as a
complete, thorough, and permanent public record of the

HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
357
planned development and the manner in which it is to be
developed.
2) Application. The applicant shall file an application for Final
Plan approval with respect to those elements of the planned
development as to which the applicant is seeking final
approval. Said application shall be made in accordance with
the requirements of Section 16-1 of this Code. The application
may include a request for approval of any element of
development within the approved Master Plan. The application

land subject to the Subdivision Code is proposed in connection
with a planned development, application for, review of and
approval of the final plat of the proposed subdivision shall be
carried out simultaneously with application for, review of and
approval of the Final Plan.
5) Submittal to Appearance Review Commission. Prior to any
action being taken by the Board of Trustees pursuant to Section

358
ii) The recommendation of the Appearance Review
Commission shall be transmitted to the Board of

6) Action by Board of Trustees.
i) Evaluation. Within sixty (60) days after the filing of an
application for approval of a Final Plan the Village
Board shall, with such aid and advice of the Village
staff and consultants as may be appropriate, review and
act on the plan. Such review shall consider:
a) whether the Final Plan is in substantial
conformity with the approved Master Plan;
b) the merit or lack of merit of any departure of the
Final Plan from substantial conformity with the
approved Master Plan;
c) whether the Final Plan complies with any and
all conditions imposed by approval of the
Master Plan; and
d) whether the Final Plan complies with the
provisions of this Code and all other applicable
Federal, State, and Village codes, ordinances,
and regulations.
ii) Approval or Denial. Following its evaluation, the
Board of Trustees shall either:
a) Approval Based on Substantial Conformity. If
the Board of trustees finds that the Final Plan is
in substantial conformity with the Master Plan,
the Board of Trustees shall approve the Final
Plan, with or without modifications and
conditions, by a duly adopted ordinance; or
b) Approval Without Substantial Conformity. If the
Board of Trustees finds that the Final Plan
merits approval and otherwise conforms to the
requirements of this Code but is not in
substantial conformity with the Master Plan, the
Board of Trustees may , approve the Final Plan,
with or without modifications and conditions,
by a duly adopted ordinance which shall not be
passed except by a majority vote of all of the
Trustees then holding office; or
LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS,
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
359
c) Denial. The Board of Trustees may, if it finds
that the Final Plan does not merit approval or
fails to conform to the requirements of this
Code, deny approval of the Final Plan.
iii) Referral Back to Plan Commission. In any case other
than that specified in Section 16-13.4.f.6.i.a, the Board
of Trustees may refer the Final Plan back to the Plan
Commission for further consideration of specified
matters.
iv) Conditions on Final Plan Approval. The approval of
any Final Plan may be granted with or without
modifications and conditions to be accepted by the
applicant as a condition of approval; provided,
however, that in no event shall such conditions of
approval impair the rights granted by the Master Plan
approval.
v) Failure to Act. The failure of the Board of Trustees to
act within one hundred and twenty (120) days following
the date of submission of the application for approval of
a Final Plan or such further time to which the applicant
may agree, shall be deemed to be a decision denying
Final Plan approval rendered on the day following such
period.
g. Recording of Final Plan. When a Final Plan is approved, the Village
Administrator shall cause the Final Plan, or such portions thereof as
are appropriate, to be recorded with the Recorder of Deeds of Lake
County.
h. Limitations on Final Plan Approval. Construction shall commence in
accordance with the approved Final Plan within one (1) year after the
approval of such Final Plan, or within such shorter time as may be
established by the approved development schedule. Failure to
commence construction within such period shall, unless an extension
of time shall have been granted by the Village Administrator pursuant
to Section 15-1.12 of this Code, automatically render void the Final
Plan approval and all approvals of the planned development and all
permits based on such approvals, and the Village Administrator shall,
without further direction, initiate an appropriate application to revoke
the special use permit for all portions of the planned development that
have not yet been completed.
i. Building and Other Permits. The approval of a Final Plan shall not
authorize the establishment or extension of any use nor the
development, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or moving of
ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS, LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
360
any building or structure, but shall merely authorize the preparation,
filing, and processing of applications for any permits or approvals that
may be required by the codes and ordinances of the Village. Except as
provided in this Section 16-13.4.i, appropriate officials of the Village
may upon, but not before, receiving notice from the Village
Administrator that the documents required for Final Plan approval
have been approved, and upon proper application by the applicant,
issue building and other permits to the applicant for the development,
construction, and other work in the area encompassed by the approved
Final Plan; provided, however, that no permit shall be issued unless
the appropriate official is first satisfied that the requirements of any
codes or ordinances of the Village that are applicable to the permit
sought, have been satisfied.
Building permits may, however, be withheld at the discretion of the
Village Administrator or the Board of Trustees at any time it is
determined that the development of the planned development is not
proceeding in strict compliance with the approved Final Plan.
16-13.5 Standards for Planned Development Approval.
a. Special Use Permit Standards. No special use permit for a planned
development shall be recommended or granted pursuant to this Section
16-13 unless the applicant shall establish that the proposed
development will meet each of the standards made applicable to
special permit uses pursuant to Section 16-9 of this Code.
b. Additional Standards for All Planned Developments. No special use
permit for a planned development shall be recommended or granted
unless the applicant shall establish that the proposed development will
meet each of the following additional standards:
1) Unified Ownership Required. The entire property proposed for
planned development treatment shall be in single ownership or
under such unified control as to ensure that the entire property
will be developed as a unified whole. All owners of the
property shall be included as joint applicants on all applications
and all approvals shall bind all owners. The violation of any
owner as to any lot shall be deemed a violation as to all owners
and all lots.
2) Minimum Area. The district regulations of this Code
establishing standards for particular types of planned
development specify the minimum area required for planned
developments (See Table 16-1). In addition to meeting that
specific standard, the applicant shall have the burden of
establishing that the subject property is of sufficient size and

shape to be planned and developed as a unified whole capable
of meeting the objectives for which planned developments may
be established pursuant to this Section 16-13.
3) Covenants and Restrictions to be Enforceable by Village. All
covenants, deed restrictions, easements, and similar restrictions
to be recorded in connection with the planned development
shall provide that they may not be modified, removed, or
released without the express consent of the Board of Trustees
and that they may be enforced by the Village as well as by
future landowners within the proposed development.
4) Public Open Space and Contributions. Whenever the Official
Comprehensive Plan or Official Map indicates that
development of a planned development will create a need for
land for public purposes within the proposed planned
development, the Board of Trustees may require that such area
be designated and, to the extent such need is specifically and
uniquely attributable to the proposed development, dedicated to
the Village or other appropriate government for such use. In
addition, the Board of Trustees may require evidence that all
requirements of Village ordinances pertaining to the
dedication of land or the contribution of cash in connection
with subdivisions or developments of land have been met as
respects the proposed planned development, whether or not
such proposed development would be otherwise subject to such
ordinances.
5) Common Open Space.
i) Amount, Location, and Use. The failure of a planned
development to provide common open space as
follows:
Amount of Open Space
Districts (Percent of Total Area)
All Residential 30
All Commercial, and Office 15
IB Institutional Buildings 20
All Industrial 10
shall be considered to be an indication that it has not
satisfied the objectives for which planned developments
may be approved pursuant to this Code. When common
open space is provided in a planned development, the
amount and location of such open space shall be
consistent with its intended function as set forth in the
application and planned development plans. No such
open space shall be used for the construction of any
LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS,
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
363
structure or improvement except such structures and
improvements as may be approved in the Final Plan as
appropriate to the intended leisure and recreational uses
for which such open space is intended.
ii) Preservation. Adequate safeguards, including recorded
covenants or dedication of development rights, shall be
provided to prevent the subsequent use of common
open space for any use, structure, improvement, or
development other than that shown on the approved
Final Plan. The restrictions must be permanent and not
for a given period of years and must run with the land.
iii) Ownership and Maintenance. The Final Plan shall
include such provisions for the ownership and
maintenance of common open space, including all
improvements thereto, as are reasonably necessary to
ensure their continuity, care, conservation,
maintenance, and operation in accordance with predetermined
standards and to ensure that remedial
measures will be available to the Village if such open
space or improvements are permitted to deteriorate or
are not maintained in a condition consistent with the
best interests of the planned development or the
Village.
iv) Property Owners Association. When the requirements
of Section 16-13.5.b.5.iii are to be satisfied by the
ownership or maintenance of such open space or
improvements by a property owners association, such
association shall meet each of the following standards:
a) the by-laws and rules of the association and all
declarations, covenants, and restrictions to be
recorded must be approved as part of the Final
Plan prior to becoming effective;
b) the by-laws and rules of the association and all
declarations, covenants, and restrictions to be
recorded shall each provide that it shall not be
amended without the prior written consent of
the Board of Trustees;
c) the association must be established and all
covenants and restrictions must be recorded
prior to the sale of any property within the area
of the planned development designated to have
use of the proposed open space or
improvements;
d) the association must be responsible for property
and liability insurance, taxes, and the
ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS, LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
364
maintenance of the open space and
improvements to be deeded to it;
e) membership in the association must be
mandatory for each property owner and any
successive owner having a right to the use,
enjoyment or benefit of such open space or
improvements;
f) every property owner having a right to the use,
enjoyment or benefit of such open space or
improvements must pay its pro rata share of the
cost of the association by means of an
assessment to be levied by the association that
meets the requirements for becoming a lien on
the property in accordance with statutes of the
State of Illinois;
g) the association must have the right to adjust the
assessment to meet changed needs by a
membership vote of not more than a majority of
the members voting on the issue;
h) the Village must be given the right to enforce
the declarations, covenants, and restrictions; and
i) the Village must be given the right, after ten
(10) days written notice to the association, to
perform any maintenance or repair work that the
association has neglected to perform, to assess
the membership for such work and to have a
lien against the property of any member failing
to pay such assessment and, for this purpose
alone, all the rights and powers of the
association and its governing body under the
agreements and declarations creating the
association.
v) Landscaping and Perimeter Treatment. Any area of a
planned development not used for structures or
circulation elements shall be landscaped. The perimeter
of the planned development shall be treated so as to
ensure compatibility with surrounding uses by means
such as provision of compatible uses and structures,
setbacks, screening, or natural or man-made buffers.
Every planned development shall provide a perimeter
landscaped open space along each of its boundaries;
each such open space shall have a minimum depth
equal to the minimum front yard required in the district
in which it is located or which it abuts, whichever is
greater.
LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS,
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
365
vi) Building Spacing. Building spacing shall be as
determined by the Board of Trustees; provided,
however, that no part of any building shall be closer to
any part of any other building than ten (10) feet.
vii) Private Streets. Private streets are prohibited unless
expressly approved by the Board of Trustees. If so
approved, they shall meet all construction and right-ofway
standards applicable to public streets. No such
streets shall be approved except upon the condition that
they shall be owned and maintained by a property
owners association meeting the requirements set forth
in Section 16-13.5.b.5.iv.
viii) Sidewalks. Unless expressly waived by the Board of
Trustees, a side-walk meeting the standards of the
Subdivision Code shall be provided along each side of
every street in or abutting a planned development.
ix) Utilities. All utility lines shall be installed
underground.
6) Vehicular Trip Reduction Features. Features for reducing the
number of vehicular trips expected by a development shall be
incorporated into a planned development. Such features
include, but are not limited to pedestrian/bicycle linkages
within and between land uses, the use of traffic mitigation
plans, and the incorporation of elements to encourage and
facilitate the use of public transportation.
c. Additional Standards for Specific Planned Developments. When the
district regulations authorizing any planned development use in a
particular district impose standards to be met by such planned
development in such district, a special permit for such development
shall not be recommended or granted unless the applicant shall
establish compliance with such special standards.
16-13.6 Conditions on Planned Development Approval. The approval of either a
Development Concept Plan or a Final Plan may be conditioned on such
matters as the Board of Trustees may find necessary to prevent or minimize
any possible adverse effects of the proposed planned development or to ensure
its compatibility with surrounding uses and development and its consistency
with the general purposes, goals, and objectives of this Code, the Subdivision
Code, and the Official Comprehensive Plan; provided, however, that no such
condition of Final Plan approval shall impair the rights granted by
Development Concept Plan approval. Such conditions shall be expressly set
forth in the ordinance granting the approval in question. Violation of any such
condition or limitation shall be a violation of this Code and shall constitute
grounds for revocation of all approvals granted for the planned development.
ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS, LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
366
16-13.7 Authority to Vary Regulations.
a. Authority. Subject to the standards and limitations hereinafter set
forth, the Board of Trustees shall have the authority, in connection
with the granting of any planned development approval pursuant to
this Section 16-13, to change, alter, vary, modify or waive any
provisions of this Code or of the Subdivision Code as they apply to an
approved planned development.
b. Standards. No such change, alteration, variation, modification, or
waiver shall be approved unless the Board of Trustees shall find that
the proposed planned development:
1) Will achieve the purposes for which planned developments
may be approved pursuant to Section 16-13.1 of this Code;
2) Will not violate the general purposes, goals, and objectives of
this Code and the Official Comprehensive Plan; and
3) Will result in a development providing compensating amenities
to the Village.
c. General Limitation. No such change, alteration, variation,
modification, or waiver shall be permitted with respect to the uses
permitted or specially permitted in any district or with respect to any
standard made specifically applicable to planned developments by the
regulations of any particular district unless such regulations expressly
authorize such a change, alteration, variation, modification, or waiver.
The limitations of this Section 16-13.7.c shall not apply when any such
change, alteration, variation, modification, or waiver would be
consistent with a previous approval of the Board of Trustees under an
ordinance duly adopted prior to the effective date of this Code in the
same or any earlier phase of the same development, all as determined
by the Board of Trustees.
d. Specific Limitations in the O-2 and IB Districts. In granting any
planned development approval pursuant to this Section 16-13, the
Board of Trustees shall not under any circumstances:
1) Increase the maximum floor area ratio applicable in any O-2
Office, Manufacturing and Distribution Park District to greater
than 1.0; or
2) Increase the maximum building height applicable in any O-2
Office, Manufacturing and Distribution Park District or any IB
Institutional Buildings District to greater than one hundred five
(105) feet.
LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS,
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
367
The limitations of this Section 16-13.7.d shall not apply when any
such change, alteration, variation, modification, or waiver would be
consistent with a previous approval of the Board of Trustees under an
ordinance duly adopted prior to the effective date of this Code in the
same or any earlier phase of the same development, all as determined
by the Board of Trustees.
16-13.8 Regulation During and Following Completion of Development. Following
Final Plan approval, no use, structure (other than accessory structures having a
floor area of less than five hundred (500) square feet, residential recreational
facilities and recreational devices), or development, other than home
occupations and temporary uses, not allowed by the Final Plan and the
ordinance approving the Final Plan shall be permitted within the area of the
planned development pursuant to the Zoning District regulations otherwise
applicable to such area. If the Final Plan and the ordinance approving the
Final Plan contain more or less restrictive regulations or impose higher or
lower standards or requirements than the regulations of this Code, then those
regulations, standards and requirements of the Final Plan and the ordinance
approving the Final Plan shall govern rather than the corresponding
regulation, standard or requirement of this Code.
16-13.9 Inspection During Development.
a. Inspections by Village Administrator. After approval of the Final Plan
of a planned development or any stage thereof, the Village
Administrator, at least annually until the completion of development,
shall review all permits issued and construction undertaken and
compare actual development with the approved plans for development
and with the approved development schedule.
b. Action by Village Administrator. If the Village Administrator finds
that development is not proceeding in accordance with the approved
schedule, or that it fails in any other respect to comply with the Final
Plan, the Village Administrator shall immediately notify the Board of
Trustees of such fact and may, if necessary to protect the public
health, safety, or welfare or to prevent further violation of this Code
and the Final Plan, issue an order stopping any and all work on the
planned development until such time as any noncompliance is cured.
c. Action by Board of Trustees. Within sixty (60) days after notification
by the Village Administrator, the Board of Trustees shall either:
1) take such steps as it deems necessary to compel compliance
with the Final Plan;
2) require the owner or applicant to seek an adjustment to the
Final Plan as provided in Section 16-13.10 of this Code; or
ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS, LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
368
3) revoke the Final Plan approval of all uncompleted portions of
the planned development, all prior plan approvals on which
such Final Plan approval depends, and all permits based upon
such approvals; in which event, the Village Administrator
shall, without further direction, initiate appropriate procedures
and actions to revoke the special use permit for all portions of
the planned development that have not yet been completed and
take such other action as may be appropriate to abate the
violation.
d. Failure to Act. Failure of the Board of Trustees to act within such
sixty (60) days shall, unless the owner or applicant shall have cured
the noncompliance within such period, be deemed a decision to revoke
the Final Plan as provided in Section 16-13.9.c.3 rendered on the day
following such period.
16-13.10 Adjustments to Final Plan During Development.
a. Minor Adjustments. During the development of a planned
development, the Village Administrator may authorize minor
adjustments to the Final Plan when such adjustments appear necessary
in light of technical or engineering considerations first discovered
during actual development. Such minor adjustments shall be limited
to the following:
1) Altering the location of any one structure or group of structures
by not more than ten (10) feet or one-fourth (1/4) of the
distance shown on the approved Final Plan between such
structure or structures and any other structure or any vehicular
circulation element or any boundary of the planned
development, whichever is less.
2) Altering the location of any circulation element by not more
than ten (10) feet or one-fourth (1/4) of the distance shown on
the approved Final Plan between such circulation element and
any structure, whichever is less.
3) Altering the location of any open space by not more than
twenty (20) feet.
4) Altering any final grade by not more than twenty percent
(20%) of the originally planned grade.
Any such minor adjustment approved pursuant to this Section 16-
13.10.a shall be consistent with the intent and purpose of this Code and
the Final Plan, as approved, shall be the minimum necessary to
overcome the particular difficulty, and shall not be approved if they
would result in a violation of any standard or requirement of this Code
or of the ordinance approving the planned development.
LIBERTYVILLE ZONING CODE ARTICLE 16 - ZONING APPLICATIONS,
HEARINGS, AND APPROVALS
369
b. Major Adjustments. Any adjustment to the Final Plan not authorized
by the preceding Section 16-13.10.a shall be considered to be a major
adjustment and shall be granted only upon application to, and approval
by, the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees may, by ordinance

PART F - AMENDMENTS -- OFFICIAL ZONING MAP AND TEXT
16-14 AMENDMENTS
16-14.1 Purpose. The amendment process established by this Section 16-14 is
intended to provide a means for making changes in the text of this Code and
in the Zoning Map that have more or less general significance or application.
It is not intended to relieve particular hardships nor to confer special
privileges or rights. Rather, it is intended as a tool to adjust the provisions of
this Code and the Zoning Map in light of changing, newly discovered or
newly important conditions, situations or knowledge.
16-14.2 Authority. This Code, including the Zoning Map, may be amended from
time to time by ordinance duly enacted by the Board of Trustees in
accordance with the procedures set out in this Section 16-14.
16-14.3 Parties Entitled to Seek Amendments. An application for an amendment
may be filed by the Board of Trustees, the Plan Commission, the Zoning
Board of Appeals, the owner of, or any person having a contractual interest in,
any property to be affected by a proposed amendment to the Zoning Map, or
any person interested in a proposed amendment to the text of this Code.
16-14.4 Procedure.
a. Pre-application Conference.
1) Request. In any case where a Zoning Map amendment is
requested pursuant to this Section 16-14, the applicant shall
request a pre-application conference with the Village
Administrator prior to filing his or her application.
2) Required Information. Prior to scheduling a pre-application
conference, the applicant shall provide required information to
the Village Administrator, including, but not limited to, a brief
and general description of the nature, location, and extent of
the proposed Zoning Map amendment.
3) Procedure. Upon receipt of all required information, the
Village Administrator shall promptly schedule such conference
and notify the applicant of the time and place of such
conference and of the names and affiliations of other persons
who have been invited to attend. The Village Administrator
shall conduct such conference, and its purpose shall be to
broadly acquaint all other parties with the proposals, views,
and concerns of all other parties at a time when positions are
still flexible and adjustment is still possible.

b. Application. Applications for amendments shall be filed in accordance
with the requirements of Section 16-1 of this Code; provided,
however, that amendments proposed by the Board of Trustees, the
Plan Commission, or the Zoning Board of Appeals shall not be subject
to said Section 16-1 but shall be transmitted to the Village
Administrator in such form as may seem appropriate to the initiating
body.
c. Public Hearing. A public hearing shall be set, noticed, and conducted
by the Plan Commission in accordance with Section 16-3 of this Code.
d. Action by Plan Commission. Within thirty-five (35) days after the
conclusion of the public hearing, the Plan Commission shall transmit
to the Board of Trustees its recommendation in the form specified by
Section 15-2.4. The failure of the Plan Commission to act within such
thirty-five (35) days, or such further time to which the applicant may
agree, shall be deemed a recommendation for the approval of the
proposed amendment as submitted.
e. Action by Board of Trustees; Protest. Within sixty (60) days after the
receipt of the recommendation of the Plan Commission, or its failure
to act as above provided, the Board of Trustees shall either deny the
application or, by ordinance duly adopted, adopt the proposed
amendment, with or without modifications; provided, however that no
amendment shall be granted within six (6) months after the effective
date of this Code or of any comprehensive amendment to this Code
unless such amendment is passed by a two-thirds vote of the Corporate
Authorities then holding office; and provided further, however, that in
the event a duly signed and acknowledged protest against a proposed
amendment: (i) is filed with the Village Clerk and (ii) a copy is served
on the applicant and the applicant's attorney, if any, by certified mail at
the address of such applicant and attorney shown in the application for
the proposed amendment, before the adoption of such amendment by
the owners of twenty percent (20%) or more of the frontage to be
affected by the proposed amendment, or by the owners of twenty
percent (20%) or more of the frontage immediately adjoining or across
an alley therefrom, or by the owners of twenty percent (20%) or more
of the frontage directly opposite the frontage to be affected, such
amendment shall not be passed except by a two-thirds vote of all the
Trustees then holding office.
The failure of the Board of Trustees to act within such sixty (60) days,
or such further time to which the applicant may agree, shall be deemed
to be a decision denying the application rendered on the day following
such period.

16-14.5 Standards for Amendments. The wisdom of amending the text of this Code
or the Zoning Map is a matter committed to the sound legislative discretion of
the Board of Trustees and is not dictated by any set standard. However, in
determining whether a proposed amendment should be granted or denied the
Board of Trustees should be guided by the principle that its power to amend
this Code is not an arbitrary one but one that may be exercised only when the
public good demands or requires the amendment to be made. In considering
whether that principle is satisfied in any particular case, the Board of Trustees
should weigh, among other factors, the following factors:
a. The consistency of the proposed amendment with the purposes of this
Code.
b. The existing uses and zoning classifications of properties in the
vicinity of the subject property.
c. The trend of development in the vicinity of the subject property,
including changes, if any, in such trend since the subject property was
placed in its present zoning classification.
d. The extent to which the value of the subject property is diminished by
its present zoning classification.
e. The extent to which such diminution in value is offset by an increase
in the public health, safety and welfare.
f. The extent, if any, to which the use and enjoyment of adjacent
properties would be adversely affected by the proposed amendment.
g. The extent, if any, to which the value of adjacent properties would be
adversely affected by the proposed amendment.
h. The extent, if any, to which the future orderly development of adjacent
properties would be adversely affected by the proposed amendment.
i. The suitability of the subject property for uses permitted or specially
permitted under its zoning classification.
j. The availability of adequate ingress to and egress from the subject
property and the extent to which traffic conditions in the immediate
vicinity of the subject property would be affected by the proposed
amendment.
k. The availability of adequate utilities and essential public services to
the subject property to accommodate the uses permitted or specially
permitted under its present and proposed zoning classification.
l. The length of time, if any, that the subject property has been vacant,
considered in the context of the pace of development in the vicinity of
the subject property.
m. The community need for the proposed amendment and for the uses and
development it would allow.

1
ILLINOIS, AS FOLLOWS:
SECTION ONE: Recitals. The foregoing recitals are hereby incorporated herein as if fully
set forth.
SECTION TWO: Determination as to Findings. The Village Board finds the following:
a. The consistency of the proposed amendment with the purposes of this Code. The proposed
amendment is consistent with the purpose of the Code.
b. The existing uses and zoning classifications of properties in the vicinity of the subject
property. The zoning classification of the property is currently 0-2 and will remain 0-2,
Office, Manufacturing and Distribution Park District. The existing uses and zoning
classifications of properties in the vicinity of the subject property are medical uses within the
0-2 District to the north, south, and east. The property to the west is zoned C-4, Shopping
Center Commercial District.
c. The trend of development in the vicinity of the subject property, including changes, if any, in
such trend since the subject property was placed in its present zoning classification. The
proposed site is currently developed with a medical building with various medical and dental
office type land uses. No change in the land use trend is anticipated.
d. The extent to which the value of the subject property is diminished by its present zoning
classification. The property will remain 0-2, Office, Manufacturing and Distribution Park
District. It is not anticipated that the value of the subject property will be diminished.
e. The extent to which such diminution in value is offset by an increase in the public health,
safety and welfare. The property will remain 0-2, Office, Manufacturing and Distribution
Park District. It is anticipated that the diminution in value of the subject property will be
affected positively by an increase in the public health, safety and welfare.
f. The extent, if any, to which the use and enjoyment of adjacent properties would be adversely
affected by the proposed amendment. The operation and land use of the ProHealth Pharmacy
at 1900 Hollister Drive in Libertyville will not be injurious to the uses and enjoyment of the
other properties in the immediate vicinity, nor substantially diminish or impair property
values within the neighboring area in which it is located.
g. The extent, if any, to which the value of adjacent properties would be adversely affected by
the proposed amendment. The operation and land use of the ProHealth Pharmacy at 1900
Hollister Drive in Libertyville will not be injurious to the uses and enjoyment of the other
properties in the immediate vicinity, nor substantially diminish or impair property values
within the neighboring area in which it is located.
h. The extent, if any, to which the future orderly development of adjacent properties would be
adversely affected by the proposed amendment. The pharmacy occupancy within the medical
building located at 1900 Hollister Drive will not adversely affect the orderly development of
the adjacent properties.
i. The suitability of the subject property for uses permitted or specially permitted under its
zoning classification. The property will remain zoned 0-2, Office, Manufacturing and
Distribution Park District. The subject property will continue to be suitable for uses
permitted and specially permitted under its zoning classification.
j. The availability of adequate ingress to and egressfrom the subject property and the extent to
which traffic conditions in the immediate vicinity of the subject property would be affected by
the proposed amendment. The proposed site will have access to Hollister Drive and
Milwaukee Avenue which will provide adequate ingress and egress from the subject property
and will have minimum impact on the overall traffic of the area.
k. The availability of adequate utilities and essential public services to the subject property to
accommodate the uses permitted or specially permitted under its present and proposed
zoning classification. Adequate utilities and essential public services to the subject property
are currently available to accommodate the pharmacy occupancy and all other current
occupants and future occupants that are permitted or specially permitted in 1900 Hollister
Drive which is located in the 0-2, Office, Manufacturing and Distribution Park District.
1. The length of time, if any, that the subject property has been vacant, considered in the
context of the pace of development in the vicinity of the subject property. The subject
property is not currently vacant.
m. The community need for the proposed amendment and for the uses and development it would
allow. The community need for the proposed Text Amendment is evidenced by medical land
