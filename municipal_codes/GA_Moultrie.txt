PREFACE 
    Part I of this volume contains the Charter and Related Laws of the City of Moultrie, Georgia, as amended, and a comparative table setting forth in chronological sequence the disposition of each act amending or relating to the Charter of the City, whether or not included in this publication. Part II contains a revision and codification of the ordinances, resolutions and motions of a general and permanent nature of the City of Moultrie, which were deemed appropriate to be included. 
    Part II is an entire new codification, and, as expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, supersedes all ordinances not included herein or expressly saved from repeal by the Adopting Ordinance. Only those ordinances, resolutions or motions of a general and permanent nature prescribed for and affecting the public as a whole are included herein. Special ordinances, resolutions or motions dealing with only a portion of the inhabitants of the City, rather than all of them, or relating to special purposes, such as those levying special assessments, providing for bond issues, paving, vacating and opening specified streets, rezoning certain designated districts, etc., are not included herein. For a more specific enumeration of the type of ordinances which are not included herein see Section 3 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The material in Part II, Code, has been classified as to subject matter. As will be noted, the chapters have been arranged conveniently in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been appropriately catchlined to facilitate usage. Attention is also invited to the footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which also refer to relevant provisions of general state law. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as chapter 12.5 or new chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

    In the construction of this Code and of all ordinances, the following rules shall be observed, unless such construction would be inconsistent with the manifest intent of the mayor and council:

    City manager. Whenever the term "manager" or "city manager" is used, it shall mean the city manager of the City of Moultrie. 
    Computation of time. Whenever a notice is required to be given or an act to be done a certain length of time before any proceeding shall be had, the day on which such notice is given or such act is done shall be counted in computing the time, but the day on which such proceeding is to be had shall not be counted.

In the interpretation and application of any provision of this Code, it shall be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare. Where any provision of this Code imposes greater restrictions upon the subject matter than the general provision imposed by the Code, the provision imposing the greater restriction or regulation shall be deemed to be controlling.

Sec. 2-146. - Plan amended and restated. 
    The City of Moultrie, Georgia (the "employer") established a retirement plan for employees of the City of Moultrie effective January 1, 1966 (the "plan") and the employer hereby amends and restates the plan effective January 1, 2015 through which will be provided retirement and other benefits to the city's employees through a trust fund established for that purpose. This plan is considered to be in the public interest in attracting and retaining better qualified personnel in the city's service and in providing greater personal security to its employees in their old age. This plan is intended to provide a governmental qualified defined benefit pension plan under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a) and 414(d). The benefits described in the plan are provided for the exclusive benefit of the participants and their beneficiaries. The plan shall be maintained at city hall. Certain provisions of this plan may be effective as of dates earlier or later than January 1, 2015, and shall be so designated. 
(Ord. No. 2010-90, § 1, 12-7-2010; Ord. No. 2016-177, § 1, 1-5-2016) 
Sec. 2-147. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Accrued benefit means the retirement income to which a participant will be entitled at his normal retirement age, based upon the actual number of years of service completed by the participant as of the date of determination and his compensation (if applicable) in those years of service. 
    Actuarial equivalent or actuarial equivalence means, with respect to a benefit calculated under this plan, any benefit that has the same present value on the date the benefit payment commences, using a seven percent interest rate per annum and the unisex mortality table in effect on the date benefits commence, as proscribed by the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service for purposes of Code Section 417(e)(3). Effective prior to January 1, 2010, the plan used a seven percent interest rate per annum and a 50 percent and 50 percent blend of the 1983 Group Annuity Table for males and females. 
    Authorized leave of absence means any temporary layoff or any absence authorized by the employer under the employer's standard personnel practices provided that all persons under similar circumstances must be treated alike in the granting of such authorized leaves of absence and provided further that the participant returns within the period of authorized absence. An absence due to service in the Armed Forces of the United States shall be considered an authorized leave of absence to the extent required by federal law. 
    Average monthly compensation means the average of the participant's compensation over the 36 consecutive months within the most recent ten-year period of service which produces the highest such average; provided however if an employee has not been employed continuously in service, his separate periods of service will be aggregated for purposes of this section as if he has been employed in service continuously during such aggregated period. If the employee's aggregated period of service is less than three years as of his date of termination of employment, his average monthly compensation will be determined as his average monthly compensation for his entire period of service. The following rules shall be applied to determine a participant's average monthly compensation: 
(1)  Only compensation earned or deemed to have been earned during a period for which the participant is receiving service or is an eligible employee may be counted towards average monthly compensation. 
(2)  Compensation shall be counted in the year paid, even if earned in a prior year. 
(3)  Only compensation earned or deemed to have been earned before January 1, 2018, may be counted towards average monthly compensation. No compensation earned on or after January 1, 2018, shall be taken into account in determining a participant's accrued benefit under the plan. 
    Beneficiary means any individual(s), trust, estate or other entity or entities designated by the participant in accordance with procedures established by the plan administrator to receive any death benefits under the plan. Any beneficiary designation shall be void if the participant revokes the designation. If a married participant fails to designate a beneficiary, or if the designated non-spouse primary beneficiary fails to survive the participant and the participant has not designated a contingent beneficiary, or if both the designated non-spouse primary beneficiary and contingent beneficiary fail to survive the participant, the beneficiary shall be (a) the participant's eligible spouse, or; (b) if no eligible spouse is alive, the participant's eligible dependent(s), or (c) if no eligible dependents, the participant's estate. If an unmarried participant fails to designate a beneficiary, or if the designated beneficiary fails to survive the participant and the participant has not designated a contingent beneficiary, or if both the designated beneficiary and contingent beneficiary fail to survive the participant, the beneficiary shall be the participant's eligible dependents, if any, and if none, the participant's estate. 
    For the purposes of this section, revocation of prior beneficiary designations will occur when a participant files a new valid designation with the plan administrator. 
    Nothing in this definition of beneficiary shall be interpreted to allow a participant to designate a beneficiary, or to be entitled to a death benefit, that is not otherwise provided under the terms of this plan. 
    Board means the board of trustees of the plan. 
    City means the City of Moultrie, Georgia.

    Except with respect to qualified participants (as defined below), in no event shall the compensation of a participant taken into account under the plan for any plan year exceed (i)$200,000.00 for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1989, (ii) $150,000.00 for plan years on or after the later of (a) January 1, 1996 or (b) the 90th day after the opening of the first legislative session that begins on or after January 1, 1996, or (iii) for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2002, the limitations of Code Section 401(a)(17) in effect as of the beginning of the plan year (i.e., $265,000.00 for 2015). For purposes of applying the $150,000.00 limit for the 1996 plan year, if any employee is the spouse or a lineal descendant of an employee (provided the lineal descendant is younger than age 19 by the end of the plan year) who is one of the ten "highly compensated employees" (within the meaning of Code Section 414(q)) paid the greatest amount of earnings (determined without regard to the $150,000.00 limit, as adjusted) during the plan year, the employee shall not be treated as a separate employee. 
    The limitations set forth in the preceding paragraph shall be subject to adjustment annually as provided in Code Section 401(a)(17)(B) and Code Section 415(d); provided, however, that the dollar increase in effect on January 1 of any calendar year, if any, is effective for the plan year.

A participant who elects early retirement is entitled to receive a monthly retirement income payable in the form described in section 2-151 beginning on his early retirement date.

The retirement income payable to a participant who elects early retirement shall be determined in the same manner as his normal retirement benefit calculated as described above, but reduced by zero and five-twelfths percent for each month by which the participant's early retirement date precedes his normal retirement date to take into account the participant's younger age and the earlier commencement of retirement income payments.

Notwithstanding section (b)(1) above, effective between September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2017 only, the retirement income payable to a participant who retires before his normal retirement age but on or after the age at which the sum of the participant's age plus his number of years of service equals 80 or more, shall be determined in the same manner as his normal retirement benefit calculated as described above, unreduced.

Such retirement shall be known as the participant's late retirement date and is payable in the form described in section 2-151. 
(2)  Amount of late retirement income. The retirement income payable to a participant who retires on his late retirement date shall be the sum of a., b. and c. defined below:

(3)  Actuarial adjustment. The actuarial adjustment will be determined as of the close of each plan year and will be equal to the increase in the participant's monthly retirement income as of the close of the preceding plan year (or the participant's normal retirement date, if later) which is required in order to provide a monthly benefit as of the determination date that is the actuarial equivalent of the monthly benefit as of the close of the preceding plan year (or the participant's normal retirement date, if later).

(1)  Ten year cliff vesting provision. A participant who terminates employment for any reason other than retirement but after completing ten years of service shall be entitled to the monthly retirement income equal to the normal retirement income earned by the participant determined in accordance with section 2-149(a) hereof but using the participant's compensation and service as of his termination of employment. Such benefit shall be referred to herein as a vested termination benefit and shall be payable in the form described in section 2-151. A participant who terminates employment with the employer for any reason other than retirement and before completing ten years of service shall not be entitled to receive any retirement income under this plan (other than a return of participant contributions as provided in (3) below).

a.  Commencement at normal retirement age. A vested terminated participant's retirement income shall commence as of his normal retirement date, unless the participant is eligible for and elects early commencement of his retirement income as provided in b. below.

A terminated participant generally may elect to convert his vested termination benefit into an early retirement income or late retirement income which is payable either before or after his normal retirement date, respectively, in accordance with section 2-149(b) and section 2-149(c), provided he has met any age or service requirement set forth therein. 
(3)  Return of contributions. If a participant has a termination of employment before earning at least ten years of service he shall receive a mandatory distribution of his participant contributions, plus interest. If such participant contributions plus interest are less than $5,000.00, they shall be returned to the participant in a single lump sum payment as of his termination of employment or as soon as practical thereafter. If such participant contributions plus interest are equal to or greater than $5,000.00, they shall be returned to the participant in a single lump sum payment as of the one-year anniversary of the participant's termination of employment or as soon as practical thereafter. If a participant has a termination of employment at least 15 years prior to his normal retirement age, the participant will receive a one-time election to receive an immediate lump sum distribution of his participant contributions, plus interest and forgo any other benefits under the plan, upon such termination of employment. Such distribution shall be made within 90 days of the termination of employment or as soon as practical thereafter. 
(4)  Forfeiture. Benefits under the plan may be reduced or forfeited to the extent permitted under O.C.G.A. §§ 47-1-20 through 47-1-25, if the participant is convicted of a public employment, drug related or other covered crime. 
(e)  Disability. A participant who terminates employment due to a disability, after completing ten years of service, shall receive a monthly retirement income equal to the normal retirement income determined as of his termination of employment beginning as of the first day of the month following his determination of disability.

(f)  Restoration of service. 
(1)  Reemployment before becoming vested. If a participant has a termination of employment before earning at least ten years of service and is rehired by an employer, his years of service attributable to the previous period of employment shall be ignored unless he repays within one year of rehire all participant contributions plus interest that he received from the plan. 
(2)  Reemployment after becoming vested. If a participant has a termination of employment after earning at least ten years of service and is rehired by an employer, his years of service attributable to the previous period of employment shall be restored unless prior to rehire, the participant received all amounts due under the plan. In such a case, if the participant repays the entire distribution plus interest to the plan within one year of rehire, all his years of service shall be restored.

If a participant's employment terminates on account of his death after he is eligible for a vested termination benefit, an early retirement income, normal retirement income or late retirement income, but before benefits have begun, his eligible spouse or eligible dependents(s) shall be eligible to receive a monthly retirement income known as a pre-retirement survivor annuity. A participant who attains at least age 55 prior to his death may make an election to have the pre-retirement survivor annuity paid to his or her beneficiary in an amount equal to the survivor portion of a 50 percent joint and survivor annuity, or the survivor portion of a 100 percent joint and survivor annuity. If a participant has made no such election prior to his death then the pre-retirement survivor annuity shall equal 50 percent of the monthly retirement income the participant would have received if he terminated employment the date before his death. Pre-retirement death benefits shall be payable as of the first day of each month coincident or next following the participant's date of death and shall be payable to the eligible spouse or to the eligible dependent(s) in equal shares to each eligible dependent. 
(b)  Return of participant contributions. If a participant dies before meeting the requirements of section 2-150(a) above, his designated beneficiary shall be entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to his participant contributions plus interest. 
(c)  Death after retirement. If a participant's employment terminates on account of his death after his retirement income has commenced in the normal form, the participant's designated beneficiary shall receive a benefit equal to the excess of any of the total participant contributions plus interest over the total payments made to the participant as of his date of death. If a participant's employment terminates on account of his death after his retirement income has commenced in an optional form, his beneficiary shall receive the benefits determined under the option selected. 
(Ord. No. 2010-90, § 5, 12-7-2010; Ord. No. 2014-142, § 3, 2-4-2014; Ord. No. 2016-177, § 5, 1-5-2016) 
Sec. 2-151. - Payment of benefits; optional forms of retirement income. 
(a)  Payment of retirement income. 
(1)  Monthly payments. The retirement income payable for normal, early or late retirement shall be payable on the first day of each month and shall begin on the normal, early or late retirement date as applicable; provided however, a participant will not be considered to have retired and will not be eligible to commence receipt of benefits of his early retirement income as long as he continues to be employed by the employer or if he is reemployed by the employer (prior to his normal retirement date) within 90 days of his termination of employment. 
(2)  Benefit commencement date. Normal, early or late retirement income payments shall not commence earlier that the first day of the month following the date on which the participant's complete application for a benefit is filed at the office of the plan administrator; provided however, payment must commence by the required beginning date. 
(3)  Death of participant before payments begin. If a participant dies before his retirement income payments are effective, no benefits shall be payable under the plan except as provided in section 2-150. 
(b)  Normal form of payment. The normal form of payment shall be a life annuity option, which is a monthly retirement income payable to the participant during the participant's lifetime, with payments ceasing upon the participant's death. All benefit formulas in this plan shall give the amount of the participant's retirement income if it is paid in the life annuity option, beginning at the participant's normal retirement date. 
(c)  Optional forms of payment. 
(1)  Optional forms available. A participant may elect to receive any of the optional forms of payment listed below, in lieu of the normal form of payment. The selection of an optional form of benefit shall be final and binding upon the participant and his beneficiary on the date the participant's retirement income commences, except as otherwise provided below. 
a.  One hundred and twenty months certain and life option. This is a reduced monthly retirement income equal to the actuarial equivalent of the life annuity option. The retirement income shall be payable to the participant during his lifetime and, in the event of the participant's death within a period of 120 months after the commencement of benefits, the same monthly amount shall be payable to the participant's beneficiary for the remainder of such 120 month period. 
b.  Joint and survivor annuity option. This is a reduced monthly retirement income equal to the actuarial equivalent of the life annuity option. The retirement income shall be payable to the participant for his life, and upon the participant's death, a designated percentage (100 percent, 66 ? percent, 50 percent as elected by the participant) of the participant's retirement income shall be payable to the participant's beneficiary for the beneficiary's life. Such retirement income shall cease on the later of the death of the participant or the death of the participant's beneficiary. 
c.  Death of beneficiary. If the participant's beneficiary or joint annuitant dies before the participant's retirement income begins, any optional form elected by the participant will be cancelled and the participant will receive retirement income in the normal form unless the participant makes a new election for an optional form with a new beneficiary or joint annuitant. 
d.  Social Security option. This is an increased monthly retirement income equal to the actuarial equivalent of the life annuity option. The retirement income shall be payable to the participant for his life until his social security benefits commence and a reduced retirement income payable thereafter for his life, so that combined social security benefits and retirement income payments are essentially level. 
e.  Death [of] the participant and beneficiary. If both the participant and the beneficiary die after the date the participant's retirement income payment becomes effective but before full payment has been made, any guaranteed payment shall be paid to a contingent beneficiary and if the commuted value of the remaining payments is less than $5,000.00, such payment shall automatically be made in a lump sum. 
(2)  Lump sum option. If the present value of the total amount due to the participant or beneficiary is $10,000.00 or less, the participant or beneficiary may elect to receive payment in a single lump sum payment. 
(3)  Minimum distribution incidental benefit rules. Any optional form of benefit elected by the participant must comply with the minimum distribution incidental benefit requirement of proposed Treasury Regulation § 1.401(a)(9)-2. This rule insures that the retirement benefits payable under the plan are more than incidental. 
(d)  Small lump sum payments. If the monthly amount of the total retirement income (including that of a pre-retirement survivor annuity or disability payment) to be paid is less than $100.00 per month as of the date the retirement income payments are first effective or as of the date of death of the participant, then the single sum actuarial equivalent of such retirement income shall be paid in a lump sum to the participant or beneficiary, as applicable without their consent. 
(e)  Special distribution rules (including age 701/2 rules). 
(1)  Commencement of distribution at normal retirement age. Payment of retirement income shall commence no later than the 60th day after the latest of the close of the plan year in which occurs: 
a.  The participant's 65 birthday; 
b.  The tenth anniversary of the date the participant commenced participation in this plan; or 
c.  The participant's termination of employment. 
(2)  Commencement at required beginning date. Notwithstanding (e)(1) above, distribution to a participant shall commence not later than the Required beginning date. The required beginning date shall be April 1 of the calendar year following the later of (i) the calendar year in which the participant attains age 701/2 or (ii) the calendar year in which the participant terminates employment. 
(3)  Effective date. The rules set forth in this section 2-151(e) shall apply for purposes of determining the required minimum distribution to participants and designated beneficiaries (as defined below) for calendar years beginning on and after January 1, 2003 even if, in the case of a designated beneficiary, the participant died before 2003. 
(4)  No extension of death benefits or payment forms. Nothing in this section 2-151(e) shall be deemed to extend any death benefit or permit any beneficiary designation or payment form not otherwise provided or permitted under this plan. This section 2-151(e) shall, instead, be deemed to limit and modify any provision of this plan to the extent that such limitation or modification is necessary to ensure that the plan complies with this section 2-151(e), Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations thereunder. 
    For purposes of this section 2-151(e), distributions are considered to begin on the participant's required beginning date. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the Participant before the participant's required beginning date, or to the participant's spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under section 2-151(e)(7)b below, the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(5)  Period of distribution. The entire interest of each participant in this plan will be distributed, beginning not later than the required beginning date described in paragraph (2) above, over the life of such participant or over the lives of such participant and his or her designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of such participant or the life expectancy of such participant and his or her designated beneficiary. 
(6)  Death of participant after distribution has begun. If distribution of a participant's interest has begun in accordance with paragraph (2) above (i.e., distributions on or after the required beginning date), and if the participant dies before his entire interest has been distributed to him, then the remaining portion of such interest will be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used under paragraph (2) as of the date of the participant's death. 
(7)  Death of participant before distribution has begun. If a participant dies before distribution of the participant's interest has begun in accordance with paragraph (2) above (i.e., no distributions have been made on or after the required beginning date), the entire interest of the participant must be paid over whichever of the following periods is applicable: 
a.  If one or more designated beneficiary(ies) is not the participant's spouse, the distribution period shall be the designated beneficiary's remaining life expectancy. 
b.  If the sole designated beneficiary is the participant's spouse, the distribution period shall be the spouse's remaining life expectancy. 
c.  If there is no designated beneficiary, the entire account shall be distributed by the end of the calendar year that includes the fifth anniversary of the participant's death. 
Distributions under this subsection (e)(7) shall commence as follows: 
i.  Distributions under 2-151(e)(7)(a.), (i.e., distribution to a non-spouse designated beneficiary) shall begin on or before the end of the calendar year that begins immediately after the calendar year in which the participant died. 
ii.  Distributions under section 2-151(e)(7)(b.) (i.e., distribution solely to a spousal designated beneficiary) shall begin on or before the later of the end of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died and the end of the calendar year in which the participant would have attained age 701/2. 
(8)  Form of distribution. For a participant who is employed by an employer after his required beginning date, any distribution payable under this section 2-151(e) may be paid in any optional form of benefit that is available under the plan, provided that all consent requirements under the plan are satisfied. Any form of distribution payable under this plan, however, must satisfy the following requirements: 
a.  The distribution must be in the form of a periodic annuity for the participant's life, or for the joint life expectancy of the participant and designated beneficiary or over a period certain that does not exceed the maximum length of the period certain determined under the regulations. 
b.  The interval between payments must be uniform over the entire distribution period and must not exceed one year. 
c.  If payments have commenced over a period certain, the period certain may not be changed. 
d.  Distributions in the form of a life annuity must satisfy the minimum distribution incidental benefit (MDIB) requirement of Code Section 401(a)(9)(G) and Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-6, A-1, or any successor regulation thereto. 
e.  All payments, either in the form of a life annuity or over a period certain must either be nonincreasing or increase only in accordance with the rules set forth in Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-6, A-1. 
f.  Unless the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with this section 2-151(e). If the participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations. 
    For purposes of this section 2-151(e), references to a life annuity shall include an annuity for the joint life expectancy of the participant and the designated beneficiary. 
(9)  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the participant's required beginning date (or, if the participant dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under subsection 2-151(e)(7)(a.) or (b.) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., bi-monthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually. All of the Participant's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the participant's required beginning date. 
(10)  Lump sum distributions. In the case of a lump sum distribution from this plan that is distributed in or after the calendar year in which the participant attains or would have attained age 701/2, the amount of the lump sum that equals the participant's or designated beneficiary's required minimum distribution and thus is not an eligible rollover distribution within the meaning of section 2-151(h) of the plan shall be determined using either of the methods set forth in the regulations. The plan administrator shall have the sole discretion to elect the calculation method but shall apply the same method to all lump sum distributions made in the same calendar year. 
(11)  Incidental death benefit requirement. Any optional form of benefit elected by the participant or designated beneficiary must comply with the minimum distribution incidental benefit requirement of Code Section 401(a)(9)(G). This rule insures that the retirement benefits payable under the plan are more than incidental. If the participant's interest is being distributed in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant and a non-spouse beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or after the participant's required beginning date to the designated beneficiary after the participant's death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for such period that would have been payable to the participant using the table set forth in Q&A-2 of Section 1.401(a)(9)-6 of the Treasury regulations. 
(12)  Actuarial increase after age 701/2. 
a.  A participant's accrued benefit shall be actuarially increased to take into account the period after age 701/2 in which the employee does not receive any benefits under the plan. The actuarial increase shall commence on April 1 following the calendar year in which the employee attains age 701/2, and end on the date on which benefits commence after retirement in an amount sufficient to satisfy Code Section 401(a)(9). 
The accrued benefit payable to such a participant as of the end of the period for which the actuarial increase is required shall not be less than: 
i.  The actuarial equivalent of the employee's accrued benefit as of April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant attained age 701/2, plus 
ii.  The actuarial equivalent of any additional benefits accrued after the date described in (i) above, less 
iii.  The actuarial equivalent of any distributions made with respect to the participant's accrued benefit after such date. 
b.  The actuarial increase described above may reduce the benefit accrual otherwise required under Code Section 411(b)(1)(H)(i). 
c.  The actuarial adjustment described above shall be made even during a period for which benefits are suspended pursuant to section 2-152. 
(13)  Plan administrator's discretion. The plan administrator shall have the sole authority and full discretion to apply the provisions of this section 2-151(e) to any benefit option elected by the participant. The plan administrator may, for example, modify a participant's selection of an optional form of benefit to satisfy the incidental death benefit requirement by requiring, at its discretion, that the participant select another form of benefit or another contingent annuitant, or by modifying the form of benefit so that it complies with the applicable rules. 
(14)  Definitions. The following definitions shall apply to this section 2-151(e) notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary. 
a.  Designated beneficiary. The term "designated beneficiary" shall be determined in accordance with the definition of "beneficiary" in the regulations, notwithstanding that this definition may be different from that set forth elsewhere in this plan, provided that any individual who is a designated beneficiary must also be a beneficiary (but not necessarily all of the Beneficiaries) as defined in this plan. Each Beneficiary, as defined in the plan, however, need not be a designated beneficiary in the event, for example, that a beneficiary disclaims his interest under this plan. 
b.  Spouse. "Spouse" shall mean "spouse" as defined in the regulations. Nothing in this section 2-151(e) shall be deemed, however, to extend any death benefit or permit any beneficiary designation or payment form not otherwise provided or permitted under this plan. 
c.  Regulations . "Regulations" shall refer to the Treasury Regulations (including temporary regulations) promulgated under Code Section 401(a)(9), as set forth in Treasury Regulations 1.401(a)(9)-1 through 1.401(a)(9)-6, and any additional guidance issued by the IRS in the form of revenue rulings, notices, other regulations and other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin or any successor thereto. 
d.  Distribution calendar year. "Distribution calendar year" is a calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year that contains the participant's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to subsection 2-151(e)(7)(i) and (ii). 
e.  Life expectancy. "Life expectancy" shall mean the period computed by the use of the single life table in section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the regulations. 
(f)  Small payments. Effective as to distributions that occur on and after January 1, 2006, if (i) the amount of a distribution is more than $1,000.00, and (ii) the participant does not affirmatively elect to receive the distribution directly or to have such distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan pursuant to section 2-151(h), then the plan administrator will pay the distribution in a direct rollover to an individual retirement plan designated by the plan administrator. 
(g)  Payment to minors and incapacitated persons. If any amount is payable to a minor or to any person who, in the judgment of the plan administrator, is incapable of making proper disposition thereof, such payment shall be made for the benefit of such minor or such person in any of the following ways as the plan administrator, in its sole discretion, shall determine: 
(1)  By payment to the legal representative of such minor or such person; 
(2)  By payment directly to such minor or such person; 
(3)  By payment in discharge of bills incurred by or for the benefit of such minor or such person. The board shall make such payments as directed by the plan administrator without the necessary intervention of any guardian or like fiduciary, and without any obligation to require bond or to see to the further application of such payment. Any payment so made shall be in complete discharge of the plan's obligation to the participant and his beneficiaries. 
(h)  Direct Rollover. 
(1)  Notwithstanding any provision of the plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the plan administrator, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions. 
a.  Eligible rollover distribution. An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include (i) any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; (ii) any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Code Section 401(a)(9); and (iii) for distributions before January 1, 2002, the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities.) The plan administrator may prohibit a distributee's election of a direct rollover with respect to an eligible rollover distribution during the plan year that is less than $200.00. If the distributee elects to have only a portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid to an eligible retirement plan, the plan administrator may require that portion to equal at least $500.00. 
b.  Eligible retirement plan. An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in Code Section 408(a), an individual retirement annuity described in Code Section 408(b), an annuity plan described in Code Section 403(a), a qualified trust described in Code Section 401(a), an annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b), and an eligible plan under Code Section 457(b) that is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state that agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan, provided that such account, annuity, contract, plan or trust accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. Effective as of January 1, 2008, eligible retirement plan shall include a Roth IRA established under Code Section 408A. 
c.  Distributee. A distributee includes an employee or former employee. In addition, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse who is an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Code Section 414(p), are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or former spouse. For distributions on and after January 1, 2007, "distributee" shall include a non-spouse beneficiary of an eligible rollover distribution to the extent permitted by Code Section 402(c)(11). 
d.  Direct rollover. A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
e.  Special rules for rollovers of after-tax contributions. To the extent that an eligible rollover distribution includes amounts that are not includible in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities), such an amount shall constitute an eligible rollover distribution to the extent that (i) it is transferred in a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to a qualified trust or to an annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b), and such trust or contract provides for separate accounting for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution that is not so includible, or (ii) such portion is transferred to an individual retirement account described in Code Section 408(a) or an individual retirement annuity described in Code Section 408(b) (other than an endowment contract). 
(Ord. No. 2010-90, § 6, 12-7-2010; Ord. No. 2011-105, § 1, 9-20-2011; Ord. No. 2016-177, § 6, 1-5-2016) 
Sec. 2-152. - Suspension of benefits. 
(a)  This section 2-152 shall apply to any participant who (i) retired or otherwise terminated employment under the provisions of this plan (ii) is receiving, has received, or was entitled to receive retirement income hereunder, and (iii) returns to employment with the employer. Such participant shall be subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  The participant shall not be entitled to receive during such period of reemployment any retirement income to which the participant might otherwise be entitled under this plan; provided, however, that retirement income for a given calendar month will not be suspended if the participant has attained his normal retirement age. 
(2)  The participant shall be treated like any other participant who terminated employment and was rehired (ignoring the fact that he may have retired and was receiving retirement income) and, to the extent provided in section 2-149(f), shall be given credit for service earned after reemployment and prior to his subsequent retirement. The period during which he was retired or was not employed by the employer shall not be included as service unless otherwise required by section 2-149(f). 
(3)  If the participant dies during the time of his reemployment and such participant has previously received retirement income, then any death benefit to which the participant's beneficiary shall be entitled shall be determined under the form of payment previously elected by the participant pursuant to section 2-151 and computed as described in subparagraph (4) below. If the participant had not previously received retirement income, then any death benefit shall be determined under section 2-150 of the plan (with the participant's accrued benefit first recomputed under subparagraph (4) below). 
(4)  The retirement income payable on the participant's subsequent termination of employment shall be made under the form of payment in effect (if any) prior to his reemployment and shall equal the greatest of a, b, or c below. 
a.  The retirement income payable to the participant shall be determined in accordance with section 2-149 based upon his compensation before his prior termination of employment and after his rehire (to the extent permitted under the definition of compensation) and by aggregating his service before his prior termination of employment with his service after his rehire. The retirement income so determined shall be reduced by the actuarial equivalent of any retirement income previously paid to the participant. 
b.  If the participant's subsequent termination of employment occurs after the participant's normal retirement date, the participant's monthly retirement income shall be adjusted in the manner described in section 2-149(c). 
c.  The monthly retirement income payable to the participant shall not be less than the monthly retirement income the participant was receiving or was entitled to receive prior to his earlier termination of employment. 
(Ord. No. 2010-90, § 7, 12-7-2010; Ord. No. 2016-177, § 7, 1-5-2016) 
Sec. 2-153. - Method of financing. 
(a)  Employer contributions. 
(1)  The employer shall contribute to the trust fund from time to time such amounts as the plan administrator shall determine, based upon the recommendations of an actuary, in order to fund the benefits provided hereunder on an actuarially sound basis. All employer contributions when made to the trust fund and all property and funds of the trust fund, including income from investments and from all other sources, shall be retained for the exclusive benefit of participants and beneficiaries and shall be used to pay retirement income provided hereunder or to pay expenses of administration of the plan and the trust fund. 
(2)  All contributions are conditioned upon the initial qualification of the plan under Code Section 401(a). Upon an employer's request and to the extent permitted by the Code and other applicable laws and regulations thereunder, a contribution shall be returned to the employer within one year after the denial of the plan's initial qualification. Upon an employer's request and to the extent permitted by the Code and other applicable laws and regulations thereunder, a contribution which was made by a mistake in fact shall be returned to the employer within one year after the payment of the contribution. 
(b)  Participant contributions. 
(1)  Each participant shall contribute three and one-half percent of compensation until January 31, 2005, and four and two-tenths percent thereafter. 
(2)  Effective January 1, 2002, the participant contributions described in this section, although designated as participant contributions, are being paid by the employer as "pick-up" contributions in accordance with Code Section 414(h). As such, these contributions are mandatory and no participant is entitled under any circumstances to receive such contributions in cash in lieu of having them contributed to the plan. Such contributions shall be 100 percent vested for all purposes under the plan. 
(3)  Effective on and after January 1, 2018, no participant contributions shall be made to the plan. 
(c)  Miscellaneous. 
(1)  Any actuarial gains arising from actuarial experience under the plan shall be used to reduce the employer contributions and will not be used to increase any benefits payable under this plan. No forfeiture arising from severance of employment, death or for any other reason, shall be applied to increase the benefits any participant would otherwise receive under the plan at any time prior to the termination of the plan or the complete discontinuance of employer contributions hereunder, but all amounts so forfeited shall be used as soon as possible to reduce the employer contributions under the plan. 
(2)  No person shall have any interest in or right to the fund or any part thereof except as expressly provided in the plan. 
(Ord. No. 2010-90, § 8, 12-7-2010; Ord. No. 2016-177, § 8, 1-5-2016; Ord. No. 2017-190, § 5, 10-17-2017) 
Sec. 2-154. - Plan termination. 
(a)  The employer expects this plan to be continued indefinitely but reserves the right to terminate the plan and its contributions hereunder at any time by action of city council. In the event that it becomes necessary to terminate or partially terminate the plan, then the accrued benefit of each affected participant (within the meaning of Code Section 411(d)(3)), to the extent funded, shall become fully vested and non-forfeitable as of the date of such termination or partial termination in the manner hereinafter provided in this section 2-154. 
(b)  If the employer elects to terminate the plan, the city council shall give written notice of such fact to the board of trustees and the plan administrator for the plan. Thereafter the board and the plan administrator shall prepare a list of all participants showing for each, as of the date of plan termination, the following: 
(1)  The amount and payment terms of all benefits currently being paid to each participant, beneficiary and joint annuitant; 
(2)  The amount, payments terms and commencement date of benefits for terminated participants entitled to benefits under the plan; and, 
(3)  The accrued benefit of each active participant. 
(c)  The board shall prepare a statement of the liquidated value of the assets held in the trust fund. The employer, in its sole discretion may request the board to arrange for the liquidation of all plan assets and may direct the board to purchase fully paid-up annuity contracts to provide the benefits to which each participant, beneficiary and joint annuitant is entitled or to pay a lump sum to each such participant, beneficiary and joint annuitant equal to the actuarial equivalent of the retirement benefits to which each is entitled. 
(d)  If the plan assets are not sufficient to provide full benefits to each participant, beneficiary and joint annuitant, the employer shall pay to the board, as soon as practical an amount equal to the total value of benefits payable over the total value of assets held in the trust. 
(e)  Any residual assets of the plan remaining after distribution in accordance with the preceding paragraphs shall be distributed to the employer, provided: 
(1)  All liabilities of the plan to participants and beneficiaries have been satisfied; and 
(2)  The distribution does not contravene any provision of applicable law. 
(Ord. No. 2010-90, § 8, 12-7-2010; Ord. No. 2016-177, § 9, 1-5-2016) 
Sec. 2-155. - Administration of the plan. 
(a)  Named fiduciaries. 
(1)  The following parties are named as fiduciaries of the plan to the extent that they are charged with the operation and administration of the plan: 
a.  The governing authority of the employer; 
b.  The board of trustees; and 
c.  The plan administrator.

The participant may make-up all or a portion of any required participant contributions and shall receive the amount of service that is directly proportionate to the percentage of participant contributions that are made-up. The participant shall designate the plan year to which such contributions relate. The employer shall grant Service based on the made-up participant contributions in the time and manner as such service is accrued by active participants. Such make-up participant contributions can be paid to the plan in a lump sum, in installments or by payroll deduction. 
3.  Death during military service. If a participant dies during a period of qualified military service, the participant shall be treated as having returned to employment with the employer on the day before his death and died the next day for purposes of any survivor benefits including pre-retirement survivor benefits and any accelerated vesting. Such participant shall receive service for vesting purposes for the period of qualified military service. 
4.  Compensation. For purposes of this section, a participant's compensation during the period of qualified military service shall be treated as equivalent to the compensation he or she would have received during such period but for the period of qualified military service. Such determination shall be based on the rate of pay the employee would have received during that time; provided however if the compensation the employee would have received is not reasonably certain, compensation for this purpose shall equal the employee's average compensation during the 12-month period immediately preceding the qualified military service (or, if shorter, the period of employment immediately preceding the qualified military service). 
5.  Differential wage payments. If the employer pays differential wage payments to the participant while on qualified military leave, such payments shall be treated as compensation under the plan for purposes of benefits and for purposes of Code Section 415 and Section 4.7 of the plan. 
(e)  Elections by participants. As prescribed by the plan administrator, elections or notifications by participants under this plan may be made either in writing or by electronic means. 
(f)  Release. Any payment to a participant or beneficiary, or to their legal representatives, in accordance with the provisions of this plan, shall to the extent thereof be in full satisfaction of all claims hereunder against the board, plan administrator and the employer, any of whom may require such participant, beneficiary, or legal representative, as a condition precedent to such payment, to execute a receipt and release therefor in such form as shall be determined by the board, the plan administrator, or the employer, as the case may be. 
(g)  Complaint with applicable laws. The employer, through the board and plan administrator, shall interpret and administer the plan in such manner that the plan shall remain in compliance with the Code, laws of the State of Georgia, and all other applicable laws, regulations, and rulings. 
(h)  Merger. In the event of any merger or consolidation of the plan with any other plan, or the transfer of assets or liabilities by the plan to another plan, each participant must receive (assuming that the plan would terminate) the benefit immediately after the merger, consolidation, or transfer which is equal to or greater than the benefit such participant would have been entitled to receive immediately before the merger, consolidation, or transfer (assuming that the plan had then terminated). 
(i)  Governing law. The plan shall be governed by the laws of the State of Georgia, without regard to its conflicts of laws principles, to the extent that such laws are not preempted by federal law. 
(j)  Location of participant or beneficiary unknown. In the event that all or any portion of the distribution payable to a participant or his beneficiary shall remain unpaid solely by reason of the plan administrator's inability to ascertain the whereabouts of such participant or beneficiary, the amount unpaid shall be forfeited. However, such forfeiture shall not occur until five years after the amount first became payable. The plan administrator shall make a diligent effort to locate the participant or beneficiary including the mailing of a registered letter, return receipt requested, to the last known address of such participant or beneficiary. In the event a participant or beneficiary is located subsequent to his benefit being forfeited, such benefit shall be restored and distributed. 
(k)  Use of electronic communication. 
(1)  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, where this plan or the plan administrator requires that communications regarding the plan from a participant or beneficiary be made in writing to the employer or any other entity, such communications may be made in any means prescribed by the plan administrator. The plan administrator shall designate acceptable means of communication by distributing (or directing the distribution of) instructions, personal identification numbers, telephone numbers, website addresses or similar information that will enable the participant or beneficiary to use such alternate means of communication. Where the plan administrator does not prescribe an alternate means of communication, such communications must be made in writing and delivered to the plan administrator via hand delivery or mail. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the plan administrator may prescribe that certain types of communications shall be made exclusively by telephone or electronically. In such a case, the plan administrator may not accept the written communication, or may delay the acceptance or implementation of the communication, as it deems appropriate. 
(2)  The plan administrator may communicate with the employees, participants and beneficiaries concerning this plan using such electronic means as it deems appropriate, provided that such use is, in the judgment of the plan administrator, consistent with the Code. 
(l)  Participant obligation to advise of mailing address. 
(1)  Each participant and, in the case of a deceased participant, his beneficiary, shall keep the plan administrator apprised of his current mailing address. Any notice from the participant or beneficiary changing his mailing address shall be in writing and directed to the individual, position or department within the plan administrator that is responsible for maintaining records regarding the plan and its participants. Any such notice shall include sufficient information from which the plan Administrator can verify the identity of the participant or beneficiary who provided the notice. If the plan administrator receives a change of address request and believes that it may not have been made by or on behalf of the participant or beneficiary, the plan administrator shall take reasonable steps to verify the address. If the plan administrator cannot verify the address or the identity of the individual who submitted the address change, it shall take any steps it deems necessary or appropriate to ensure to protect the participant or beneficiary and the plan. 
2.  Any notice sent by the plan administrator to the participant's or beneficiary's mailing address, as such address is reflected on the plan administrator's records, shall be deemed to have been provided to the participant or beneficiary, as applicable, regardless of whether it is actually received. Nothing in this paragraph 2-159(l) shall be deemed to relieve the plan administrator of any obligation to use a good faith effort to contact a participant or beneficiary or to contradict the procedures set forth in Section 2-159(j), "location of participant or beneficiary unknown."

    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, state law and the Charter of the city shall be controlling in the event of an actual conflict with the provisions of this code of ethics. This article shall be interpreted to supplement, and not replace, said provisions of state law and the Charter.

ARTICLE II. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS 

Sec. 10-26. - Findings; public purpose. 
(a)  Based on the experience of other local governmental jurisdictions recognizing that the sale and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages in adult entertainment establishments produces increased criminal activity and deterioration of adjacent neighborhoods, the mayor and council of the city find that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to enact regulations to reduce the possible adverse impacts of adult entertainment establishments. However, the mayor and council also find that the outright prohibition of such establishments could improperly infringe upon protected forms of expression. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to reasonably regulate adult entertainment establishments in a manner that serves the legitimate governmental interest of reducing criminal activity and protecting property values without unreasonably infringing upon the protected rights of adult entertainment establishments and their patrons. 
(b)  The mayor and council has again reviewed and considered problems that other communities have experienced as a result of adult entertainment establishments operating within those jurisdictions. Included in these materials were various studies conducted by local governments on the adult entertainment issue. Reviewed by the council were studies of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Houston, Texas; and a summary of land use studies by various municipalities including but not limited to Garden Grove, California; Tucson, Arizona; Seattle, Washington; and Indianapolis, Indiana. Also reviewed were a copy of a transcript of a hearing before the Peach County Commissioners held on May 7, 1996; the article "Regulation of Adult Entertainment in Georgia: Dancing in a Mine Field" by Susan S. Cole under date of June 14, 1996; a copy of the minutes of a meeting of the city council of the City of Fort Myers, Florida, on November 22, 1993; newspaper stories relating to establishments in or near Marietta, Georgia; and recent review and passage of an ordinance by the City of Thomasville, Georgia. After such review and a public hearing on the subject, each individual member of the council is of the opinion that this article is in the best interest of the citizens of the community in an effort to avoid harmful and secondary effects known to occur in and around these types of businesses. The mayor and council, in reaffirming this article, has no intention to infringe upon the rights of any citizens to freedom of speech or expression.

Before the city council shall revoke or suspend any existing license, the applicant shall be given notice in writing from the city clerk to show cause before the city council at a time and place specified therein, not less than three days nor more than ten days from the date of service of the notice, why the license should not be revoked or suspended, as the case may be, stating the grounds therefore, and at the appointed time and place the licensee shall have the opportunity to show cause, if any exists, why the application should not be denied or the license revoked or suspended, after which the city council shall take such action as it, in its judgment and discretion, shall deem warranted under the facts, including suspension, probation, or revocation, and/or may impose a civil monetary penalty not to exceed the amount allowed under the city charter. The hearing herein provided for need not be at a regular meeting of the city council, but may be at such time and place as shall be fixed in the notice. All decisions suspending or revoking any license shall be in writing, with the reason therefore stated, and mailed or delivered to the applicant.

Formal rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings under this section, although the mayor and council shall have the right to exclude evidence which carries no indicia of reliability. All testimony shall be offered under oath or affirmation. 
(2)  Due cause generally. The term "due cause" for the purposes of this section shall include, but not be limited to: 
a.  Conviction of, or the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by, the licensee or any of his employees or any person holding an interest in the license for any felony, any law, administrative regulation or ordinance involving alcoholic beverages, gambling or narcotics, or tax laws. 
b.  Conviction of, or the entering of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere by, the licensee or any of his employees or any person holding an interest in the license for any sex offense when the business is licensed for on-premises consumption. 
c.  Suspension or revocation of any state license required as a condition for the possession, sale or distribution of alcoholic beverages. 
d.  Revelation of any material falsification of any fact or representation given in an application for a license issued under this chapter or bearing upon the licensee's qualification therefor. Any material omission from, or untrue or misleading information which is contained in, an original, or renewal application for license hereunder shall be cause for the denial or refusal of a license, and if any license has previously been granted under such circumstances, the same shall constitute due cause for suspension or revocation of such license. Any act which may be construed as a subterfuge in an effort to circumvent any of the qualifications for a license under this chapter shall be deemed a violation of the requirement attempted to be circumvented. 
e.  Failure to meet or maintain any standard prescribed by this article as a condition or qualification for holding a license. 
f.  Due cause may also be found should the licensed establishment have become a trouble spot in the judgment of the council by reason of disturbances or acts of disorderly conduct or violence having occurred in the business or on the premises thereof; provided that when the license of any establishment has been revoked or renewal of license denied because the establishment has become a trouble spot, no further license shall be issued under this chapter to any person at the location for a period of at least 12 months from the date of revocation. 
g.  Due cause shall also consist of the business or the operation or location thereof of the owner or any person connected therewith ceasing to meet any of the qualifications for the issuance of license as stated in this chapter. 
h.  Failure to control operation resulting in public nuisance. If the failure to control the operation either inside the building or outside on the property results in controlled substance abuse, prostitution, gambling, flagrant indecent conduct or obscenity, fighting, excessive noise, loitering or illegal parking, to the number of times and extent that the city council, should find the establishment to have become a public nuisance, then such failure may be declared to be due cause for suspension or revocation of the license for such establishment, or the denial of renewal application for same. 
i.  Any other factor known to or discovered by the city whereby it is objectively shown the licensee, any of the licensee's employees or any person holding an interest in a license, has engaged in conduct at or involving the licensed business or has permitted conduct on the licensed premises that constitutes a violation of federal or state law, a violation of any law or ordinance regulating such business, or violation of regulations made pursuant to authority granted for the purpose of regulating such business, local ordinance or administrative regulations involving alcoholic beverages, gambling or narcotics for all alcohol licensed businesses and including any sex offense under state law or local ordinances with respect to businesses licensed for on-premises consumption, and of failure of the licensee or his employee to promptly report to the police department any violation of the law or ordinances, breach of peace, disturbance or altercation resulting in violence occurring inside the building or on the premises. With respect to this section, it shall be rebuttably presumed that the violative act was done with the knowledge or consent of the licensee; provided, however, that such presumption may be rebutted only by evidence which precludes every other reasonable hypothesis save that such licensee did not know, assist or aid in such occurrence, or in the exercise of full diligence that such licensee could not have discovered or prevented such activity. 
j.  Emergency due cause; failure or refusal to cooperate with police acting in line of duty. On evidence of failure or refusal of the licensee or any employee hereunder to cooperate with any police officer on any reasonable request or action within such officer's duties, responsibilities or powers, including all police powers, rights and duties to investigate to determine any pertinent fact relating to the establishment, the licensee, any employees or corporate officers or partners, the city manager or his designee shall immediately order all operation of any bona fide coin operated amusement machine discontinued until after a hearing is set out in the due cause hearing provided for in subsection (d)(1) of this section, such hearing to be concerning such failure or refusal to cooperate. 
(e)  Notice of suspension or revocation proceedings shall be served on the person named as licensee in the application and shall be in writing. The notice may be served personally or by first class mail. If by mail, the notice shall be addressed to the licensee at its address as provided by the licensee to the municipality. The burden shall be on the licensee to provide notice, in writing, of any change of address for service of notices and process. In the case of service by mail of any notice required by this chapter, the service is complete at the time of deposit in the United States Postal Service. 
(f)  Sanctions generally. Mayor and council may impose any such sanction(s), or no sanctions, in its judgment and discretion. Such sanction(s) may include one or more of the following: revocation of the license, suspension of the license for no more than 12 months, imposition of a probationary period not to exceed 12 months, and/or a civil monetary penalty not to exceed the amount allowed under the city charter. Where the remaining term of the license is less than 12 months, imposition of suspension or probation for a period in excess of the term of the existing license shall be applied to any license renewal. A subsequent violation within a probationary period shall be cause for revocation and/or denial of license renewal. A total of three separate and unrelated violations within 24 months, whether or not within a probationary period, shall be grounds for permanent revocation. 
(g)  Upon receipt of notice of adverse action against the licensee under this section, the licensee may waive its right to a hearing and stipulate to a sanction, as recommended by the city manager, in consultation with the chief of police. Any stipulation entered under this subsection shall be in writing, signed by the licensee, and non-appealable.

(2)  A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
(5)  The local issuing authority may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in paragraph (c) subsections 15. and 16. herein, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
(c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b) and published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in paragraph (b), subsection (2) of this article; 
(15)  Except as provided in paragraph (16) below, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term 'ephemeral stream' means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the groundwater table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
(d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c) above. 
(e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
(Ord. No. 2010-69, § 4, 1-5-2010) 
Sec. 46-30. - Application/permit process. 
(a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
(b)  Application requirements. 
(1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city without first obtaining a permit from the city to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
(2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the city and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c) below. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 46-29(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by four copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
(3)  A fee, in accordance with the city schedule of fees shall be charged for each acre or fraction thereof in the project area. 
(4)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(5)(a), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
(5)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsections 46-29(c)(15) and (16) of this article have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(7) below have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
(6)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this article or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
(7)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
(c)  Plan requirements. 
(1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 46-29(b) and (c) of this article, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices.

(Ord. No. 2010-69, § 5, 1-5-2010) 
Sec. 46-31. - Inspection and enforcement. 
(a)  The city will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion, sedimentation and pollution Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
(b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975.

ARTICLE IV. - WETLANDS PROTECTION 

Sec. 46-81. - Findings and purpose. 
(a)  Findings of fact. The wetlands within Moultrie, Georgia are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soils limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife, and vegetation; water quality maintenance and population control; flood control; erosion control; natural resource education; scientific study; open space; and recreational opportunities. In addition, the wise management of forested wetlands is essential to the economic well-being of many communities within the State of Georgia. 
    Nationally, a considerable number of these important natural resources have been lost or impaired by draining, dredging, filling, excavating, building, pollution, and other acts. Piecemeal or cumulative losses will, over time, destroy additional wetlands. Damaging or destroying wetlands threatens public safety and the general welfare. 
    The Georgia Department of Natural Resources and the Georgia Department of Community Affairs have determined that each local government with classified wetlands located in its jurisdiction must adopt a Wetlands Protection Ordinance under the requirements of House Bill 215, Georgia's 1989 Growth Strategies Legislation and the rules promulgated thereunder. 
    It is therefore necessary for Moultrie, Georgia to ensure maximum protection for wetlands by discouraging development activities in wetlands that may adversely affect wetlands. 
(b)  Title and purpose. This article shall be known as the Wetland Protection Ordinance of Moultrie, Georgia. The purposes of this article is to promote wise use of wetlands and protect wetlands, while taking into account varying ecological, economic development, recreational, and aesthetic values. Activities which may damage wetlands should be located on upland sites to the greatest degree practicable as determined by a permitting process. The objective of this article is to protect wetlands from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce their primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, ground water recharge, aesthetic nature, and wildlife areas and to comply with the requirements of state law related to wetland protection. 
(Ord. No. 812, § 1, 6-1-1999) 
Sec. 46-82. - Definitions.

    Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
    Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this chapter, the term is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD). 
    North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain and has replaced the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 in existing and future FEMA Modernization Maps. 
    New construction means any structure (see definition) for which the start of construction commenced after August 2, 1977 and includes any subsequent improvements to the structure (i.e., the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance adopted by the community as a basis for community participation in the National Flood Insurance Program). 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after August 2, 1977 (i.e., the effective date of the first floodplain management regulations adopted by a community).

(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Start of construction means the date the development permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: Accessory structures are not exempt from any chapter requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
    Subdivision means the division of a single lot into two or more lots for the purpose of sale or development. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a building, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building should be (i) the appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (ii) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions, which have been preidentified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project. 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

(Ord. No. 761, art. 1, § A, 9-2-1997) 
Sec. 54-3. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood relief and protection, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the occupancy in flood hazard areas of uses vulnerable to floods, which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages, and by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities. 
(Ord. No. 761, art. 1, § B, 9-2-1997) 
Sec. 54-4. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(2)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion; 
(3)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 
(4)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 
(5)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters. 
(Ord. No. 761, art. 1, § C, 9-2-1997)

Sec. 54-14. - Variance procedures. 
(a)  The Moultrie-Colquitt County Planning Commission as established by the city council shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this chapter. 
(b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Moultrie-Colquitt County Planning Commission may appeal such decision to the superior court of the county, as provided in state law. 
(d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this section are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(g)  In reviewing such requests, the Moultrie-Colquitt County Planning Commission shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this and other sections of this chapter. 
(h)  Conditions for variances are as follow: 
(1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(2)  The provisions of this chapter are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore, any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  The city engineer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.

a.  Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
1.  Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
2.  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 
3.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both directions. 
b.  So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this chapter, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 
c.  The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms. 
(5)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components, all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 
(6)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include but are not limited to use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state requirements for resisting wind forces; 
(7)  New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
(8)  New and replacement sanitary sewer systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters; 
(9)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
(10)  Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure which is not compliant with the provisions of this chapter shall be undertaken only if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced. 
(Ord. No. 761, art. 4, § A, 9-2-1997) 
Sec. 54-72. - Specific standards. 
    In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required: 
(1)  New construction and substantial improvements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than two feet above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 54-71(4) pertaining to elevated buildings. All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood elevation. 
(2)  Nonresidential construction. New construction or the substantial improvement of any structure located in A1-30, AE, or AH zone may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed to be watertight to two feet above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 54-43(7). 
(3)  Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
a.  All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved (i) on individual lots or parcels, (ii) in new or substantially improved manufactured home parks or subdivisions, (iii) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions, or (iv) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision where a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than two feet above the base flood elevation. 
b.  Manufactured homes placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision may be elevated so that either: 
1.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower than two feet above the level of the base flood elevation; or 
2.  The manufactured home chassis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
c.  All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement (refer to subsection 54-71(6) above). 
d.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
1.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached structures or additions) and be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or 
2.  The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new construction, including the anchoring and elevation requirements of subsections 54-72(3)a. through (3)c., above. 
(4)  Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 54-7 are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following shall apply: 
a.  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway. Development may be permitted, however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof. 
b.  Only if subsection (4)a of this section is satisfied, then any new construction or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this article. 
(Ord. No. 761, art. 4, § B, 9-2-1997; Ord. No. 2009-63, § 5, 8-18-2009; Ord. No. 2010-70, § 1, 1-19-2010) 
Sec. 54-73. - Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A-zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 54-7, where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A zones), or where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following apply: 
(1)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with section 54-7, the city engineer shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this article. Only if data are not available from these sources, then subsections (2) and (3) of this section shall apply. 
(2)  No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(3)  In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing structures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 54-71(4) pertaining to elevated buildings. The city engineer shall certify the lowest floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file. 
(4)  All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site.

    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Business building means any structure, whether public or private, that is adapted for occupancy for transaction of business; for rendering of professional service; for amusement; for the display, sale or storage of goods, wares and merchandise; or for the performance of work or labor, including hotels, roominghouses, office buildings, public buildings, stores, theaters, markets, grain elevators, abattoirs, warehouses, workshops, factories, and all outhouses, sheds, barns, and other structures or premises used for business purposes. 
    City health officer means the health officer of the joint city-county board of health, or by any duly authorized person who may represent him. 
    Occupant means the individual, partnership or corporation that has the use of or occupies any business building or a part or fraction thereof, whether the actual owner or tenant. In the case of a vacant building or any portion of a business building, the owner, agent or other person having custody of the building shall have the responsibilities of an occupant of a building. 
    Owner means the actual owner of the business building, whether individual, partnership or corporation, or the agent of the building or other person having custody of the building or to whom rent is paid. In the case of business buildings leased with a clause in the lease specifying that the lessee will be considered in such cases as the owner, he is so considered for the purpose of this division. 
    Rat harborage means any condition which provides shelter or protection for rats, thus favoring their multiplication and continued existence in, under or outside a structure of any kind. 
    Vent stoppage applies to a relatively inexpensive form of ratproofing to prevent the ingress of rats into business buildings, from the exterior or from one business building to another as illustrated in part by booklet entitled "Marine Typhus Fever" as published by the state department of public health. It consists essentially of the closing of all openings in the exterior walls, ground or first floors, basements, roofs, and foundations, that may be reached by rats from the ground, by climbing, or by burrowing, with material impervious to rat gnawing.

In certain instances, per the judgment of the public works department, commercial customers may be required to bag, bundle, or size their garbage before placing in a suitable container. Containers shall be maintained at all times with tight-fitting lids or covers provided the container was supplied with a lid or cover. Containers shall be secured in such a manner as to prevent the overturning by the elements or by dogs or other animals.

The public works department shall have final determination whether any replacement is due to normal wear-and-tear, damage, abuse, or theft.

The dumpster shall be the normal commercial garbage container used for larger volume commercial customers and where, in the opinion of the public works department, such a container shall be more practical than 96-gallon roll-away containers.

A commercial customer may use a maximum of four 96-gallon roll-away containers before being required to use a dumpster unless, in the opinion of the public works department, a customer shall be better served by 96-gallon roll-away containers. 
(4)  Container location.

Any commercial customer having their dumpster blocked by an obstruction which prevents collection at their normally scheduled time and which requires another trip to complete the collection or who requests an extra collection beyond their normal collection schedule shall be billed a fee pursuant to the service fee schedule maintained by the city. 
(b)  Commercial special handling. Slaughterhouses, fish houses, veterinarians, or any other commercial establishments which require special handling of garbage for reasons such as daily roll-away collection or collection of dead animals weighing more than 100 pounds shall be billed a collection charge of landfill disposal costs, plus equipment, labor, and overhead costs; however, the collection charge shall not be less than the minimum commercial refuse rate.

(a)  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under section 110-330 of this article. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of sections 110-326, 110-328 and 110-329 of this article. 
(b)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (a) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(c)  In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the city manager, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(d)  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(e)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

Sec. 110-456. - Notification of violation. 
    When the city manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within ten days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the city manager. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city manager to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.

DIVISION 15. - AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS 

Sec. 110-551. - Upset. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section, the term "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance or careless or improper operation. 
(b)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of subsection (c) of this section are met. 
(c)  An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence, that: 
(1)  An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause of the upset. 
(2)  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures. 
(3)  The industrial user has submitted the following information to the POTW and treatment plant operator within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five working days): 
a.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance. 
b.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue. 
c.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(d)  In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
(e)  Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
(f)  The industrial user shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
(Code 1967, § 27-262; Ord. No. 723, § 1, 8-20-1996) 
Sec. 110-552. - General/specific prohibitions. 
    An industrial user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in section 110-111 of this article if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1)  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the industrial user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
(2)  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(Code 1967, § 27-263; Ord. No. 723, § 1, 8-20-1996) 
Sec. 110-553. - Bypass. 
(a)  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of an industrial user's treatment facility. 
    Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b)  An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c), (d) and (e) of this section. 
(c)  If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the POTW, at least ten days before the date of the bypass if possible. 
(d)  An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the POTW within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The POTW may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(e)  Bypass is prohibited, and the POTW may take enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless: 
(1)  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage; 
(2)  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment equipment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
(3)  The industrial user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section. 
(f)  The POTW may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the POTW determines that if will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (e) of this section.

(a)  For the purpose of this section, the term "slug" means the intentional discharge at a flow rate of concentration which could cause a violation of the prohibited discharge standards in section 110-111 of this article. 
(b)  A user shall submit oral notice to the city manager of an unanticipated slug that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of any slug. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of any slug loadings which would create a fire or explosion hazard; corrosive structural damage to the sewer lines or the treatment plant; solid or viscous pollutant, including oxygen-demanding pollutants released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which will cause interference; heat which will inhibit biological activity; petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin in amounts that will cause interference or pass through; pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapor or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems. The written submission shall contain a description of the slug and its cause, the duration of the slug, including exact dates and times. The city manager may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(c)  Slug loadings are prohibited, and the city manager may take an enforcement action against a user for a slug loading.

Sec. 110-674. - Characteristics determining charge. 
(a)  The wastewater characteristics which are used to determine user charge are (i) BOD, (ii) suspended solids, (iii) flow volume and (iv) grease. Normal wastewater discharges and industrial wastewater discharges of normal strength wastewaters shall be charged a basic user charge in which flow volume is the wastewater characteristic for determining the charge. When BOD, suspended solids, or grease concentrations in a user's wastewater discharge is in excess of the range of concentration in normal strength wastewater, a surcharge shall be made to the base charge. 
(b)  The formula for determining basic user charge which applies to normal strength discharges shall be as follows: 
R = Vm Ct 
Where: 
R = Monthly user charge Vm = Monthly volume contribution from a user in 1,000-gallon units Ct = Basic unit charge to user (dollar per 1,000 gallons for operation and maintenance)  
(c)  When BOD, suspended solids and grease exceed the range of concentration of those pollutants in normal strength wastewater, a surcharge shall be added to the basic charge. The surcharge shall be determined as follows: 
Cs = 0.000692 (Bc × B + Sc × S + Gc × G) Vu 
Where: 
Cs = Surcharge for wastewater (dollars per month) Bc = Operation and maintenance costs for treatment of a pound of BOD B = Concentration of BOD from a user above base load (mg/l) Sc = Operation and maintenance costs for treatment of a pound of suspended solids S = Concentration of suspended solids from a user above base level (mg/l) Gc = Operation and maintenance cost for treatment of a pound of grease G = Concentration of grease from a user above base level (mg/l) Vu = Flow volume in units of 1,000 gallons per year  
(d)  Unit value determination. 
(1)  The basic unit Ct, which shall be revised biennially, shall be determined as follows: 
Ct = (Bd Bc + Sd Sc + Gd Gc + Vt) 
Where: 
Ct = As defined in subsection (b) of this section B = Average pounds of BOD per 1,000 gallons of normal strength wastewater contributed Sd = Average pounds of suspended solids per 1,000 gallons of normal strength wastewater contributed. Sc = As defined in subsection (c) of this section Gd = Average pounds of grease per 1,000 gallons of normal strength wastewater contributed. Gc = As defined in subsection (c) of this section Vt = The operation and maintenance costs for transportation and treatment of 1000 gallons of wastewater.  
(2)  Bd, Sd and Gd shall be revised not less frequently than biannually and shall be determined by dividing actual wastewater treatment plant loading less total surcharged loading by total annual volume contribution by domestic wastewater dischargers. 
(3)  Bc, Sc and Gc shall be revised not less often than two years by dividing their respective annual maintenance and operation costs by their respective annual loadings. 
(4)  Wastewater monitoring and reporting shall be as described in division 6 of this article. 
(5)  Wastewater discharge volume (Vm) for dischargers of normal strength wastewater shall be 100 percent of the amount of water metered. For industrial wastewater dischargers which discharge surcharged waste the wastewater discharge volume (Vu) shall be 80 percent of the amount of water metered unless it can be shown that the volume of wastewater discharge is less.

The city will only compensate the customer generator for avoided energy kWh's as determined by metered energy delivered to the city's distribution system. 
c.  Any energy which is generated in excess of the customer generator's load at any time shall be purchased by the city at its avoided energy cost. The avoided energy cost will be computed by the city based upon the average monthly wholesale market price as determined by the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG Power), the city's wholesale energy provider. 
(9)  Credit balances: In the event the customer generator develops a credit balance during a billing period, the amount will remain as a credit on the customer generator's account. Credit balances remaining at the end of the city's fiscal year will be cleared by the issuance of a check for the credit balance to the customer generator. Any other clearance of account credit balances will be at the city's discretion. 
(10)  Late payment charge: Said rates are applicable and payable monthly within ten days from the date the bill is mailed. An additional a ten percent shall be assessed on all bills not paid within ten days from the date the bill is mailed.

(7)  Metering and billing method: The city may install either single or bi-directional metering equipment depending upon the design and purpose of the installation to measure the kilowatt demand delivered by the city and to measure the net kilowatt-hours purchased by the customer generator or delivered to the city. The customer generator's net bill will be calculated using the city's calculation for avoided energy cost credited to the customer generator, netted against the monthly billing period charges for the customer generator's regular service based upon actual metered energy. 
(8)  Energy created in excess of customer load: 
a.  When electricity supplied by the city exceeds the electricity generated by the customer generator's distributed generation system, the electricity shall be billed by the city in accordance with its then applicable rate. 
b.  When electricity generated by the customer generator's distributed generation system exceeds the electricity supplied by the city, the customer shall be billed for the customer charges described in the standard rate for that billing period and credited for excess kWh generated during the billing period at the city's avoided energy cost. The city will only compensate the customer generator for avoided energy kWh's as determined by metered energy delivered to the city's distribution system. 
c.  Any energy which is generated in excess of the customer generator's load at any time shall be purchased by the city at its avoided energy cost.

Sec. 110-759. - Distribution of funds. 
    Revenues in the revenue fund shall be disposed of in the following manner and order: 
(1)  Operation, maintenance and repair. There shall first be paid from said revenue fund the reasonable and necessary cost of operating, maintaining and repairing the gas system, including salaries, wages, cost of material and supplies, expendable equipment, cathodic protection and inspection, cost of gas purchased, rentals of leased property, insurance, engineering, legal and accountants' fees for services rendered, compensation and expenses of the paying agent and of the depositories and custodian of funds established hereunder, and such other charges as may properly be made for the purpose of operating, maintaining and repairing said system in accordance with sound business practice. 
(2)  Sinking fund. There shall also be reserved in said revenue fund, as working capital for the above-stated purposes, an amount estimated to be required to pay such cost for the next three succeeding months, beginning on the first day of the next succeeding month, and such monies shall be so set aside or reserved for that purpose, and all the remaining unallocated monies in said revenue fund shall be paid into a special fund, which is hereby created and designated as the "Gas System Sinking Fund," hereinafter sometimes called the sinking fund, on the last day of each month, unless the last day of said month should fall on a Sunday or holiday, in which event it shall be paid on the next succeeding business day, such payments into said fund to continue and recontinue for so long a time as is necessary to have in said fund an amount sufficient to pay the principal of and interest requirements on the certificates for the current sinking fund year, and in addition, to create and maintain a reserve in said fund in an amount equal to the maximum amount payable during any sinking fund year while the certificates are outstanding as principal of and interest on the certificates. After said reserve in said fund has been accumulated in its full amount required to be maintained therein as aforesaid, the money then to be paid monthly from the revenue fund into said sinking fund, except as hereinafter provided, shall be one-sixth of the interest payable on the certificates on the next ensuing interest payment date and 1/12 of the principal of the certificates payable on the next certificate maturity date coming due in the next succeeding sinking fund year. If in any month, for any reason, the full amount required hereunder shall not be paid into the sinking fund, any deficiency shall be added to the amount required to be paid into said sinking fund in the next succeeding month. After the reserve in said sinking fund shall have been accumulated in the full amount required to be maintained therein as aforesaid, it shall be maintained for the purpose of paying principal and interest falling due in any year as to which there would otherwise be a default, and if money is taken from the reserve in said fund for the payment of such principal or interest, the money so taken shall be replaced in said fund from the first monies in the revenue fund thereafter available and not required to be used for maintenance and operation charges. 
(3)  Reserve fund. After there has been paid from the revenue fund in each sinking fund year all amounts hereinabove required to be made, the remaining available monies in the revenue fund, except the working capital provided for above, shall be paid at the end of each month into a special fund to be known and hereby created as "Renewal and Extension Reserve Fund," sometimes hereinafter called the reserve fund, and the payments into said reserve fund shall continue and recontinue until such time as there shall be in said fund an amount equal to six percent of the aggregate principal amount of the certificates authorized to be issued under the bond issue ordinance. Thereafter, payments need be made into said reserve fund only for the purpose of reimbursing money withdrawn or expended therefrom in which event such monthly payments as above stipulated to be made shall immediately recommence until all monies withdrawn or expended therefrom have been repaid. Expenditures shall be made from the said reserve fund only for the purpose of: 
a.  In case of an emergency having a major effect upon the gas system caused by some extraordinary occurrence and which makes it necessary to use funds of the gas system for the alleviation or removal of such effects, and an insufficiency of money exists in the revenue fund to meet such emergency; 
b.  Making replacements, additions, extensions and improvements deemed by the governing body of the city reasonable and necessary and to the best interest of the city and the certificate holders; or 
c.  Paying principal of and interest on the certificates falling due at any time for the payment of which money is not available in the sinking fund. 
The mayor and council shall first obtain the consulting engineer's recommendation and approval with reference to expenditures to be made from said reserve fund, except in the case of payment therefrom for maturing principal and interest when other monies are not available for that purpose. 
(4)  Extra funds. Whenever and so long as the amount of the reserve in the sinking fund equals the amount required to be maintained therein as aforesaid and the amount in the reserve fund equals the amount required to be maintained in said fund as aforesaid, 50 percent of the remaining revenues in the revenue fund, after setting apart in said revenue fund the reserve for working capital as aforesaid and after the monthly payments into the sinking fund of one-sixth of the interest payable on the certificates on the next ensuing interest payment date and 1/12 of the principal of the certificates payable on the next certificate maturity date coming due in the next succeeding sinking fund year, and after setting apart in said revenue fund a further reserve in an amount which, when added to the gross revenues and income reasonably expected to be derived from the system during the then ensuing six-month period, shall be sufficient to make all payments into the sinking fund during said six-month period, shall be paid at the end of each month into the sinking fund and the money so paid in said sinking fund shall be used for sinking fund purposes in calling or acquiring certificates prior to maturity as provided in article II of the bond issue ordinance, and the balance of said remaining revenues may be disposed of by the council as the council may from time to time determine to be for the best interests of the city.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2009-61, §§ 1-11, adopted July 7, 2009, amended Art. II in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. II, §§ 114-26-114-38, pertained to similar subject matter. See the Code Comparative Table for complete derivation. 

Sec. 114-26. - Purpose and intent. 
    Community trees provide many environmental, social, and economic benefits. In addition to the aesthetic value of trees, they protect the environment and improve health by reducing carbon dioxide and introducing oxygen into the air. Furthermore, trees reduce soil erosion due to storm water runoff, conserve energy by providing shade, and serve as protective buffers between varying zoning classifications, as well as provide benefits to property values, business revenues, scenic quality, urban design, human health and well-being, outdoor recreation, and wildlife. Therefore, the purpose of this ordinance is to sustain and enhance the functions and benefits of trees and the community forest for the citizens of Moultrie, Georgia and to utilize trees for all of their positive aspects. 
    It is hereby declared that trees within the city are both an economic and aesthetic asset to the city. The fostering of positive public attitudes toward the value of trees and green space to the community warrants directed public education efforts. It is further declared that existing trees are in need of protection and qualified maintenance, and that measures should be undertaken to promote the planting of additional trees.

    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Boundary tree means any tree that has any part of its trunk located on two or more properties or property lines other than property of the City of Moultrie or rights-of-way. Ownership of, and responsibility for, a boundary tree shall be shared equally by the owners of all properties upon which any portion of its trunk grows. Trees with branches encroaching on a property with items other than a trunk, i.e.: limbs, leaves, fruit, etc. are not considered boundary trees. 
    Buildable area means that portion of a site that development may or does occur. 
    Caliper means the diameter or thickness of the main stem of a young tree or sapling as measured at six inches above ground level. This measurement is used for nursery-grown trees. 
    City of Moultrie Tree means any tree whose trunk is growing wholly or partially on land owned by City of Moultrie, including, but not limited to, public street rights-of-way, parks, and building and facility yards. 
    Clearing means the removal of a tree that has a diameter of four inches or greater measured at the height of six inches above the ground. 
    Critical root zone means a more or less circular area above and extending 24 inches below the ground around the trunk of a tree with a radius equivalent to the distance to the drip line, or one and one-quarter feet for every one inch in diameter-at-breast height (DBH), whichever is greater. The critical root zone increases in size as a tree grows larger and serves as the tree protection zone. 
    Diameter-at-breast height (DBH) means a standard measurement of tree size and is a tree trunk diameter measured in inches at a height of 54 inches above the ground. If a tree splits into multiple trunks below 54 inches, the trunk is measured at its most narrow point beneath the split. Measurements of one-half-inch or more are rounded to the higher DBH. 
    Drip line means a line extending down to the ground from the greatest horizontal extent of a tree's branches, more or less forming a cylinder around the tree. 
    Exceptional tree means any tree determined by the tree committee, as provided for herein, to be of notable historic interest, high aesthetic value or of unique character because of species, type, age, location, or size. 
    Imminently dangerous tree means a tree that shows extensive signs of insects or disease, infections, wounds or other mechanical damage, decay, or structural defects; an unhealthy tree that may pose a threat to property and/or safety. 
    Ownership of any tree shall be determined by the location of its trunk. If the entire trunk is located solely on one property, the property owner(s) shall be deemed the owner(s) of the tree. 
    Re-planting means the replacement of trees to meet the minimum requirements of this article. 
    Scaffolding branches means the large main limbs that diverge from the trunk of a tree and support the remainder of the branches and leaves. 
    Shade tree means a large or medium tree with a crown size and shape that will typically provide significant shade and beneficial effects on temperature, air quality, water quality, and other environmental conditions, at maturity. Synonymous with "canopy tree." 
    Structural defects means defects to a tree and may include, but are not limited to: severed or damaged roots greater than two inches in diameter within the critical root zone; signs of previous topping or other improper pruning practices resulting in decay or a structural defect; longitudinal cracks in the trunk; wounds that encompass greater than one-third of the circumference of the trunk; trunk cavities equal to or greater than two-thirds of the trunk diameter at the point of the cavity; cracks, wounds, or cavities of one or more of the scaffold limbs resulting in a structural defect that cannot be corrected to ensure a safe or healthy condition; and any other defect that cannot be corrected through standard arboricultural practices. 
    Tree means any wooded plant that has a single trunk with a diameter of four inches or greater when measured at a point six inches above the ground and which normally obtains a height of at least ten feet at maturity. 
    Tree bank means a monetary fund, written agreement, or other approved activity, as deemed appropriate by the committee, used for tree plantings or tree replacements throughout the city. The tree bank should be utilized for mitigation plans when necessary. 
    Tree stand means a contiguous grouping of trees. 
    Unhealthy tree means a tree demonstrating one or more signs of loss of vigor and decline, as indicated by atypical leaf color, recurring short annual shoot extension, or severe insect or disease infestation, or with damage or structural defects.

(Ord. No. 2009-61, § 3, 7-7-2009) 
Sec. 114-29. - Cutting, trimming or removing trees; application required; actions by tree committee. 
(a)  Except as otherwise provided, no person shall cut, remove, trim or in any way damage any City of Moultrie Tree or shall create any condition injurious to any such tree without having first made a written application to the committee and having obtained advance written permission from the committee. The committee shall take action on the application within 45 days of its receipt. The form of application shall be established from time to time by the committee, and the committee may delegate to one or more of its members or officers the power to grant such permission in accordance with standards set by it. The committee may, in its discretion, hold public hearings on any application and may approve all or any part of an application upon such terms and conditions as the committee may fix. In considering any application before it, the committee shall base its decision on whether the public and private benefit that will result from granting the application outweighs the public and private benefit that will result from denying it. 
(b)  The city shall have the right to cause the removal of any dead or diseased trees on private property within the city, when such trees constitute a hazard to safety and property, or harbor insects or disease which constitutes a potential threat to other trees within the city. The tree committee shall notify in writing the owners of such trees. Removal shall be done by said owners at their own expense within 60 days after the date of service of notice. Owners will be afforded a hearing before the committee prior to removal, if the owners so desire. Failure to act within the 60-day period shall prompt further action by the committee in accordance with section 114-37. 
(c)  When any tree is encroaching on city property or rights-of-way and it is determined that more than fifty (50) percent of it's diameter-at-breast height (DBH), as determined by the City of Moultrie Engineering Department or a licensed engineer or surveyor, is located on property not owned by the city, the city shall have the right to cause the removal of said tree(s). The tree committee shall notify in writing the owner(s) of such tree(s) and removal shall be done by said owner(s) at their own expense within 60 days after the date of service of notice. Owners will be afforded a hearing before the committee prior to removal, if the owner(s) request same in writing within 15 days of notification. Failure to request a hearing within the time required or to act within the 60-day period shall subject the owner(s) to the penalties contained in subsection 114-37(c). 
(d)  Any tree determined to have more than fifty (50) percent of its diameter-at-breast height (DBH), as determined by the City of Moultrie Engineering Department or a licensed engineer or surveyor, located on property not owned by the city, shall be cut, trimmed or removed by said owner(s) at their own expense and any and all maintenance to said tree shall be the responsibility of its owner(s). 
(e)  Except as otherwise provided herein, no boundary tree shall be removed unless and until all owners have signed an agreement for the removal and sharing the cost. The owners may split the cost and pay for the removal or one owner may reimburse the other. Regardless, no removal or maintenance of the tree is deemed the responsibility of one party over the other. If a boundary tree becomes diseased or dies, any owner thereof may have the tree removed over objection from the remaining owner(s). In the case of a diseased or dead boundary tree the owner who opts for the removal is the responsible party for payment, but may submit a bill to the other property owner(s) or seek reimbursement for their pro rata share as determined by the number of property owners of the boundary tree. 
(f)  Subsection 114-29(a) shall not apply to local power, cable and telephone companies, and their agents, or when other emergency situations with respect to the maintenance of utility rights-of-way exist. However, these agencies should follow procedures and tree maintenance techniques in accordance with the American National Standard for Tree Care Operations A300 dated June 1, 1995. A copy of which is available at the planning and community development department. 
(Ord. No. 2009-61, § 4, 7-7-2009; Ord. No. 2011-106, §§ 3-6, 10-18-2011) 
Sec. 114-30. - City departments granted emergency powers. 
    Departments of the city are granted emergency powers with respect to cutting, trimming, or removing trees in order to restore the delivery of city services following service interruptions. Departments of the city are granted emergency powers with respect to cutting, trimming, or removing dead or imminently dangerous trees.

(Ord. No. 2009-61, § 5, 7-7-2009) 
Sec. 114-31. - Procedure for land clearing or land disturbance permits. 
(a)  Before any land clearing or land disturbing activities can begin on any parcel of land (excluding one- and two-family dwellings), the land owner or an authorized agent must make application for an erosion and sediment control plan review, along with the notice of intent as required by the State of Georgia Environmental Protection Division. A copy of the application and the state-required fee for local governments should be turned into the planning and community development department.

(Ord. No. 2009-61, § 6, 7-7-2009) 
Sec. 114-32. - Tree replacement and removal for new developments and redevelopments greater than 50 percent. 
(a)  All new development and redevelopment of property shall have a number of trees equivalent to 15 tree units per acre of development site. (Not including land area covered by buildings.) All properties less than one acre shall have a minimum number of trees equivalent to seven units. Where trees must be added to achieve the required 15 tree units per acre of development site one species may not comprise more than 25 percent of the required units. Where existing pines already comprise 50 percent or more of the required units any additional pines planted will not be credited toward the required tree units per acre. 
    Example: A 19-inch DBH tree has a tree density equaled to two units. Four two-inch caliper replacement trees at .5 per tree would also equal two tree density units. Therefore, a tree that has a DBH of 19 inches would be replaced with four replacement trees that have a two-inch caliper. 
(b)  The committee shall direct replacement with suitable trees in suitable locations on property of the city in those situations where trees have been removed. City of Moultrie Suggested List of Shade Quality Trees is a list of trees approved and adopted by the Moultrie Tree Committee that includes tree species approved for planting(s) throughout the City of Moultrie to satisfy the requirements of this chapter. Said list shall be on file in the planning and community development department. 
(c)  Prior to any new development and redevelopment of property an application must be filed with and approved by the committee or their designee in writing. 
(d)  The provisions of this section shall not apply to one- and two-family dwellings.

* This definition applies to the land uses in any particular zoning district which have a legal right to remain if they were being used prior to the adoption of the Zoning Ordinance, since zoning cannot be made retroactive. For example: A NON-CONFORMING USE would be a grocery store located in a single family residential zoning district that does not apply to permit commercial uses, or a home located in a industrial zoning that does not permit residences. This definition does not apply to building or structure which is permitted in a particular zoning district but which does not meet the Zoning Ordinance requirements for building height, yard setbacks, off-street parking space or other regulations.
Likewise, a NON-CONFORMING USE is not an open air land use, such as a parking lot outside storage use, which may not meet the zoning district requirements for greenbelts or fencing, even though such an open air land use is permitted forthwith in the particular zoning district.
To further clarify the definition of a NON-CONFORMING USE a building, which has a deficient front yard, but is a use of land permitted in the zoning district wherein it is located, is not a NON-CONFORMING USE but rather a conforming use with a deficient front yard. However, should this building be expanded in the future, the new addition would have to observe the required front yard as specified in the Zoning Ordinance.

The structural plans for such towers must be approved by the City Engineering Department and a permit issued.
Section 4.35. SITE DEVELOPMENT PLAN. (Ordinance #149, Adopted 4/2/74). Prior to an amendment to the Zoning Map of the City of Moultrie, upon the request of an owner to prospective developer concerning all zones except R-1A, R-1B, R-PUD, and C-PUD, the applicant for the proposed amendment shall present to the Planning Commission a site development plan. Before approval or denial of such proposed amendment, the Planning Commission shall review the site development plan for compatibility with requirements of this Ordinance and may impose other special requirements on the plan it deems necessary in order to properly evaluate the proposed amendment. As a minimum, the Planning Commission may require the following to be shown on the plan:

b. A topographic map showing the general location of existing property lines, streets, alleys, buildings, easements, water bodies, and other physical site features which relate to the development.
c. The proposed method of water supply, sewage disposal, and storm drainage.
d. All proposed uses of the property to be developed, including proposed locations of structures, streets, and refuse areas.
e. Date, North Point, Scale.

Section 4.36. Any building or manufactured building that is built for use in the City of Moultrie, Georgia, shall conform to the requirements of the latest edition and amendments of the ?Southern Standard Building Code? and the ?National Electrical Code.?
Section 4.37. SATELLITE RECEIVING ANTENNA.

Section 4.38. BED AND BREAKFAST HOMESTAYS.
(Amended/Adopted by Council November 2, 2010Ordinance #2010-88).
It is the purpose and intent of the Mayor and Council that any Bed and Breakfast Homestay accommodations differ from apartments, apartment houses, lodging houses, boarding houses and rooming houses in that they are truly transient accommodations, with guests rarely staying more than a few days and enjoying at least a morning meal on the premises. In addition, the owner or manager of a Bed and Breakfast Homestay must live on the immediate premises and must be present at all times guests are registered thereat or present on the premises.

R-PUD RESIDENTIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
Section 10.01. RESIDENTIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT. It is the intention of this section to provide areas of sufficient size and allowing reasonable flexibility in design and orientation for the establishment of a structure, or group of structures, which includes multiple dwellings designed in a planned unit development of more than one building on a given site. The requirements of the area, height, bulk, and placement regulations, as they are usually applicable to individual buildings and individual lots of record, would in certain cases of large scale development results affording less protection to the public health, safety, and welfare than if a measure of flexibility were permitted. The permitting of these planned unit developments as special and particular land use can, in certain cases, increase the desirability and convenience to the residents or occupants of the planned unit development without causing adverse effects on adjoining properties.
Therefore, the Zoning Ordinance regulations relative to area, height, bulk, and placement may, in the Planned Unit Development District, be modified by the Planning Commission in the case for a large scale development which, in the judgment of the Planning Commission, provides adequate open space and improvements for circulation, recreation, education, light, air, and service needs of the tract when fully developed, provided that in no case may the density of the proposed planned unit development exceed 13.5 dwelling units per acre and provided further that the minimum site size for the residential planned unit development is three (3) acres. (NOTE: Density amended by Ordinance #143, dated 2/19/74)
Within the Residential Planned Unit Development District, the following regulations shall apply:
Section 10.02. PERMITTED USES. In all R-PUD Districts, no building or land, except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance, shall be erected or used except for one or more of the following specified uses:

b. Community garages serving the principal residential building, containing space for no more than two (2) passenger vehicles for each dwelling unit in the principal building on the lot.
c. Maintenance and management buildings to serve the multiple dwellings.
d. Private swimming pools designed and operated only for occupants of the principal multiple dwellings and their personal guests.

C-PUD, COMMERCIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT
Section 14.01. COMMERCIAL PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT. It is the intention of this section to provide areas of sufficient size and allowing reasonable flexibility in design and orientation for the establishment of a structure or group of structures which include one or more retail sales, service and office enterprises on a single parcel of land in the form generally known as a ?one stop shopping center.?
In the case for a plan for a large scale development which, in the judgment of the Planning Commission, provides adequate open space and improvements for pedestrian and vehicular circulation, light, air, and service needs of the tract when fully developed, the application of the usual requirements of area, height, bulk, and placement is not intended within the Planned Unit Development. The application of these usual restrictions in certain large-scale developments may have results affording less protection to the public health, safety, and welfare than if this is intended measure of flexibility were permitted. The intent of this district is to increase the desirability and convenience to the users of the development without causing adverse effects on the adjoining properties.
The minimum size of a Commercial Planned Unit Development District is 4 acres.
Within the Commercial Planned Unit Development Districts, the following regulations shall apply:
Section 14.02. USES PERMITTED
1. Automobile car wash establishments.
2. Automobile service stations in accordance with the provisions of Section 14.06.

DESIGN STANDARDS FOR COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT
(Adopted 2/18/03)
Section 15.01 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE. Design standards for commercial development established in this article are intended to visually indicate proximity to downtown by keying off of the historic commercial and industrial styles present in town, to maintain the character of the rural highway experience with informal architecture, required building setbacks, and landscaping while allowing for flexibility in design, and to re-establish, promote, and/or preserve the rural landscape. The intent of the district also is to implement further the following policies of the Comprehensive Plan: To further identify scenic views and determine strategies for retaining such areas, to protect viable and stable neighborhoods from uses not in keeping with their established character and use, to guide commercial growth and development should to commercial clusters and away from strip development, and to encourage the strategic development of the East By-Pass (a.k.a. Veterans Parkway) in order to maintain its integrity as a major U. S. Highway.
Section 15.02 APPLICABILITY OF STANDARDS. The design standards for commercial development shall be applicable to all commercial zones- C-1, C-1R, C-1T, C-2, C-2R, C-3, C-3R, C-4, C-PUD. In the C-1, C-1R, C-1T, C-2, and C-2R Districts, the standards of Building Zone 1 as established in the criteria of Section 15.05 shall apply in order to protect viable and stable neighborhoods from uses not in keeping with their established character. In the C-3, C-3R, C-4, C-PUD, the standards of Building Zone 1 or Building Zone 2 as established in the criteria of Section 15.05 shall apply to allow greater flexibility in the design options, since such districts typically are oriented towards major thoroughfares and outside of neighborhoods.
Section 15.03 PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS FOR APPROVAL OF PERMIT. At the time of submission of building plans for plan review for building permit approval, the applicant shall submit detailed architectural drawings demonstrating compliance with the design standards. No plans shall be accepted without drawings in sufficient detail to allow Community Development and planning staff to assess compliance. Within ten- (10) business days, the Community Development and Planning Director, or his/her designee shall review the architectural drawings and determine if the proposed design complies with the standards established in Section 15.05.
If the proposed design does not meet the standards, the Community Development and Planning Director, or his/her designee, shall submit to the applicant in writing via certified mail with return receipt the standards with which the proposed design does not comply. The applicant shall have ten (10) business days from receipt of the notification to resubmit architectural drawings demonstrating compliance with the standards. Failure to resubmit architectural drawings within the specified time period will result in denial of the application for a building permit. The applicant shall have the right to appeal the decision of the Community Development and Planning Director, or his/her designee, to the Moultrie-Colquitt County Planning Commission only after the applicant has resubmitted architectural drawings in accordance with the process above and the Community Development and Planning Director, or his/her designee, has determined the revised drawings do not comply with the design standards.

b. Development Options
For the purposes of this article, commercial development shall be classified into two (2) categories: (1) Individual businesses with single and shared accesses and (2) Limited access business clusters.
(1) In order to provide a functional and aesthetically desirable arrangement of buildings, parking, and landscaping, commercial developments in the fist category shall be designed as in Figure 15.B or in a similar manner to meet the intent of these standards.
(2) In order to provide a functional and aesthetically desirable arrangement of buildings, parking, and landscaping, commercial developments in the second category shall be designed as Figure 15.C or in a similar manner to meet the intent of these standards.
c. Landscaping and Buffer Zone Standards
(1) Sites without trees on site.
Business developed within Building Zone 2 shall be required to plant a 50 feet wide strip of native vegetation in front of their building and parking facilities to buffer the view from the road. Business signage would be allowed to be placed to be visible from the road. Trees shall be planted in a randomized 10 x 10 grid fashion. Costs can be mitigated by planting seedlings or by planting fewer, but larger specimens.
(2) Sites with trees on site.
All trees in the 50 feet wide buffer strip shall be preserved. New planting may be necessary and shall be required to meet the density of a 10 x 10 randomized grid planting. Any trees removed for a building site shall be replaced on site.
d. Architectural Standards
The goals of the architectural standards are to encourage an informal character of the rural highway experience in undeveloped corridors of the City of Moultrie, to preserve the context and character of the City of Moultrie, and to encourage creativity and high quality design and construction. The concepts that serve as the basis for the architectural standards are to:
(1) Locate new construction within the designated building zones.

(2) Group businesses when possible into informal clusters to appear as ?farm units.?
(3) Restrict height to preserve rural appearance.
(4) Make buildings pedestrian friendly at street level.
(5) Draw upon existing architectural styles that are easily translated into contemporary designs.
(6) Use existing commercial and industrial buildings in Moultrie for design ideas.
(7) Not imitate historic styles that can appear ?fake.?
(8) Provide extra amenities that promote good environmental practices.
In order to achieve the above goals and implement the above design concepts, new commercial development shall meet the following design standards as applicable:
(1) Building Orientation
(a) Buildings shall be oriented towards the commercial corridor that abuts it.
(b) The building shall be oriented to clearly demarcate and allow pedestrian entry and access into the building.
(c) The building shall be oriented to allow for the location of parking in accordance with paragraph ?a? of Section 15.05.
(2) Setbacks
(a) New construction shall be located only in the building zones defined in paragraph ?a? of Section 15.05.
(b) Setbacks shall determine the degree of flexibility in architectural standards. New construction in Building Zone 1 shall meet all of the architectural standards established in this subsection. New construction in Building Zone 2 shall be subject to less stringent architectural standards contingent upon meeting the buffer requirements of Section 15.05.c.
(3) Scale
(a) Buildings shall be intimately scaled to provide a pedestrian friendly atmosphere. Scale shall be determined by the distance across a space in relationship to surrounding buildings. The distance to height ratio shall not exceed four (4).
(b) The scale of new buildings shall be compatible with neighboring buildings.
Zoning Ordinance reprinted and distributed September 1, 2011
129
(4) Massing
(a) Buildings over 5,000 square feet in Building Zone 1 shall be broken up to look
like multiple buildings rather than one large ?box.? Figure 15.D illustrates a
possible arrangement for buildings over 5,000 square feet.
(b) The massing of buildings shall be varied to add interest to the structure. This
shall be achieved by varying the horizontal and vertical planes of the exterior
walls and varying the height of distinct elements. Figure 15.E illustrates desirable
versus undesirable elements.

(5) Rhythm
(a) Openings, such as windows and doors, materials and textures, and architectural
features shall be used to visually ?break up? the walls.
(b) The window/door opening solid to void ratio shall be 50% wall to 50% window or
door openings on the first floor and 70% wall to 30% window or door openings
on upper floors within Building Zone 1. The Community Development and
Planning Director may approve a 60% wall to 40% window or door openings on
the first floor in Building Zone 1 if the applicant provides information that the
variation in the ratio will maintain the existing character of the area in which the
building is to be located.

FOOTNOTES TO ARTICLE XVIII.
SCHEDULE OF REGULATIONS.
a. PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS. The requirements of area, height, bulk, and placement regulations, as they are usually applicable to individual buildings in lots of record, would in certain cases of large-scale developments have results affording less protection to the public health, safety, and welfare than if a measure of flexibility were permitted. The permitting of these planned unit developments as special exceptions can, in certain cases, increase the desirability and convenience to the residents or occupants of the planned unit development without causing adverse effects in adjoining properties.
Therefore, the Zoning Ordinance regulations relative to area, height, bulk, and placement may be modified by the Planning Commission in the case for a plan of a large-scale development which, in the judgement of the Planning Commission, provides adequate open space and improvements for circulation, recreation, education, light, air, and service needs of the tract when fully developed, provided that in no case may the density of the proposed planned unit development exceed that of the Zoning Ordinance requirements, and provided further that the minimum site size for residential planned unit development is three (3) acres and commercial planned unit development is four (4) acres.
b. In the M-1, M-2, and AG Districts, publicly owned buildings, public utility buildings, telephone exchange buildings, electric transformer stations and substations and gas regulator stations necessary for the provision of essential services to the area by governmental units or public utilities will be permitted on lots having the minimum area, width, yard, and coverage requirements set forth in the R-1 District of this Ordinance.
c. Semi-detached dwellings constructed in R-2 or R-3 Districts shall have a minimum lot area of 20,000 square feet. Multiple dwellings constructed in R-2 or R-3 Districts shall comply with the following regulations:
Lot Area-10,000 square feet for the first dwelling unit plus the additional lot area requirements as follows:
Type of Dwelling Unit

150
e. All accessory farm buildings for uses other than those incidental to dwelling, shall be located not less than one hundred (100) feet from any dwelling and not less than twenty-five (25) feet from any lot line or property boundary, with the exception that the main farm barn building shall not be less than one hundred and fifty (150) feet from the front property line. This requirement shall not apply to alteration or addition to any existing barn or accessory buildings which are located close to the road and which existed prior to the adoption of this Ordinance.
f. Where a front yard of lesser depth than specified in the Schedule of Regulations exists in front of dwellings on more than sixty (60%) percent of the lots of record on one side of the street in any one block in R-1A, R-1B, and R-2 Districts, the depths of the front for any building hereafter erected or replaced on any lot in such block need not be greater than the average depth of front yards of such existing buildings.
g. For every lot for which a multiple residential dwelling is erected, there shall be provided a side yard on each side of the lot. Each side yard shall be increased beyond the yard spaces indicated by one (1) foot for each ten (10) feet or part thereof by which the length of the multiple, row, or terrace dwelling exceeds forty (40) feet in over all dimensions along the adjoining lot line.
h. Side yard restrictions may be waived in C-1, C-2, and C-3 Districts to allow for party wall construction, subject to approval from the Planning Commission, provided that a platted alley adjoins the rear of the property and provided that continuous building development shall not exceed five hundred (500) feet.
i. The minimum floor area per dwelling unit shall not include area basements, open unheated breezeways, and porches, attached garages or utility rooms,
j. Where motels are permitted in a C-3 District, a minimum of two hundred and fifty (250) square feet of floor area per motel unit shall be provided.

Such agreement also provides for the maintenance of open spaces and any improvements on the
tract or lot. Such agreement cannot be altered except with the express written permission of the
easement holder and any other co-signers. A conservation easement may also establish other
provisions and contain standards that safeguard the tracts or lot's special resources from
negative changes. Conservation easements require both the creation of a Homeowners

community- wide scale or land plans at a site development scale, to evaluate the fitness of land
for various uses based at least partially on environmental criteria. The end product of land
suitability analysis is typically a map or set of maps depicting the appropriateness of land areas
for various land uses.
Letter of credit: A type of subdivision improvement guarantee whereby a subdivider secures an

Ordinance. Land between the right of way lines, whether improved or unimproved,
shall be considered part of the street.
Street, collector: Unless otherwise defined by the Major Transportation Plan or
Comprehensive Plan, a collector street is a public street whose function is to collect traffic from
neighborhoods and local streets and which connects to another public street of equal or greater
classification. A collector also may provide direct access to adjacent properties.
Street, dead end: Unless otherwise defined by the Major Transportation Plan or
Comprehensive Plan, a dead end street is a public street that serves properties on either side and
terminates in a cul de sac.
Street, local: Unless otherwise defined in the Major Transportation Plan or Comprehensive
Plan, any public street, except an alley, collector, or arterial, and which has a primary function to
provide direct access to adjoining properties and which serves a limited area only, usually a single
land subdivision.
Street, minor arterial: All arterials not classified as a principal and contains more emphasis
on land access than the higher system as well as a lower level of traffic mobility. Such facilities
may carry local bus routes and provide intra-community continuity but ideally should not
penetrate identifiable neighborhoods. This system should include urban connections to rural
collector roads where such connections have not been classified as major arterials.
Street, major arterial: Unless otherwise defined by the Major Transportation Plan or
Comprehensive Plan, a major arterial street is a street connecting two or more towns or
communities, connecting two highways of equal or greater capacity, or serving as the primary
access to a large land area. A major arterial may also serve a large traffic generator (e.g., an
industrial area) and perform a secondary function of providing local access.
Street, marginal access: A residential street parallel and adjacent to a major thoroughfare and
which provides access to abutting properties with protection from through-traffic.
Street, parkway: A street with limited access on an exceptional right of way permitting
marginal greenway for landscaping.

that is not owned and maintained by a state, county, city, or another public entity.
Subdivider: Any person, as defined by this Ordinance, who undertakes the subdivision of land,
and any person having such a proprietary interest in land to be subdivided as will authorize the
13
maintenance of proceedings to subdivide such land under this Ordinance, or the authorized agent
of such person.
Subdivision: A division of a tract or parcel of land into two or more lots, building sites, or other
divisions for the purpose of sale or building development, whether immediate or future. This may
include all division of land involving the dedication of a new street or a change in existing streets.
The word subdivision includes re-subdivision and, when appropriate to the context, relates
either to the process of subdividing or to the actual land or area which is subdivided following
approval of the Plan Review Group.
Subdivision, minor: A subdivision of four or fewer lots, which does not involve the
construction of a new public or private street. Because minor subdivisions do not involve the
construction of a new public or private street, they are processed administratively by the Plan
Review Group as final plat applications that do not require preliminary plat approval. Any
improvements to an existing public street abutting the tract proposed for minor subdivision, or
the installation of Utilities along said existing public road, as may be required to comply with this
Ordinance, shall be done according to plans and permit requirements of this Ordinance, but said
requirements shall not subject the minor subdivision to the requirements for a major subdivision
as specified in this Ordinance.
Subdivision, major: The division of a tract or parcel of land into five or more lots which may
or may not involve the construction of a new public or private street; or any subdivision that
involves the construction of a new public or private street. Because major subdivisions involve
construction of a new public or private street or the upgrade of an existing private access way to
City standards, construction plans and land disturbance permits are required, and major
subdivisions are therefore processed in multiple steps including preliminary plat approval (unless
specifically exempted), approval of construction plans and issuance of land disturbance permits,
and final plat approval.
Subdivision, Commercial: All divisions of a tract or a parcel of land into two (2) or more lots,
any one of which shall contain a gross area of less than or equal to twenty-five (25) acres, building
sites, or other divisions for the purpose, whether immediate or future development, sale or lease
of land for commercial and/or office use.
Subdivision, Conservation: A subdivision, as defined by this Ordinance, where open space is
the central organizing element of the subdivision design and that identifies and permanently
protects all primary and all or some of the secondary conservation areas within the boundaries of
14
the subdivision.
Usable area: The net usable portion of a lot, tract or stand, not including any additional
property within the legal boundaries of the parcel which by virtue of permanent or seasonal
inundation by surface water, crossing by rights of way or easements, steep slopes and the like, is
not suitable for the construction of habitable dwellings or drain fields.
Utility: Public or private water or sewer piping systems, water or sewer pumping stations,
electric power lines, fuel or gas pipelines, telephone lines, roads, cable telephone line, fiber optic
cable, driveways, bridges, river/lake access facilities, storm water systems and drainage ways, and
railroads or other Utilities identified by the City . As appropriate to the context, the term utility
may also include all persons, companies, or governmental agencies supplying the same.
Variance: A grant of relief from the strict requirements of this Ordinance which permits
construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this Code; a minimal relaxation
or modification of the strict terms of this Ordinance as applied to specific property when, because
of particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical condition of the property,
compliance would result in practical difficulty.
Wetlands: Wetland is defined as land having the water table at, near, or above the land surface
or which is saturated for a long enough period to promote wetland or aquatic processes as
indicated by hydric soils, hydrophytic vegetation, and various kinds of biological activity which
are adapted to the wet environment.
Zoning Officer: The Planning Director or his designee
Zoning ordinance: Refers to the City of Moultries zoning ordinance.

division of land pursuant to a judicial partition, or any division of land
occurring from the foreclosure of a deed of trust; provided, however, that
such exemption shall not require the City to issue permits if the resulting lots
or parcels fail to meet any applicable regulations of the local jurisdiction
concerning, easements, lot size, lot width, and other dimensional
requirements.
Section 1.13 Lot Combinations
An existing lot line forming the boundary between
two conforming platted lots located within the same
subdivision or a lot line between lots or parcels that have
merged to form one building lot may be removed or
eliminated through a final plat revision process which
conforms to the requirements of this Ordinance. In the
case no final plat applies to the subject lots or parcels, a
boundary survey and plat depicting all lots involved in the
lot combination shall be required to be approved by the
Plan Review Group and recorded as a final plat. Such
combination plat shall be titled with the same name as
that of the original subdivision, if applicable, and shall indicate thereon that the replat is for the
purpose of removing the lot lines between specific lots. (See Figure 1-1.13).
Figure 1-1.13

Section 1.14 Boundary Line
Adjustments
One or more existing lot lines forming
boundaries between conforming platted lots located
within the same subdivision, or one or more lot lines
between abutting lots or parcels may be adjusted
through a final plat revision process that requires the
approval of the Plan Review Group and recording of a
plat meeting the specifications of a final plat. In the
case no final plat applies to the subject lots or parcels, a
boundary survey and plat of the entire lots involved in
the boundary line adjustment shall be required to be
approved by the Plan Review Group and recorded. Such plat showing said boundary line
adjustment shall be titled with the same name as that of the original subdivision and shall include
thereon that the replat is for the purpose of adjusting the lot lines between specific lots. (See
Figure 1-1.14)
Section 1.15 Land is One Tract Until Subdivided
Until property proposed for subdivision has received final plat approval and been properly
recorded, the land involving the subdivision shall be considered as one tract, or as otherwise
legally recorded.
Section 1.16 All Land Subdivisions To Comply
No person shall sell, advertise, or offer to sell, by deed, map, plat or other instrument, any
parcel of land not subdivided under the requirements of this Ordinance. It shall be unlawful for
any person to transfer or sell land by reference to, or by exhibition of, or by other use of, a plat of
a land subdivision that has not been approved and recorded in accordance with the requirements
of this Ordinance. The description of such land by metes and bounds in the instrument of
transfer shall not exempt the transaction. No plat of land subdivision shall be entitled to be
recorded in the Office of the Clerk of the Colquitt County Court, and it shall be unlawful to record
Figure 1-1.14

Article II
APPEALS
Section 2.01 Purpose
These regulations establish a Board of Zoning Appeals and provide a mechanism for relief
in an individual case where certain dimensional requirements of this code pose undue hardship.
These regulations also provide for appeals from actions of the Zoning Officer in the

delegated by the Governing Body is limited to the provisions herein and shall be sparingly used
by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
Section 2.02 Board of Zoning Appeals
A Board of Zoning Appeals is hereby established. Said board shall consist of five voting
members, who are residents and registered voters of the City of Moultrie, each of whom shall
serve for terms of three years without compensation. None of the members of the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall be a member of the Governing Body, but one member of the Planning
commission may serve on the Board of Zoning Appeals. The board members shall be appointed
by the Mayor with the approval of the City Council. In case any vacancy should occur in the
membership of the board for any cause, the Mayor shall fill such vacancy by making an
appointment for the unexpired term with the approval of the City Council. Any members of the
board may be removed by the Mayor for due cause or upon expiration of term, subject to the
approval of the City Council.
Section 2.03 Meetings
The Board of Zoning Appeals shall adopt rules of procedure as are necessary to carry out
the purposes of its authority. The Board shall establish a regular meeting date and time for its
meetings; however, meetings shall be held only on an as-needed basis and shall be open to the
public. The Board shall appoint a secretary, who shall be the Zoning Officer unless otherwise
20
designated, to record the minutes of its proceedings, showing the action of each board member
upon each question. The Board shall keep records of its examinations and other official actions,
all of which shall be filed with the Planning and Community Development Department and be
public records. The Zoning Officer shall serve as the advisor to the Board, except in cases of an
appeal from a decision of the Zoning Officer. The Board may adjourn any public hearing or
meeting in order to obtain additional information, or to serve further notice upon such other
property owners as it decides may be interested in the application or appeal; provided, however,
that the Board shall act on all applications within 64 days of the date the initial public hearing on
the matter was scheduled. If the Board takes no action is within 64 days of the initial public
hearing, the application or appeal will be considered successful.
Section 2.04 Authority to Grant Variances
The Board of Zoning Appeals is authorized to receive, consider, grant, grant with
conditions, or deny applications for variances to the dimensional requirements of this code, after
a public hearing and after making written findings of fact that the conditions for variances
specified herein have been fulfilled. In granting a variance, the Board may impose such
requirements and conditions with respect to the location, construction, maintenance and
operation of any use or building, in addition to those expressly set forth herein, as may be
deemed necessary for the protection of adjacent properties and the public interest. Decisions of
the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be final; there shall be no appeal to the Mayor and City
Council, but the applicant aggrieved by a decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals may pursue
appeals to the Courts of proper jurisdiction of the State of Georgia as provided by law.
Section 2.05 Variance Applications
A property owner or his authorized agent may initiate a request for variance by filing an
application with the Zoning Officer. The application shall be accompanied by a site plan, drawn
to scale, showing the dimensions and arrangement of the proposed development. The Zoning
Officer may require other drawings or materials essential to an understanding of the proposed
use and variance requested and its relationship to the surrounding properties. A fee shall
accompany variance applications as established by the Governing Body by Ordinance from time
to time.
21
Section 2.06 Conditions and Criteria for Granting a Variance
The Board of Zoning Appeals, in cases where specifically authorized, may grant a variance
only after consideration and adoption of findings of fact that all of the following conditions exist
and criteria are met.
a. There are unusual, exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions
applying to the property that do not apply generally to other property in the
same vicinity or use district, and such conditions are not the result of the
owners or occupants own actions. Such conditions may include topography,
unique natural conditions, surroundings of the subject property, or the size or
peculiar shape of the lot.
b. As a result of such unusual circumstance or conditions, there is an
unnecessary hardship or practical difficulty that renders it difficult to carry out
the provisions of this code.
c. The authorization of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the
public welfare or injurious to property in the vicinity or district in which
property is located, and the variance will be in harmony with the general
purposes and intent of the provisions of this code.
d. The variance approved is the minimum variance that will make possible the
legal use of the land, building or structure.
e. The variance does not permit a use of land, building or structure which is not
permitted by right in the land use intensity district in which the proposed
development is located.
f. The board may grant a hardship variance on medical grounds provided that
the request is accompanied by documentation of medical disability, age or
infirmity that is certified by a medical doctors statement. The medical
22
hardship variance must be renewed annually.
Section 2.07 Staff Investigation and Report
The Zoning Officer shall make an investigation of all variance applications and shall
prepare a report thereon, considering applicable criteria specified herein. Said investigation shall
be submitted to the Board of Zoning Appeals. Said investigation shall also be made available to
the applicant prior to any public hearing scheduled on the matter. This provision shall not apply
to appeals of administrative decisions of the Zoning Officer.
Section 2.08 Appeals of Administrative Decisions
Any person who alleges there is an error in, or who is aggrieved by a decision of the Zoning
Officer in the administration, enforcement, and/or interpretation of this code, may file an appeal
with the Planning and Community Development Department stating the grounds for such appeal.
The Board of Zoning Appeals is hereby authorized to hear and decide said appeals, after proper
application, public hearing and adoption of relevant findings of fact.
An appeal from a ruling of the Zoning Officer shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of
the action being appealed. The Board may affirm, overrule or modify, in whole or in part, the
rulings of the Zoning Officer. In cases where an appeal is granted, the Board shall have all
necessary powers of the Zoning Officer and may issue building permits and land use permits, or
direct the issuance of building permits and land use permits not otherwise inconsistent with this
code and any other code, resolution, or ordinance adopted by the Governing Body.
Section 2.09 Notice and Hearing
Upon the filing of any complete application for a variance with the Zoning Officer, or upon
the filing of any complete application for appeal with the Planning and Community Development
Department, a public hearing shall be scheduled and held on the proposed variance or appeal.
Notice of the public hearing shall be given and the public hearing shall be conducted as provided
for in Chapter 4 of this code.
23
Section 2.10 Action on Appeals and Variances
The Board shall make findings and render a decision in writing within 32 days after the
initial public hearing on the proposed variance or appeal. The Boards Secretary shall notify the
applicant, in writing, of its decision within five days after the Board has rendered its decision. If
no decision is made within 32 days, the application will be considered as approved.

Article III
SUBDIVISION PROCEDURE
Section 3.01 Purpose
The purpose of this section is to ensure compliance with the basic design concepts and
improvement requirements of subdivisions and land developments through the submittal of a
tentative map, tied to the City of Moultrie monument system, of all major subdivisions for review
by the Plan Review Group, Planning Commission and Mayor and City Council.
Section 3.02 When Required
All major subdivisions, and any subdivision involving the construction of a public or
private street, shall require the submission of a preliminary plat for review and approval to the
Plan Review Group and approval by the Planning Commission and Mayor and City Council. Prior
to the issuance of any permit for land disturbance, or the installation of any improvements, the
Planning Commission and Mayor and City Council must approve the preliminary plat, if
required.
Section 3.03 Preapplication Conference
Any major subdivision requires the developer to schedule a preapplication conference with
representatives of the Plan Review Group prior to submitting a preliminary plat. At this meeting,
in addition to the standard information such as location, size etc. of the proposed subdivision, the
developer must provide one preliminary sketch of the proposed subdivision that reflects the
requirements of this ordinance. The developer is responsible for presenting this information in
both printed and digital formats.
25
Section 3.04 Preliminary Plat Application and Specifications
Preliminary plat applications shall be made in accordance with requirements shown in Table 3-
3.13, and preliminary plats shall meet the minimum plat specifications shown in Table 3-3.14.
Preliminary plat applications must be submitted in digital and printed formats.
Section 3.05 Procedures
After the required preliminary conference a preliminary plat shall be submitted to
the zoning officer. Upon receipt of a completed preliminary plat application, the Zoning officer
shall schedule the application for the next public meeting before the Planning Commission and
forward all pertinent materials in the application to the Planning Commission for review, including an
outline of proposed covenants, if necessary. An application for preliminary plat approval must be
submitted by the 2nd Friday of the preceding month of the regular meeting date of the Planning
Commission to be considered on that agenda. The Planning Commission shall have 32 days from the
date the public meeting is held to approve, conditionally approve, or deny the preliminary plat
application. The basis of the Planning Commissions review of and action on a preliminary plat shall
be whether the preliminary plat meets the purposes and requirements of this Ordinance, and all other
Ordinances that relate to the proposed development. The Planning Commissions decision will then be
transmitted to the Mayor and City Council for a final determination.
Section 3.06 Disposition
Approval of a preliminary plat shall be valid for a period of one year, during which time a
complete construction plan application must be submitted. If a completed application for
construction plans is not submitted during that time, preliminary plat approval shall expire and be
null and void. Substantial changes, as determined by the Plan Review Group, to the plan shall require
a new preliminary plat.
Section 3.07 Certificate of Approval
Upon approval of the preliminary plat a certificate, stamped directly on the plat shall state:
26
"Pursuant to the Land Subdivision Regulations City of Moultrie, Georgia, and all requirements
of approval having been fulfilled, this preliminary plat was given approval by the Planning
Commission on ______________________, 20___ and Mayor on
______________________, 20___. This approval does not constitute approval of a final
plat. This certificate of approval shall expire and become null and void on
_____________________, 20______, one (1) year from the above date of approval.
Planning Commission Chairman
Mayor
Section 3.08 Appeal
Denial of preliminary plat approval may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals of the
City of Moultrie as appointed by the Mayor and City Council of the City of Moultrie.
Section 3.09 Amendments to Approved Preliminary Plats
The Plan Review Group is authorized to approve minor amendments to preliminary plats.
After review and approval of the Plan Review Group, any proposed amendment to a sketch plat
that is determined by the Plan Review Group to constitute a public interest shall be deemed a
major amendment. For all amendments to preliminary plats determined to be major
amendments, Planning Commission approval shall be required. The Planning Commission shall
approve, conditionally approve, or deny the proposed major amendment to a preliminary plat.
Procedures for considering a major amendment to a preliminary plat shall be the same as
required for an initial application for preliminary plat approval.
Section 3.10 Construction Plan Application
Upon approval of a preliminary plat, the subdivider or land developer may apply for
construction plan approval. In the case of a minor subdivision, or in cases where a preliminary
plat is not required by this article, the subdivider or land developer may apply for approval of
construction plans; provided, however, that in the case of a minor subdivision or land
27
development the applicant for construction plan approval should hold a pre-application
conference with the Plan Review Group to ensure that plans meet the intent and specific
provisions of this Ordinance and other applicable regulations. The construction plan approval
process is administrative. Applications for construction plan approval shall be made in
accordance with requirements shown in Table 3-3.13 and Table 3-3.14. No application for
construction plans shall be accepted for processing nor approved by the Plan Review Group until
a preliminary plat, if required, has been approved by the Planning Commission as well as the
Mayor and City Council. Construction plans must be submitted in both paper and digital formats
wherever possible.
Section 3.11 Plan Review Groups Decision Criteria
The only basis upon which the Plan Review Group may deny a construction plan is the
failure of the application to meet the requirements of this ordinance or any other applicable state
or local regulations or the failure of the construction plans and application to meet the
requirements of preliminary plat approval specified by the Planning Commission. Substantial
deviations from the preliminary plat must go back to the Planning Commission at the discretion
of the Planning Director.
Section 3.12 Construction Plan Certificate of Approval
All copies of the construction plans shall be noted by inscription on the plat noting such
approval by the Plan Review Group and the appropriate representatives from city departments.
Construction plan approval shall expire and be null and void after a period of one year, unless
activity toward improvements on the land has been initiated, or unless the Plan Review Group
approves an extension of time.
Section 3.13 Final Plat Approval
All major subdivisions, minor subdivisions, and dedications shall require final plat
approval. The final plat approval process is administrative. Applications shall be made in
accordance with requirements shown in Table 3-3.13

Section 3.17 Recording a Plat
Upon satisfactory compliance with these regulations and after approval by the Planning
Commission, the final plat will be forwarded to the Moultrie Planning Director to retain until
such time that all required minimum improvements have been completed, accepted by the city,
and the required guarantee has been posted with the Clerk for the City of Moultrie. At such time
the Moultrie Planning Director shall release said final plat to the owner, developer or authorized
agent for recording in the office of the Clerk of Superior Court, in Colquitt County, Georgia.
Section 3.18 Subdivision Improvement and Maintenance
Guarantees
In order to protect the City and prospective purchasers of and residents in a subdivision,
the subdivider/developer shall provide to the City financial security to guarantee the installation
of public improvements and required maintenance. The subdivider's or developer's financial
guarantee may be any of the following:
(a) An escrow of funds with the City ;
(b) An escrow with a bank or savings and loan association upon which the City can draw;
(c) An irrevocable letter of commitment or credit upon which the City can draw;
(d) A performance bond for the benefit of the City upon which the City can collect, or a
certificate of deposit with assignment letter; and
(e) Any other form of guarantee approved by the Mayor and City Council that will satisfy
the objectives of this section. The guarantee shall be in an amount to secure the full
costs, as determined by the City, of constructing or installing the required
improvements and utilities and, where necessary, to cover maintenance costs for a
minimum of two years.
Section 3.19 Limitations on Minor Subdivisions
Minor subdivisions provide certain advantages, such as a shorter application process and
less public scrutiny, that tend to favor their use over the filing of major subdivision applications.
Given these advantages, the prospect exists that subdividers may seek to divide a parcel via
consecutive and/or contiguous minor subdivisions instead of filing for a major subdivision. It is
the intent of the Mayor and City Council to prohibit the practice of chain subdivisions where the
34
same land owner subdivides land and then files minor subdivision applications on common
contiguous parcels, which collectively total more than four lots. It is also the intent of the Mayor
and City Council to prohibit minor subdivisions adjacent to each other within a three-year time
period, in cases where part of an original tract of land is now owned by another person or entity
and was transferred or sold to another owner with the apparent intent to circumvent the major
subdivision process.
Section 3.20 Common Contiguous Parcels Shown on Minor
Subdivision Plats
Contiguous common parcels, as defined by this Ordinance, shall be referenced on all
applications for minor subdivisions, and contiguous common parcels shall be considered part of
any application for minor subdivision, for purposes of determining whether or not the division of
land proposed is a major subdivision or a minor subdivision. Common contiguous parcels shall
not be counted as lots in the case of a minor subdivision.
Section 3.21 Limitations
Land within a minor subdivision, including all contiguous parcels owned by the
subdivider, shall not be further divided for a period of three years unless a preliminary plat
application is filed and approved as a major subdivision pursuant to the requirements of this
Ordinance. If property proposed to be subdivided was part of an original tract, and if the
property proposed to be subdivided abuts land that has been divided as a minor subdivision in
the last three years, then minor subdivision of said property shall be prohibited. This provision
shall not be construed to prohibit the approval of two contiguous minor subdivisions under
separate ownership; however, this provision is intended to be construed liberally so that one
property owner does not develop a minor subdivision on part of an original tract and transfer or
sell another part of the original tract for the purposes of minor subdivision within a three year
period. It is the intent that land abutting a minor subdivision that was owned by the subdivider
of the abutting minor subdivision shall not be subdivided as a minor subdivision for a period of
three years, regardless of ownership.
35
Section 3.22 Private Streets Permitted
Private streets may, upon application, be permitted by the Mayor and City Council within
major subdivisions, subject to the requirements of this section. Applications for approval of
private streets shall be considered by the Mayor and City Council at the time of preliminary plat
approval by the Planning Commission. Following a recommendation by the Planning
Commission to authorize private streets in a major subdivision, the Mayor and City Council shall
consider the application and shall require the creation of a Homeowners Association for those
served by the private street prior to the approval of private streets to ensure various public
purposes and to mitigate potential problems with private streets. No final plat involving a private
street shall be approved unless said final plat conforms to the requirements of this section.
Section 3.23 Engineering Plans Required
It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to construct a new private street or
alter an existing private street or to cause the same to be done without first obtaining approval of
engineering and construction plans from the Plan Review Group in accordance with the
requirements of this Ordinance and Section 2.3 of this code.
Section 3.24 Standards
All private streets shall be constructed to all standards for public streets required by
Chapter 2 of this code, applicable construction specifications of the City Engineer, and as
approved by the City Engineer.
Section 3.25 Street Names And Signs
Private streets shall be named, subject to the approval of the Chief Fire Officer. The
subdivider of land involving a private street shall install street signs containing the street name,
the designation private, and any other information as approved by the Public Works Director.
The sign signifying the private street may be required by the Public Works Director to be a
36
different color than that of street signs provided for public streets, in order to distinguish
maintenance responsibilities in the field.
Section 3.26 Easements for Private Streets
Easements for private streets shall be designated on final plats as general-purpose public
access and utility easements, along with the name of said private street. Said easement shall at
minimum be of the same width as that required for the right-of-way of a public street by the
major thoroughfare plan and the City Engineer for the type of public street (local, collector, etc.)
most closely resembling the proposed private street. Easements for private streets shall not be
included in any calculation of minimum lot size or density limitations established by local land
use regulations. In the cases of private streets, the general-purpose public access and utility
easement for the private street shall either;
1. Be shown in a manner on the final plat such that each lot fronting the private street
extends to the centerline of the private street. No lot shall be permitted to be divided
by the general purpose public access and utility easement required and established for
a private street; or
2. Shall be drawn as its own discrete parcel to be dedicated to a private homeowners
association (i.e., not shown to be a part of any lot).
Section 3.27 Maintenance
The City shall not maintain, repair, resurface, rebuild, or otherwise improve streets, signs,
drainage improvements or any other appurtenances within general purpose public access and
utility easements established for private streets. A private maintenance covenant recorded with
the City Clerk and the Clerk of the County Court shall be required for any private street and other
improvements within general-purpose public access and utility easements established for private
streets. The covenant shall set out the distribution of expenses, remedies for non-compliance
with the terms of the agreement, rights to the use of easements, and other pertinent
considerations. The Covenant shall specifically include the following terms.
(a) The Covenant shall establish minimum annual assessments in an amount adequate
37
to defray costs of ordinary maintenance and procedures for approval of additional
needed assessments. The Covenant shall also specify that the funds from such
assessments will be held by a homeowners or property owners association in cases
of a subdivision fronting on a private street.
(b) The Covenant shall include a periodic maintenance schedule.
(c) The Covenant for maintenance shall be enforceable by any property owner served
by the private street.
(d) The Covenant shall establish a formula for assessing maintenance and repair costs
equitably to property owners served by the private street.
(e) The Covenant shall run with the land.
(f) The Mayor and City Council may, at its discretion, as a condition of approving
private streets, require a performance bond and/or maintenance bond be
submitted by the subdivider and held by a homeowners or property owners
association, or the Council may require that the subdivider pay an amount of
money as recommended by the City Engineer into an escrow account or other
suitable account for the maintenance and repair of private streets and stormwater
management improvements, to be drawn from by the homeowners or property
owners association as maintenance and repair needs may arise for a minimum of
two (2) years.

The Planning Commission may require pedestrian ways and/or easements through the block to
be located near the center in blocks longer than 800 feet.
Section 4.02 Block Width
The width of the block shall normally be sufficient to allow two tiers of lots of appropriate
depth. Blocks intended for business or industrial use shall be of such width as to be considered
most suitable for their respective use,
including adequate space for off-street
parking and deliveries. (See Figure 4-
4.02).
Section 4.03 Natural
Features and Assets
In the subdividing of land, due
regard shall be shown for all natural

watercourses, historic sites or similar
conditions which, if preserved, will
add attractiveness to the proposed
development and safety from hazards. Figure 4-4.02
41
Section 4.04 Access and Minimum Lot Frontage
Each lot shall have access to a public street and a minimum lot frontage on a public street
as detailed in the Schedule of Regulations in the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Moultrie;
provided, however, that the local governing body may permit one or more lots to be accessed by
private streets, as more fully specified in Chapter 2 of this code; provided further, that in the case
of a lot accessed by a circular cul-de-sac, the minimum lot frontage may be reduced to 30 feet.
Section 4.05 Adequate
Buildable Area Required
Land subject to flooding, improper
drainage or erosion, or that is unsuitable for
residential or other use for topographical or
other reasons, shall not be platted for
residential use nor for any other use that
will continue or increase the danger to
health, safety, or of property destruction,
unless the hazards can be and are corrected.
Each lot shall contain an adequate building
site not subject to flooding and outside the
limits of any existing easements or building
setback lines required by the local governing body. (See Figure 4-4.05).
Section 4.06 Lot Remnants Not Permitted
All remnants of lots below any required minimum lot size that may be required, left over
after subdividing of a larger tract, must be added to adjacent lots, rather than allowed to remain
as unusable parcels. The Plan Review Group may permit a lot remnant for a specific purpose such
as a detention pond, provided that access and design is appropriate and the lot remnant is
restricted to specific non-building use.
Figure 4-4.05
42
Section 4.07 Service Areas
Commercial and industrial lots shall be adequate to provide service areas and off-street
parking suitable to the use intended.

separation of residential development from arterials or overcome specific disadvantages of
topography or orientation. Double frontage lots with frontage on a major arterial street shall
have additional depth in order to allow space for screen planting along the lot line abutting a
major arterial street.
Section 4.15 Easements
Where a watercourse, drainage way, channel or stream traverses a subdivision, there shall
be provided a stormwater or drainage easement of adequate width. Easements shall be provided
for all drainage facilities as approved by the City Engineer. Where easements are needed for
utility locations, the subdivider shall provide them to the appropriate utility provider. Where
easements are needed for public water and/or sanitary sewer lines, they shall be provided as
determined appropriate by the City Engineer. All easements required pursuant to this section
shall be shown on the preliminary plat, if required, and final plat.

Article V
CONSERVATION SUBDIVISIONS
Section 5.01 Purpose
(a) To provide a residential zoning district that permits flexibility of design in
order to promote environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of the land.
(b) To preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as
groundwater, floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands and
wildlife habitat.
(c) To preserve important historic and archaeological sites.
(d) To permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally
sensitive soils which will reduce the amount of infrastructure, including
paved surfaces and utility easements, necessary for residential development.
(e) To reduce erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and
removal of vegetation in residential development.
(f) To promote interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the
community.
(g) To promote contiguous greenspace with adjacent jurisdictions.
(h) To encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and
orienting them closer to the street, providing public gathering places and
encouraging use of parks and community facilities as focal points in the
neighborhood.
45
(i) To encourage street designs that reduce traffic speeds and reliance on main
arteries.
(j) To promote construction of convenient landscaped walking trails and bike
paths both within the subdivision and connected to neighboring
communities, businesses, and facilities to reduce reliance on automobiles.
(k) To conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by maximizing the
number of houses with direct access to and views of open space.
(l) To protect prime agricultural land and preserve farming as an economic
activity.
Section 5.02 General Regulations
A. Applicability of Regulations
This Conservation Subdivision option is available as a use by right in all residential zoning
districts. Applicant shall comply with all other provisions of the zoning code and all other
applicable laws, except those that are incompatible with the provisions contained herein.
B. Ownership of Development Site
The tract of land to be subdivided may be held in single and separate ownership or in
multiple ownership. If held in multiple ownership, however, the site shall be developed
according to a single plan with common authority and common responsibility.
C. Housing Density Determination
The maximum number of lots in the Conservation Subdivision shall be determined by
either of the following two methods, at the discretion of the applicant:
1.) Calculation: The maximum number of lots is determined by dividing the
area of the tract of land by the minimum lot size specified in the underlying zoning.
In making this calculation, the following shall not be included in the total area of
the parcel:
46
?? Slopes over 25% of at least 5000 square feet contiguous area;
?? The 100 year floodplain;
?? Bodies of open water over 5000 square feet contiguous area; and
?? Wetlands that meet the definition of the Army Corps of Engineers
pursuant to the Clean Water Act.
2.) Yield Plan: The maximum number of lots is based on a conventional subdivision
design plan, prepared by the applicant, in which the tract of land is subdivided in a
manner intended to yield the highest number of lots possible. The plan does not have to
meet formal requirements for a site design plan, but the design must be capable of being
constructed given site features and all applicable regulations.
Section 5.03 Application Requirements
A.) Site Analysis Map Required
Concurrent with the submission of a site concept plan, Applicant shall prepare and submit
a site analysis map. The purpose of the site analysis map is to ensure that the important site
features have been adequately identified prior to the creation of the site design, and that the
proposed Open Space will meet the requirements of this article. The preliminary site plan shall
included the following features:
1) Property boudaries;
2) All streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands and other hydrologic features;
3) Topographic contours of no less than 10-foot intervals;

permanent protection. Activities within the Open Space are restricted in perpetuity through the
use of an approved legal instrument.
B.) Standards to Determine Open Space
1) The minimum restricted Open Space shall comprise at least 30% of
the gross tract area.
2) The following are considered Primary Conservation Areas and are
required to be included within the Open Space, unless the
Applicant demonstrates that this provision would constitute an
unusual hardship and be counter to the purposes of this article:
?? The 100-year floodplain
?? Riparian zones of at least 75 ft width along all perennial
and intermittent streams
48
?? Slopes above 25% of at least 5000 square feet contiguous
area
?? Wetlands that meet the definition used by the Army
Corps of Engineers pursuant to the Clean Water Act
?? Populations of endangered or threatened species, or
habitat for such species
?? Archaeological sites, cemeteries and burial grounds

permanent protection.
E.) Ownership and Management of Open Space
1) A homeowners association representing residents of the
conservation subdivision shall own the Open Space. Membership
in the association shall be mandatory and automatic for all
homeowners of the subdivision and their successors. The
Homeowners Association shall have lien authority to ensure the
collection of dues from all members. The responsibility for
maintaining the Open Space and any facilities located thereon shall
be borne by the Homeowners Association.
2) Applicant shall submit a Plan for Management of Open Space and
Common Facilities that:
(a) allocates responsibility and guidelines for the
maintenance and operation of the Open Space and
51
any facilities located thereon, including provisions
for ongoing maintenance and for long-term capital
improvements;
(b) estimates the costs and staffing requirements needed
for maintenance and operation of, and insurance

the Mayor and City Council; and
(d) provides for enforcement of the Plan.
3) In the event the party responsible for maintenance of the Open
Space fails to maintain all or any portion in reasonable order and
condition, the City of Moultrie may assume responsibility for its
maintenance and may enter the premises and take corrective
action, including the provision of extended maintenance. The costs
of such maintenance shall be charged to the Homeowners
Association, or to the individual property owners that make up the
Homeowners Association, and may include administrative costs
and penalties. Such costs shall become a lien on all subdivision
properties.
F.) Legal Instrument for Permanent Protection
1) The Open Space shall be protected in perpetuity by a binding legal
instrument that is recorded with the deed. The instrument shall be
one of the following:
(a) A permanent conservation easement in favor of
either:
52
1. a land trust or similar conservation-oriented
non-profit organization with legal authority to
accept such easements. The organization shall
be bona fide and in perpetual existence and the
conveyance instruments shall contain an
appropriate provision for retransfer in the
event the organization becomes unable to
carry out its functions; or
2. a governmental entity with an interest in
pursuing goals compatible with the purposes
of this ordinance.
If the entity accepting the easement is not the City of Moultrie, then a third right of
enforcement favoring the City of Moultrie shall be included in the easement.
(b) A permanent restrictive covenant for conservation
purposes in favor of a governmental entity.
(c) An equivalent legal tool that provides permanent
protection, if approved by Mayor and City Council.
2) The instrument for permanent protection shall include clear restrictions on the
use of the Open Space. These restrictions shall include all restrictions contained
in this article, as well as any further restrictions the Applicant chooses to place
on the use of the Open Space.
G.) Tax Assessment of Open Space
Once a legal instrument for permanent protection has been placed upon the Open
Space, the Colquitt County Tax Assessors office shall be directed to reassess the Open
Space at a lower value to reflect its more limited use. If the Open Space is used purely for
passive recreational purposes and the terms of the instrument for permanent protection
effectively prohibit any type of significant economic activity, then the assessment shall be
at a value of zero.

Article VI
REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS FOR SUBDIVISIONS
AND LAND DEVELOPMENT
Section 6.01 Purpose
The purpose of this Ordinance is to establish minimum design requirements, standards,
and specifications for improvements within subdivisions and land developments.
Section 6.02 Definitions
Definitions pertaining to this Ordinance shall be as provided in Article I, section 1.03 of
this code.
Section 6.03 Authority of Plan Review Group
The Plan Review Group is hereby authorized to review and approve plans for subdivisions
and land developments to ensure compliance with the requirements of this code. The Plan
Review Group is further authorized to prepare and promulgate standards, standard drawings,
and specifications to more specifically implement the intent of the improvement requirements of
this code.
Section 6.04 Applicability and Exception
The improvement requirements specified in this Article shall apply to all developments
except individual lots proposed for development as a detached, single-family dwelling or
manufactured home. Such lots that are a part of a larger land subdivision will initially meet the
requirements of this code section. All improvements required to be constructed as part of a major
subdivision, minor subdivision or land development process shall be constructed and improved,
in accordance with the standards and specifications for construction as required by this code
section and as specified by the Plan Review Group.
55
No person to which this code section applies shall commence construction of any
improvements on any land, prior to the approval of construction plans and engineering plans for
said improvements, as required by Chapter 2 of this code, according to the improvement
standards specified in Article VI of this code and as adopted by the Plan Review Group or
Designee. No building permit or certificate of occupancy shall be issued for a building, structure,
or use, nor shall any excavation, grading, or land disturbance applications be approved, on any
parcel of land that does not meet the improvement requirements specified in this Article and as
adopted by the Plan Review Group or Designee pursuant to this section.
Section 6.05 Engineered Drawings
Engineering drawings for public streets, including cross sections and centerline profiles,
traffic signage and pavement markings, and public and private water, sewer, drainage, and utility
systems, certified by a professional engineer registered in the State of Georgia, or if authorized
under state law, a registered land surveyor, or professional landscape architect, shall be required
to be submitted for review and approval, and such plans must meet the requirements of this
Article and the specifications of the Plan Review Group. Prior to approval and recording of a final
plat, or prior to the approval of any certificate of occupancy, a registered engineer for the
subdivider/developer shall submit one copy of all finished, as-built plans of improvements,
demonstrating that said improvements, as installed, meet the requirements of this code section
and certifying that the plans accurately reflect actual construction and installation. The City
Engineer shall maintain all as-built street plans while the Utility Director shall keep utility plans
for future use by the City.
Section 6.06 Permits for Construction in Public Right-of-Way
Permits from the City Engineer shall be required for construction in any public right-ofway.
Permits will not be issued until such time that plans have been submitted and approved by
the City Engineer. Permit fees shall be approved by resolution of the Mayor and City Council.
Section 6.07 Improvements to Abutting Land
For subdivisions and land developments that abut and access an abutting public street, the
subdivider or land developer shall install curb and gutter, sidewalk, other road improvements,
56
and, as required, a deceleration lane, according to standards and specifications of the City
Engineer, along all abutting public streets. All major residential subdivisions must have street
patterns that conform to the requirements of the International Fire Code, Appendix D, Section
106d or 107d which state that residential subdivisions must have a minimum of two separate
entrance/exit points. When a subdivision or land development uses an unpaved public right-ofway
for access, the subdivider or land developer shall improve that right-of-way to a pavement
width consistent with City road design standards. Said improvements shall be from the
subdivision or land development entrance to the paved City road which the City Engineer
determines will be the primary direction of travel for residents of the subdivision or occupants of
the land development.
Section 6.08 Street Design Requirement
A.) Street Alignment, Intersections and Jogs
Streets shall be aligned to join with planned or existing streets. Under normal conditions,
streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles (90 degrees), but in
no case shall such a street intersection be less than 75 degrees. Where street offsets or jogs
cannot be avoided, offset "T" intersections shall be separated by a minimum centerline offset of
150 feet in urban areas and 300
feet in rural areas. Where any
street intersection will involve
earth banks or existing vegetation
inside any lot corner that would
create a traffic hazard by limiting
visibility, the developer shall cut
such ground and/or vegetation,
including trees in connection with
the grading of the public right-ofway
to the extent deemed
necessary to provide an adequate
sight distance.
(See Figure 1-6.08(A)).
Figure 1-6.08(A)
57
B.) Continuation of Existing Streets and Connections
Existing streets, and their rights-of-way, shall be continued at the same or greater width,
but in no case less than the required width. The Planning Commission may require that a major
subdivision provide one or more future connections to adjoining subdivisions or unsubdivided
tracts.
C.) Street Plans for Future Phases of the Tract
Where the plat or site plan proposed to be subdivided or developed includes only part of
the tract owned or intended for subdivision or development by the subdivider or land developer,
a tentative plan of a future street system for the portion not slated for immediate subdivision
consideration may be required by the Plan Review Group and if required shall be prepared and
submitted by the subdivider or land developer. This tentative plan must reflect the requirements
of the International Fire Code Appendix D, 106 and 107.
D.) Dead End Streets and Cul-De-Sacs
Streets that dead-end shall terminate in a cul-de-sac. The maximum length of such streets
shall be 600 feet in urban areas and 1,200 feet in rural areas. In no case may a Cul-De-Sac have a
length that is less than 200 feet from the nearest street ROW to the back ROW of Cul-De-Sac.
The bulb ROW must have a minimum 60 foot radius. The bulb pavement must have a 96 foot
diameter. Streets that are planned to continue at some future date shall provide a temporary culde-
sac as required by the City Engineer.
E.) Marginal Access Streets
Whenever a major subdivision is proposed abutting the right-of-way of a U.S. or State
highway, a marginal access street approximately parallel and adjacent to such right-of-way may
be required by the Plan Review Group at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of land
between such marginal access street and highway right-of-way. The Plan Review Group may also
require a 20-foot no-access easement and planting strip along the major arterial street to ensure
that lots fronting on said street do not have access thereto. (See Figure 2-6.08(E)).
58
F.) Alleys and Service Access
Alleys may be provided. If they are provided, they must be paved. Dead-end alleys shall
be avoided where possible; but if unavoidable, they shall be provided with adequate turn-around
facilities that meet the standards set forth in 6.08(D) above. Service access shall be provided to
commercial and industrial developments for off-street loading, unloading, and parking consistent
with and adequate for the uses proposed.
G.) Bridges
Bridges on public rights-of-way shall meet current American Association of State Highway
and Transportation Officials standards, International Fire Code Standards and other standards
as determined by the City Engineer.
H.) Grading and Stabilization of Street Right-Of-Ways
When a new public street is proposed, all trees, brush, stumps, rocks, or other debris shall
be cleared from the street right-of-way, except in cases where trees are required to be preserved
by the Plan Review Group. All streets shall be graded to lines, grades and cross sections approved
on plans. All unsurfaced disturbed portions of street rights-of-way shall be stabilized by seeding,
fertilizing, and mulching or by another equally effective method.
Figure 2-6.08(E)

I.) Miters at Street Intersections
Where required the right-of-way miter at street intersections shall be a minimum of 25
feet, extended along either right-of-way from the street intersection, with larger miters required
for streets serving nonresidential development, as approved by the City Engineer. The minimum
pavement (curb) radius at street intersections shall be 25 feet.
J.) Street Grades
No street grade shall be less than 0.5 percent. No street grade for an arterial or collector
street shall exceed eight percent. No other local street grade shall exceed 12 percent, unless the
City Engineer finds that due to topographic conditions, a steeper grade is necessary, in which
case the street grade shall not exceed 15 percent. Grades between 12 percent and 15 percent shall
not exceed a length of 150 feet.
K.) Minimum Street Right-Of-Way and Pavement Widths
All streets shall be curbed. Street right-of-way and pavement widths shall at minimum meet the

accordance with State or City specifications. All entrances or exits of any street or driveway,
public or private, from or to any state highway shall be approved by the State Department of
Transportation and the City Engineer prior to the construction of such entrances or exits and
prior to the issuance of any land use permit or building permit for any improvement to be served
by such entrances or exits. All entrances or exits of any street or driveway, public or private, from
or to any City street shall be approved by the City Engineer prior to the construction of such
entrances or exits and prior to the issuance of any land use permit or building permit for any
improvement to be served by such entrances or exits.
B.) Curb Cut
Specifications
No curb cut or
access driveway shall be
permitted to be located
closer than 50 feet to the
nearest existing or
proposed right-of-way of
an intersecting roadway
or closer than 10 feet to a
side property line unless
the adjacent property
owner is in agreement
with the encroachment of
the driveway and
approval is obtained from the City Engineer. Curb cuts or access driveways shall be no narrower
than 20 feet from back of curb to back of curb. Strict adherence to these requirements may not
be practical in all instances as determined by the City Engineer. The City Engineer may limit the
maximum width of a curb cut and/or the number of curb cuts to a parcel as necessary when it is
deemed to be of benefit to the safety and welfare of the public.
The following factors may be considered during the review and approval of a specific
location of an entrance: the location of existing or planned median breaks; separation
requirements between the entrance and major intersections; separation requirements between
Figure 5-6.09(B)
Basically the GDOT standard for driveway spacing is distance traveled
at speed limit + reaction time + Stopping distance = ideal driveway
65
other entrances; the need to provide shared access with other sites; the need to align with
previously approved or constructed access points on the opposite side of the street; and the
minimum number of entrances needed to move traffic onto and off the site safely and efficiently.
C.) Access Along Near Divided Highways
Where a divided highway exists or is planned, the following access standards shall be met
(see Table 3-6.09 and Figure 5-6.09):
Minimum Access Separation Requirements Distance (Feet)
Curb cut of driveway from street intersection with divided highway 600
Parallel frontage road from right-of-way of divided highway 450
Curb cut or driveway on a local road from right-of-way of divided highway 200
Curb cut or driveway on a local road from state highway 200
Curb cut or driveway on parallel frontage road from local road 150
Table 3-6.09
66
Figure 6-6.09
67
D.) Interparcel Connections
New development that contains or is intended to contain more than one building or use on
site shall provide connections so that automobile trips between and among such buildings or uses
can be accomplished without using the highway or major street. Where possible and practical,
new developments and substantial improvements to existing developments shall provide for
pedestrian and automobile access connections between adjacent properties under different
ownership when the uses of the properties are of such compatibility that patrons may frequent
both buildings or uses in the same vehicle trip. (See Figure 6-6.09).
Section 6.10 Street Signs and Lighting
A.) Street Signs
Signs for street names, directions of travel, traffic control, and hazards shall be provided as
directed by the Public Works Director. Street signs for interior streets of a subdivision or land
development shall be installed at the subdivider or developers expense by the subdivider or
developer at the same time as the streets themselves are being graded and subject to the approval
of the City.
Unless otherwise provided in standards and specifications adopted by the Public Works
Director, street signs shall meet the following specifications. Signs shall be constructed of
aluminum sheets with reflective backgrounds. Information on the street name signs shall be
determined by the Public Works Director and be readable from both sides of the sign. Signs shall
be installed on a steel post. The vertical distance from the road elevation to the bottom of the
sign face shall be seven feet with a minimum burial depth of three feet.
B.) Street Lighting
The City may require that subdivisions and land developments in urban and suburban
areas provide street lighting along all public streets and along existing streets abutting the
subdivision or land development. Such street lighting if required shall meet specifications of the
City Utility Director.
68
Section 6.11 Curbs and Gutters
Curbs and gutters shall be installed for all streets in accordance with standards and
specifications of the City Engineer. All commercial and industrial subdivisions and land
developments must have curbs and gutters, regardless of the size of the lots. When property
fronting on an existing City street is subdivided or developed, and the subdivision or land
development uses said existing street for access, then curb and gutter shall be required along said
street along the entire property frontage of said street.
Section 6.12 Sidewalks
A.) When Required
Sidewalks shall be provided on all new streets, unless the Plan Review Group determines
that no current or future public need exists in a certain location. Sidewalks shall be required
when any portion of a land development or subdivision is located within one-mile of a public
school. Sidewalks are required to be installed on both sides of the street internal to a major
subdivisions. Sidewalks are not required in developments where the average lot size of the major
subdivision is two acres or more. Sidewalks may be required in minor subdivisions depending on
the specific conditions of the development, at the discretion of the Plan Review Group.
B.) Location
Sidewalks shall be included within the dedicated nonpavement right-of-way of roads and
shall parallel the street pavement as much as possible; provided, however, the City Engineer may
permit sidewalks to be designed and constructed so that they meander around permanent
obstructions or deviate from a linear pattern for design purposes.
C.) Specifications
Sidewalks shall be a minimum of five feet wide. A median strip of grassed or landscaped
areas at least four feet wide shall separate all sidewalks from adjacent curbs in residential areas.
69
Section 6.13 Drainage and Stormwater Management
A.) General Requirements
An adequate drainage system, separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system and
including any necessary ditches, pipes, culverts, intersectional drains, drop inlets, bridges, etc.,
shall be provided for the proper drainage of all surface water for all subdivisions and land
developments. Sizing and location of all drainage structures shall be the responsibility of a
registered professional engineer or land surveyor. The City Engineer may require the use of onsite
control methods such as retention or detention to mitigate the stormwater and drainage
impacts of the proposed subdivisions and land developments. The Planning Commission shall
not approve any preliminary plat of subdivision that does not make adequate provision for storm
and flood water runoff channels or basins as determined by the City Engineer. No building
permit shall be issued for any building within a subdivision or for the development of land, if
there is not present throughout the subdivision or to the land development an adequate system of
enclosed drainage and stormwater management.
B.) Waterbodies and Watercourses
If a tract being subdivided contains a water body or portion thereof, lot lines shall be so
drawn as to distribute the entire ownership of the waterbody among the adjacent lots. The City
Council may approve an alternative plan whereby the ownership of and responsibility for safe
maintenance of the waterbody is so placed that it will not become a local government
responsibility. No more then twenty-five (25) percent of the minimum area of a lot required
under the zoning ordinance may be satisfied by land that is under water. Where a watercourse
separates the buildable area of a lot from the street by which it has access, provisions shall be
made for the installation of a culvert or other structure, of design approved by the City Engineer.
C.) Method of Design and Capacity
Storm sewers, where required, shall be designed by the Rational Method, or other
methods as approved by the City Engineer, and a copy of design computations shall be submitted
along with required plans. Drainage improvements shall accommodate potential runoff from the
entire upstream drainage area within the site and shall be designed to prevent increases in
downstream flooding. Capacity for a 25-year storm or rain shall be provided for all street
70
drainage structures such as catch basin, inlets cross drains, etc. Capacity for a 100-year
frequency storm event shall be provided for all main drainage structures such as retention basins,
principal storm sewers, and all types of flood protection works.
D.) Location
Drainage facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible, and shall be
constructed in accordance with standards and specifications of the City Engineer. Catch basins
shall be located at low points of streets. Where topography or other conditions are such as to
make impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within road rights-of-way, perpetual,
unobstructed easements at least twenty (20) feet in width for drainage facilities shall be provided
across property outside the road right-of-way and with satisfactory access to the road.
E.) Discharge
Drainage shall be designed so as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from each
lot or land development site to adjacent lots, land development sites, or vacant properties. If
natural drainages cross subdivision site, efforts must be made to collect, channel and pipe the
runoff. Open drainage ditches between adjacent properties will not be permitted. If necessary
storm water runoff must be piped. Storm water shall not be discharged directly to perennial
streams. It shall be directed toward natural drainages. If water must be discharged to a stream,
the water quality flowing into the stream must meet or exceed the water quality in the receiving
waters. The water quantity flowing into the stream must be evaluated to ensure the stream
channel can accommodate the increased flows and not disrupt or degrade the ecology of the
water body.
F.) Grading and Site Drainage
Lots or land development sites shall be laid out so as to provide positive drainage away
from all buildings, and drainage for individual lots or land development sites shall be coordinated
with the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Buildings and parking lots shall be
appropriately drained so as to prevent damage to abutting properties or public streets. All
disturbed or graded ground areas of a building site not used for buildings or open storage areas
shall be appropriately stabilized and grassed or covered with plants or landscaping materials.
Inundated areas shall use subsurface drainage such as drain tile.
71
G.) Cross-Drainpipes
Where a watercourse separates the buildable area of a lot from the street by which it has
access, provisions shall be made for installation of a culvert or other structure, the design of
which shall be approved by the City Engineer. Cross-drains shall be provided to accommodate all
natural waterflow, and shall be of sufficient length to permit full-width roadways and the
required slopes. Cross drainpipes shall have head walls of an approved type on inlet and outlet
ends of the pipe. Pipe installed within the right-of-way shall be reinforced concrete pipe. All
storm drainpipes shall be minimum 18 inches in diameter. Storm sewer slopes shall be equal to
or greater than one percent.
H.) Drop Inlets
Drop inlets shall be generally three-foot by three-foot boxes with two-foot by three-foot
grates unless otherwise specified by the City Engineer.
I.) Easements
Where an irrigation ditch or channel, natural creek, stream or other drainage way crosses
a subdivision or land development, the subdivider or developer shall provide an easement
sufficient for drainage and maintenance. Easements shall be provided for all drainage facilities
as approved by the City Engineer. When a subdivision or land development is traversed by a
watercourse, drainage way, channel, or intermittent stream, a stormwater or drainage easement
of at least twenty (20) feet shall be provided.
Section 6.14 Water
A.) Generally
All habitable buildings and buildable lots shall be connected to a water system capable of
providing water for health and emergency purposes, including adequate fire protection. No
building permit shall be issued for any building within a subdivision or for the development of
land, if there is not present throughout the subdivision or to the land development an adequate
water supply as approved by Utility and Fire departments.
72
B.) Water Main Requirements
The developer shall install adequate water facilities, including fire hydrants, according to
specifications of the Utility department and the Fire department. All water mains shall be at least
eight inches in diameter and properly looped an adequate water supply of 1,000 GPM is
maintained in accordance with standards established by the Southeastern Fire Underwriters
Association, International Fire Code and Insurance Services Office. Pipe of less than four inches
shall not be used. Water lines shall be installed at least 30 inches below grade. Water mains
within subdivisions and land developments must be provided with connections to each lot in the
subdivision and each land development, except as otherwise specifically provided. (see
International Fire Code Section B105).
C.) Fire Hydrants
Fire hydrants shall be required for all nonresidential land developments and all
subdivisions. Fire hydrants with appropriate water pressure at appropriate intervals throughout
the subdivision or land development shall be provided by the subdivider or land developer as
required by the City Fire Department. Fire hydrants shall be located no more than 1,000 feet
apart and within 500 feet of any principal dwelling. Hydrants, fittings, valves and fire department
connections shall be approved by the Fire Department. Fire department connections shall be not
less than 18 inches or more than 36 inches above the finished grade of the adjoining ground or
paving. The thread of such connections shall be uniform with that used by the Fire Department.
To eliminate future street openings, all underground Utilities for fire hydrants, together with the
fire hydrants themselves, and all other supply improvements shall be installed before any final
paving of a street within the right-of-way shared by such underground Utilities. All fire water
mains and hydrants shall be installed and made serviceable prior to the construction of any
structures and shall be marked on the preliminary plat.
Section 6.15 Sewer
A.) Generally
All habitable buildings and buildable lots shall be served by an approved means of
wastewater collection and treatment. Each subdivision and land development shall be served by
73
adequate sewage disposal facilities. No building permit shall be issued for any building within a
subdivision or for the development of land, if there is not present throughout the subdivision or
to the land development an adequate system of wastewater collection and treatment.
B.) Connection to Public Sewerage System
When a public sanitary sewerage system is reasonably accessible, as determined by the
City Engineer, the subdivider or land developer shall connect with same and provide sewers
accessible to each lot in the subdivision or to each land development. If a public sanitary sewer is
reasonably accessible, it shall be unlawful for any to maintain upon any such property an
individual sewage disposal system. When a public sanitary sewerage system is not immediately
accessible but is anticipated by the City to be available within a period of three years, the
applicant shall install sanitary sewer lines, laterals, and mains from the street curb to a point in
the subdivision or land development boundary so that a future connection with the public sewer
main can be made. The City Engineer may condition the approval of a subdivision or land
development on the agreement to connect to the public sewerage system upon its availability.
Sanitary sewers shall be located within street or alley rights-of-way unless topography dictates
otherwise. No public sewer shall be less than eight inches in diameter. Manholes shall be
installed in sanitary sewers with a maximum distance between two manholes of 400 feet, unless
otherwise specified by standards of the City Engineer. Sanitary sewer slopes shall be equal to or
greater than 0.7 percent for eight inch lines. All sewer lines shall be designed with slopes to
obtain a minimum velocity of two feet per second. Minimum 20-foot wide easements shall be
provided for all sanitary sewer lines.
C.) Septic Tanks
Where individual onsite wastewater disposal systems are allowed and proposed, individual
lot sizes and shapes must exhibit appropriate regard for the peculiar health, drainage, and
maintenance characteristics on the site. Additionally, detailed soil tests may be required in order
to verify the ability of the lots to safely contain and dispose of septic system effluent. All septic
tanks and onsite wastewater disposal systems are subject to the approval of the Colquitt County
Health Department.
74
Section 6.16 Utilities
A.) Generally
All utility facilities, including but not limited to gas, electric power, telephone, and cable
television, shall be located underground throughout the subdivision or land development where
practical. Whenever existing utility facilities are located above ground, except when existing on
public roads and rights-of-way, they shall be removed and placed underground.
B.) Oversizing of Improvements and Utilities
The subdivider or land developer shall construct such oversized improvements and
Utilities that the Utility Director determines are necessary, provided that the subdivider or land
developer shall not be obligated for the additional cost of improvements and Utilities that are not
uniquely required for that development, and provided the subdivider agrees to a proposal by the
Utility Director to share in the cost arrangements for over-sizing improvements and Utilities. A
formula may be developed by the City to provide for a sharing of the cost of other improvements
needed to serve the subdivision or land development when certain of the improvements are
necessary to serve future subdivisions or developments in the vicinity.
C.) Procedure for Administrative Inspection and Acceptance of Public
Improvements
Upon completion of public improvement construction, the subdivider or land developer
shall notify the Plan Review Group and request an inspection. The City Engineer shall inspect all
public improvements and shall notify the subdivider or land developer by mail of nonacceptance
or preliminary acceptance. If the public improvements are not acceptable, the reason for nonacceptance
shall be stated and corrective measures shall be outlined in a letter of notification.
Upon notification, the subdivider or land developer shall correct all deficiencies identified in the
non-acceptance letter within the time limit established by the City Engineer. Once deficiencies
are corrected, the subdivider or land developer shall again request inspection in writing.
Acceptance of public improvements required by Section 2-2 of this code to be approved by the
local governing body shall be forwarded to the governing body by the Plan Review Group.
75
Section 6.17 Violation and Penalties
A.) Violations
1. It shall be unlawful to convey or improve property by the construction of
buildings on lots of any land subdivision which has not been approved
and recorded as provided in these regulations, except those parcels
recorded prior to the effective date of these regulations.
2. It shall be unlawful to record a subdivision plat, or once recorded, to
make any changes thereon whatsoever which have not been approved by
the Planning Commission and the Mayor and Council in accordance with
the provisions of these requirements.
3. Each Day's Violation a Separate Offense: Each and every day's violation of any
provision of this Ordinance shall constitute a separate offense.
B.) Penalties
1. Any person or persons, firm or corporation or association of persons who
shall divide and offer for sale any real estate in violation of the terms or
provisions of this Ordinance shall, upon conviction therefor in the
Recorder's Court, be punished as provided by Section 1-9, Chapter I of
the City Code.
