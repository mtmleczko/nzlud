PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the ordinances of the City of Laurel, Maryland of a general and permanent nature. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the City's 1970 Code, as supplemented through July, 1972, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parenthesis at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1970 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Numbering System 
The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the first section of Chapter 7 is 7-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three sections that would logically come between sections 1-1 and 1-2 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 1-1.1, 1-1.2 and 1-1.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included between chapters 1 and 2, it will be designated as chapter 1.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
Indices 
The indices of the Code have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by municipal officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within each index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof. 
The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
The publication of this Code was under direct supervision of George R. Langford, President, Roger D. Merriam, Supervising Editor, and Diane Johnson, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.

Sandul, Clerk to the Council for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code.

(e)  A person receiving the citation for an infraction may elect to stand trial for the offense by notifying the city in writing of his intention of standing trial. The notice shall be given at least five (5) days prior to the date of payment as set forth in the citation. Upon receipt of the citation, the district court shall schedule the case for trial and notify the defendant of the trial date. All fines, penalties, or forfeitures collected by the district court for violations of infractions shall be remitted to the city. 
(f)  If a person receiving a citation for an infraction fails to pay the fine for the infraction by the date of payment set forth on the citation and fails to file a notice of his intention to stand trial for the offense, a formal notice of the infraction shall be sent to the offender's last known address. If the citation has not been satisfied within fifteen (15) days from the date of the notice, the fine shall increase automatically and without further notice to twice the amount of the original fine, and the formal notice referred to herein shall so indicate. If after thirty-five (35) days from its issuance the citation has not been satisfied, the city may request adjudication of the case through the district court. The district court shall promptly schedule the case for trial and summon the defendant to appear. The defendant's failure to respond to such summons shall be contempt of court. 
(g)  Conviction of a municipal infraction, whether by the district court or by payment of the fine to the city, is not a criminal conviction for any purpose, nor does it impose any of the civil disabilities ordinarily imposed by a criminal conviction.

Sec. 5-1. - General provisions. 
(a)  Title. This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "City Cable Communications Regulatory Code." 
(b)  Effective date and repealer. This chapter shall take effect and be in force from and after passage. All prior ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict with the provisions of this chapter are hereby repealed. 
(c)  Findings and purpose. 
(1)  The mayor and city council of Laurel ("city") finds that the further development of cable communications may result in great benefits for the people of the city. Cable technology is rapidly changing, and cable plays an essential role as part of the city's basic infrastructure. Cable television systems occupy and extensively make use of scarce and valuable public rights-of-way, in a manner different from the way in which the general public uses them, and in a manner reserved primarily for those who provide essential services to the public subject to special public interest obligations, such as utility companies. The city finds that public convenience, safety, and general welfare can best be served by establishing regulatory powers vested in the city or such persons as the city so designates to protect the public and to ensure that any franchise granted is operated in the public interest. 
(2)  Further, it is recognized that cable systems have the capacity to provide not only entertainment and information services to the city's residents, but can provide a variety of broadband, interactive communications services to institutions and individuals. 
(3)  In light of the foregoing, the following goals, among others, underlie the provisions set forth in this chapter: 
a.  Cable service should be available to as many city residents as possible. 
b.  A cable system should be capable of accommodating both present and reasonably foreseeable future cable-related needs of the city. 
c.  A cable system should be constructed and maintained during a franchise term so that changes in technology may be integrated to the maximum extent possible into existing system facilities. 
d.  A cable system should be responsive to the needs and interests of the local community, and shall provide a diversity of information sources and service to the public. 
e.  A cable operator should pay fair compensation to the city for the use of local public rights-of-way. 
(4)  The city intends that all provisions set forth in this chapter be construed to serve the public interest and the foregoing public purposes, and that any franchise issued pursuant to this chapter be construed to include the foregoing findings and public purposes as integral parts thereof. 
(d)  Delegation of powers. The city may delegate the performance of any act, duty, or obligation, or the exercise of any power, under this chapter or any franchise agreement to any employee, officer, department or agency, except where prohibited by applicable law.

(2)  Franchises shall be granted by action of the council pursuant to applicable law. 
(3)  No person may construct or operate a cable system without a franchise granted by the city. No person may be granted a franchise without having entered into a franchise agreement with the city pursuant to this chapter. 
(b)  Term of franchise. No franchise shall be granted for a period of more than fifteen (15) years, except that franchisee may apply for renewal or extension pursuant to applicable law. 
(c)  Franchise characteristics. 
(1)  A franchise authorizes use of public rights-of-way for installing cables, wires, lines, optical fiber, underground conduit, and other devices necessary and appurtenant to the operation of a cable system to provide cable service within a franchise area, but does not expressly or implicitly authorize a franchisee to provide service to, or install a cable system on, private property without owner consent (except for use of compatible easements pursuant to Section 621 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 541(a)(2) and common law), or to use publicly or privately owned conduits without a separate agreement with the owners. 
(2)  A franchise shall constitute both a right and an obligation to provide the cable services regulated by the provisions of this Chapter and the franchise agreement. 
(3)  A franchise is non-exclusive and will not explicitly or implicitly preclude the issuance of other franchises to operate cable systems within the city; affect the city's right to authorize use of public rights-of-way by other persons to operate cable systems or for other purposes as it determines appropriate; or affect the city's right to itself construct, operate, or maintain a cable system, with or without a franchise. 
(4)  All privileges prescribed by a franchise shall be subordinate to (without limitation) the city's use and any prior lawful occupancy of the public rights-of-way. 
(5)  The city reserves the right to reasonably designate where a franchisee's facilities are to be placed within the public rights-of-way and to resolve any disputes among users of the public rights-of-way. 
(d)  Franchisee subject to other laws, police power. 
(1)  A franchisee shall at all times be subject to and shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws. A franchisee shall at all times be subject to all lawful exercise of the police power of the city, including all rights the city may have under 47 U.S.C. § 552. Nothing in a franchise agreement shall be deemed to waive the requirements of the various codes and ordinances of the city regarding permits, fees to be paid, or manner of construction. 
(2)  No course of dealing between a franchisee and the city, or any delay on the part of the city in exercising any rights hereunder, or any acquiescence by the city in the actions of a franchisee that are in contravention of such rights (except to the extent such rights are expressly waived by the city) shall operate as a waiver of any such rights of the city. 
(3)  The city may, from time to time, issue such reasonable rules and regulations concerning cable systems as are consistent with applicable law. 
(e)  Interpretation of franchise terms. 
(1)  The provisions of this chapter and any franchise agreement will be liberally construed in favor of the city in order to effectuate their purposes and objectives and to promote the public interest. 
(2)  Subject to federal law or regulation, a franchise agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland. 
(f)  Operation of a cable system without a franchise. Any person who occupies the public rights-of-way of the city for the purpose of operating or constructing a cable system or an OVS and who does not hold a valid franchise (or other authority allowing such entity to be in the public rights-of-way to provide video services) from the city shall nonetheless, to the extent allowable by law, be subject to all provisions of this chapter, including but not limited to its provisions regarding construction and technical standards and franchise fees. Such person shall apply for a franchise within thirty (30) days of receipt of a written notice by the city that a franchise agreement is required. The city may, in its discretion, require such person to remove its property and restore the area to a condition satisfactory to the city within a reasonable time period, as the city shall determine; remove the property itself and restore the area to a satisfactory condition and charge the person the costs therefor; and/or take any other action it is entitled to take under applicable law, including filing for and seeking damages under trespass. In no event shall a franchise be created unless it is issued by action of the city and subject to a written franchise agreement. 
(g)  Acts at franchisee's expense. Any act that a franchisee is or may be required to perform under this chapter, a franchise agreement, or applicable law, including but not limited to removal, replacement, or modification of the installation of any of its facilities and restoration to city standards and specifications of any damage or disturbance caused to the public rights-of-way as a result of its operations or construction on its behalf, shall be performed at the franchisee's expense, unless expressly provided to the contrary in this chapter, the franchise agreement, or applicable law. 
(h)  Eminent domain. Nothing herein shall be deemed or construed to impair or affect, in any way or to any extent, the city's rights of eminent domain to the extent to which they may apply to any public utility or cable system. 
(Ord. No. 1309, 3-22-99)  
Sec. 5-4. - Franchise applications. 
(a)  Application required. 
(1)  A written application shall be filed with the city for grant of an initial franchise or modification of a franchise agreement pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 545. 
(2)  To be acceptable for filing, a signed original of the application shall be submitted together with twelve (12) copies. The application must be accompanied by any required application filing fee, conform to any applicable request for proposals, and contain all required information. All applications shall include the names and addresses of persons authorized to act on behalf of all applicants with respect to the application. 
(3)  All applications accepted for filing shall be made available by the city for public inspection. 
(b)  Application for grant of an initial franchise. 
(1)  A person may apply for an initial franchise by submitting an application containing the information required in subsection 5-4(c). Upon receipt of such an application, the city may either (a) evaluate the application pursuant to subsection 5-4(b)(3), conducting such investigations as it deems necessary; or (b) issue a request for proposals ("RFP"), after conducting, if necessary, a proceeding to identify the future cable-related needs and interests of the community. Any such RFP shall be mailed to the person requesting its issuance and made available to any other interested party. The RFP may contain a proposed franchise agreement. 
(2)  An applicant shall respond to a RFP by filing an application within the time directed by the city, providing the information and material set forth in subsection 5-4(c). The procedures, instructions, and requirements set forth in the RFP shall be followed by each applicant. Any applicant that has already filed materials pursuant to subsection 5-4(b)(1) herein need not refile the same materials with its RFP response, but must amplify its application to include any additional or different materials required by the RFP. The city or its designee may seek additional information from any applicant and establish deadlines for the submission of such information. 
(3)  In evaluating an application for a franchise, the city shall consider, among other things, the following factors: 
a.  The extent to which the applicant has substantially complied with the applicable law and the material terms of any existing cable franchise for the city; 
b.  Whether the quality of the applicant's service under any existing franchise in the city, including signal quality, response to customer complaints, billing practices, and the like, has been reasonable in light of the needs and interests of the communities served; 
c.  Whether the applicant has the financial, technical, and legal qualifications to provide cable service; 
d.  Whether the application satisfies any minimum requirements established by the city and is otherwise reasonable to meet the future cable-related needs and interests of the community, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and interests; 
e.  Whether, to the extent not considered under section 5-4(b)(3)d., the applicant will provide adequate public, educational, and governmental access channel capacity, facilities, or financial support; 
f.  Whether issuance of a franchise is warranted in the public interest considering the immediate and future effect on the public rights-of-way and private property that would be used by the cable system, including the extent to which installation or maintenance as planned would require replacement of property or involve disruption of property, public services, or use of the public rights-of-way; the effect of granting a franchise on the ability of cable to meet the cable-related needs and interests of the community; and the comparative superiority or inferiority of competing applications. 
g.  What effects a grant of the application may have on competition in the delivery of cable service in the city. 
(4)  If the city finds that it is in the public interest to issue a franchise considering without limitation the factors set forth above, and subject to the applicant's entry into an appropriate franchise agreement, it shall issue a franchise. If the city denies a franchise, it will issue a written decision explaining why the franchise was denied. Prior to deciding whether or not to issue a franchise, the city may hold one or more public hearings or implement other procedures under which comments from the public on an application may be received. The city also may grant or deny a request for a franchise based on its review of an application without further proceedings and may reject any application that is incomplete or falls to respond to an RFP. This chapter is not intended and shall not be interpreted to grant any party standing to challenge the denial of an application or the issuance of a franchise unless such standing is necessary to enforce a party's rights under its franchise agreement or applicable law. 
(c)  Contents of application. An RFP for the grant of an initial franchise shall require, and any such application shall contain, at a minimum, the following information: 
(1)  Name and address of the applicant and identification of the ownership and control of the applicant, including: the names and addresses of the ten (10) largest holders of an ownership interest in the applicant and affiliates of the applicant, and all persons with five (5) per cent or more ownership interest in the applicant and its affiliates; the persons who control the applicant and its affiliates; all officers and directors of the applicant and its affiliates; and any other business affiliation and cable system ownership interest of each named person.

b.  The applicant must have the necessary authority under Maryland law to operate a cable system. 
c.  The applicant must have the necessary authority under federal law to hold the franchise and operate a cable system. An applicant must have, or show that it is qualified to obtain, any necessary federal franchises or waivers required to operate the system proposed. 
d.  The city shall consider whether, at any time during the ten (10) years preceding the submission of the application, the applicant was convicted of any act or omission of such character that the applicant cannot be relied upon to deal truthfully with the city and the subscribers of the cable system, or to substantially comply with its lawful obligations under applicable law, including obligations under consumer protection laws and laws prohibiting anti-competitive acts, fraud, racketeering, or other similar conduct. 
e.  The city shall consider whether an applicant files materially misleading information in its application or intentionally withholds information that the applicant lawfully is required to provide. 
f.  The city shall consider whether any elected official of the city holds a controlling interest in the applicant or an affiliate of the applicant. 
The city shall provide an opportunity to an applicant to show that it would be inappropriate to deny it a franchise by virtue of the particular circumstances surrounding the matter and the steps taken by the applicant to cure all harms flowing therefrom and prevent their recurrence, the lack of involvement of the applicant's principals, or the remoteness of the matter from the operation of cable systems. 
(4)  A demonstration of financial qualifications to complete the construction and operation of the cable system proposed. 
(5)  A description of any prior experience in cable system ownership, construction and operation, and identification of communities in which the applicant or any of its principals have, or have had, a cable franchise or any interest therein.

(14)  The city may, at its discretion and upon request of an applicant, waive in writing the provision of any of the information required by this section 5-4(c). 
(d)  Application for grant of a renewal franchise. The renewal of any franchise to provide cable service shall be conducted in a manner consistent with Section 626 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546, as from time to time amended. 
(e)  Application for modification of a franchise. An application for modification of a franchise agreement shall include, at minimum, the following information:

(f)  Public hearings. An applicant shall be notified of any public hearings held in connection with the evaluation of its application and shall be given an opportunity to be heard. In addition, prior to the issuance of a franchise, the city shall provide for the holding of a public hearing within the proposed franchise area, following reasonable notice to the public, at which every applicant and its applications shall be examined and the public and all interested parties afforded a reasonable opportunity to be heard. 
(g)  Acceptance of franchise. Following approval by the city, any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter, and the rights, privileges and authority granted by a franchise agreement, shall take effect and be in force from and after the first date on which both the franchisee and the city have accepted and signed the franchise agreement. 
(Ord. No. 1309, 3-22-99)

(Ord. No. 1309, 3-22-99; Ord. No. 1480, 12-12-05)  
Sec. 5-6. - Provision of cable service. 
(a)  Availability of cable service. A franchisee shall construct and operate its system so as to provide service to all parts of its franchise area having a density of at least twenty (20) residences per mile of system. In addition, all areas which reach such density at any time during the franchise term shall be provided service upon reaching the minimum density. 
(b)  Line extension requirement. Except as federal law may otherwise require, and subject to the minimum density requirement specified in subsection (a), a franchisee shall, upon request: (i) extend its trunk and distribution system to any subscriber located within two hundred fifty (250) feet of a main distribution cable located in the public rights-of-way at its standard installation charge, unless the franchisee demonstrates to the city's satisfaction that extraordinary circumstances exist; and (ii) extend its trunk and distribution system to any potential subscriber outside the two hundred fifty-foot limit, provided that the franchisee may charge the potential subscriber for the cost of the actual length of the installed drop, or the shortest distance to the point where the franchisee would be required to extend its distribution system, whichever is shorter, except where the franchisee has demonstrated to the city's satisfaction that extraordinary circumstances exist. In areas where the minimum density requirement is not met, or where extraordinary circumstances exist, a franchisee shall, upon request, extend its cable system to a potential subscriber, provided that the subscriber shall pay the additional extension costs. 
(c)  Cost sharing. 
(1)  "Additional extension costs" as used in subsection (b) herein shall mean a subscriber's pro rata share of a franchisee's total construction costs at the actual density of affected potential subscribers, less the total construction costs that the franchisee would incur if it were extending its system to make service available to the same number of potential subscribers at a density of twenty (20) residences per mile. 
(2)  "Total construction costs" are defined for purposes of this subsection (c) as the actual turnkey cost to construct the entire extension including electronics, pole make-ready charges, and labor, but not the cost of the house drop. 
(d)  Continuity of service. 
(1)  It is the right of all subscribers in the franchise area to receive all available services from a franchisee, as those services become available, as long as their financial and other obligations to the franchisee are satisfied. 
(2)  A franchisee shall ensure that all subscribers receive continuous uninterrupted service. At the city's request, a franchisee shall, as trustee for its successor in interest, operate its system for a temporary period (the "transition period") following the termination, sale, or transfer of its franchise as necessary to maintain service to subscribers, and shall cooperate with the city to assure an orderly transition from it to another franchisee. 
(3)  During such transition period, a franchisee shall not sell any of the system assets, nor make any physical, material, administrative or operational change that would tend to reduce the quality of service to subscribers, decrease the system's income, or materially increase expenses without the express permission, in writing, of the city. 
(4)  The city may seek legal and/or equitable relief to enforce the provisions of this section. 
(5)  The transition period shall be no longer than the reasonable period required to ensure that cable service will be available to subscribers, and shall not be longer than thirty-six (36) months, unless extended by the city for good cause. During the transition period, a franchisee will continue to be obligated to comply with the terms and conditions of the agreement and applicable laws and regulations. 
(6)  If a franchisee abandons its system during the franchise term, or fails to operate its system in accordance with the terms of its franchise agreement during any transition period, the city, at its option, may operate the system, designate another entity to operate the system temporarily until the franchisee restores service under conditions acceptable to the city or until the franchise is revoked and a new franchisee selected by the city is providing service, or obtain an injunction requiring the franchisee to continue operations. If the city is required to operate or designate another entity to operate the cable system, the franchisee shall reimburse the city or its designee for all reasonable costs and damages incurred that are in excess of the revenues from the cable system. 
(7)  A franchisee shall forfeit its rights to notice and hearing, and the council may by resolution declare its franchise immediately terminated, in addition to any other relief or remedies it may have under its franchise agreement, this chapter, or other applicable law, if: 
a.  The franchisee fails to provide cable service in accordance with its franchise over a substantial portion of the franchise area for ninety-six (96) consecutive hours, unless the city authorizes a longer interruption of service or the failure is due to force majeure as characterized in its franchise agreement; or 
b.  The franchisee, for any period, willfully and without cause refuses to provide cable service in accordance with its franchise over a substantial portion of the franchise area. 
(Ord. No. 1309, 3-22-99)  
Sec. 5-7. - Design and construction. 
(a)  System construction schedule. Every franchise agreement shall specify the construction schedule that will apply to any required construction, upgrade, or rebuild of the cable system. 
(b)  Construction procedures. 
(1)  A franchisee shall construct, operate and maintain its cable system in strict compliance with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations, including but not limited to the National Electrical Safety Code and the National Fire Protection Association National Electrical Code, as such may be amended from time to time. 
(2)  The system, and all parts thereof, shall be subject to the right of periodic inspection by the city. 
(3)  No construction, reconstruction, installation, or relocation of the system or any part thereof within the public rights-of-way shall be commenced until all applicable written permits have been obtained from the proper city officials. In any permit so issued, such officials may impose such conditions and regulations as a condition of the granting of the permit as are necessary for the purpose of protecting any structures in the public rights-of-way and for the proper restoration of such public rights-of-way and structures, and for the protection of the public and the continuity of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. 
(4)  A franchisee shall, by a time specified by the city, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate, or remove any of its property when required by the city by reason of; traffic conditions; public safety; public right-of-way construction; public right-of-way maintenance or repair (including resurfacing or widening); change of public right-of-way grade; construction, installation or repair of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal lines, tracks, or any other type of government-owned communications system, public work or improvement or any government-owned utility; public-right-of-way vacation; or for any other purpose where the convenience of the city would be served thereby; provided, however, that a franchisee shall, in all such cases, have the privilege of abandoning any property in place, after obtaining permission from the city. 
(5)  If any removal, relaying, or relocation is required to accommodate the construction, operation, or repair of the facilities of another person that is authorized to use the public rights-of-way, a franchisee shall, after reasonable advance written notice, take action to effect the necessary changes requested by the responsible entity. The city may resolve disputes as to responsibility for costs associated with the removal, relaying, or relocation of facilities as among entities authorized to install facilities in the public rights-of-way if the parties are unable to do so themselves, and if the matter is not governed by a valid contract between the parties or a state or federal law or regulation. 
(6)  In the event of an emergency, or where a cable system creates or is contributing to an imminent danger to health, safety, or property, the city may remove, relay, or relocate any or all parts of that cable system without prior notice. 
(7)  A franchisee shall, on the request of any person holding a building moving permit issued by the city, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of buildings. The expense of such temporary removal or raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the person requesting same, and a franchisee shall have the authority to require such payment in advance, except in the case where the requesting person is the city, in which case no such payment shall be required. A franchisee shall be given not less than seventy-two (72) hours' advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire changes. 
(8)  A franchisee shall participate in any "Ms. Utility" program active in its franchise area with regard to giving and receiving notice of the location of facilities and excavations. 
(c)  Restoration. Any and all public rights-of-way, public property or private property that is disturbed or damaged during the construction, repair, replacement, relocation, operation, maintenance or construction of a cable system shall be repaired, replaced and restored, as appropriate, in substantially the same condition and in a good workmanlike, timely manner, in accordance with the standards for such work set by the city. With respect to damage or disturbances to public rights-of-way or public property, all repairs and restoration shall be performed in accordance with applicable law. All repairs, replacements and restoration shall be undertaken within no more than thirty (30) days after the damage is incurred, and shall be completed as soon as reasonably possible thereafter. A franchisee shall guarantee and maintain such restoration for at least one (1) year against defective materials or workmanship. 
(d)  Use of public property. 
(1)  Should the grades or lines of the public rights-of-way that the franchisee is authorized by a franchise to use and occupy be changed at any time during the term of a franchise, the franchisee shall, if necessary, relocate or change its system so as to conform with the new grades or lines. 
(2)  Any alteration to the water mains, sewerage or drainage system or to any city, state or other public structures in the public rights-of-way required on account of the presence of a franchisee's system in the public rights-of-way shall be made at the sole cost and expense of the franchisee. During any work of constructing, operating or maintaining of a system, the franchisee shall also protect any and all existing structures belonging to the city and any other person. All work performed by the franchisee shall be done in the manner prescribed by the city or other officials having jurisdiction therein. 
(e)  Interference with public projects. Nothing in this chapter or any franchise agreement shall be in preference or hindrance to the right of the city and any board, authority, commission or public service corporation to perform or carry on any public works or public improvements of any description, and should a franchisee's system in any way interfere with the construction, maintenance or repair of such public works or public improvements, the franchisee shall protect or relocate its system, or part thereof, as reasonably directed by any city official, board, authority, commission or public service corporation. 
(Ord. No. 1309, 3-22-99)  
Sec. 5-8. - Channels and facilities for public, educational and governmental use. 
(a)  Management of channels. The city may designate one (1) or more entities, including a non-profit access management corporation, to perform any or all of the following functions: 
(1)  To manage any necessary scheduling or allocation of capacity on the Institutional Network; and/or 
(2)  On the city's behalf, to program any public, educational, or governmental access channel. 
Educational and public access channels shall not be managed by the same entity, provided, however, that until such entities have been designated, the city shall be responsible for these functions. 
(b)  Public access programming rules. For any public access channel, the entity managing such channel shall establish (i) rules that prohibit the presentation of any advertising material designed to promote the sale of commercial products or services (including advertising by or on behalf of candidates for public office), lottery information, and obscene matter; (ii) rules requiring first-come, nondiscriminatory access; and (iii) rules permitting public inspection of the complete record of the names and addresses of all persons and groups requesting access time. Such a record shall be retained for a period of two (2) years.

(Ord. No. 1309, 3-22-99)  
Sec. 5-9. - Consumer protection. 
(a)  General provisions. This section 5-9 sets forth customer service standards that a franchisee must satisfy. In addition, the franchisee shall at all times satisfy any additional or stricter requirements established by FCC regulations, or other applicable federal, state, or local law or regulation, as the same may be amended from time to time. 
(1)  Nothing in this chapter may be construed to prevent or prohibit: 
a.  The city and a franchisee from agreeing to customer service requirements that exceed the standards set forth in this chapter; 
b.  The city from enforcing, through the end of a franchise term, pre-existing customer service requirements that exceed the standards set forth in this chapter and are contained in current franchise agreements; 
c.  The city from enacting or enforcing any customer service or consumer protection laws or regulations; or 
d.  The city from waiving, for good cause, requirements established in this section 5-9. 
(2)  Nothing in this chapter in any way relieves a franchisee of its obligation to comply with other applicable consumer protection laws and its franchise agreement. 
(b)  Installations, connections, and other franchisee services. 
(1)  Installation of drops. A subscriber's preference as to the point of entry into a residence shall be observed whenever feasible. Runs in building interiors shall be as unobtrusive as possible. A franchisee shall use due care in the process of installation and shall repair any damage to a subscriber's property caused by said installation. Such restoration shall be undertaken within thirty (30) days after the damage is incurred and shall be completed as soon as reasonably possible thereafter. 
(2)  Location of drops. In locations where a franchisee's system must be underground, drops must be placed underground as well. In all cases where new developments and subdivisions are to be constructed and to be served in whole or in part by underground power and telephone utilities, the owner or developer of such areas shall provide reasonable notice to the franchisee of the availability of trenches, backfill and specifications of all necessary substructures in order that the franchisee may install all necessary cable facilities. In no event shall such undergrounding be at any cost or expense to the city. 
(3)  Time for extension/installation. Where a franchisee is required under section 5-6 to provide service to a person that resides within two hundred fifty (250) feet from the franchisee's distribution system, the franchisee must provide such service within seven (7) business days of the person's request. If the person resides more than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet from the franchisee's distribution system, the city may waive this seven-day requirement upon a showing of good cause by the franchisee and provided the franchisee specifies the time period within which service will be provided. This standard shall be met ninety-five (95) per cent of the time, measured on a quarterly basis. 
(4)  Antennas and antenna switches. A franchisee shall adhere to FCC regulations regarding antenna switches. A franchisee shall not, as a condition to providing cable service, require any subscriber or potential subscriber to remove any existing antenna structures for the receipt of over-the-air television signals. 
(5)  Delinquent accounts. A franchisee shall use its best efforts to collect on delinquent subscriber accounts before terminating service. In all cases, the franchisee shall provide the customer with at least ten (10) working days written notice prior to disconnection. 
(c)  Telephone and office availability. 
(1)  Each franchisee shall maintain offices at convenient locations within Prince George's County, as specified in its franchise agreement, that shall be open during normal business hours to allow subscribers to request service, pay bills, and conduct other business. 
(2)  Each franchisee will maintain at least one (1) local, toll-free or collect call telephone access line which will be available to subscribers twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week. Trained representatives of a franchisee shall be available to respond to subscriber telephone inquiries during normal business hours. 
(3)  Each franchisee shall be subject to the following standards, except that such franchisee shall not be subject to penalty as long as it meets such standards under normal operating conditions at least ninety (90) per cent of the time, measured quarterly: 
a.  Telephone answering time shall not exceed thirty (30) seconds, and the time to transfer the call to a customer service representative (including hold time) shall not exceed an additional thirty (30) seconds. 
b.  A customer will receive a busy signal less than three (3) per cent of the time. 
c.  When the business office is closed, an answering service where a person receives and records service complaints and inquiries shall be employed. Inquiries received after hours must be responded to by a trained representative of a franchisee on the next business day. To the extent possible, the after-hours answering service shall comply with the same telephone answer time standard set forth in this section. 
(4)  In any case, at all times a franchisee shall provide an answering machine so that callers will have the option to leave messages. 
(5)  A franchisee must hire sufficient competent customer service representatives and repair technicians so that it can adequately respond to customer inquiries, complaints, and requests for service in its office, over the phone, and at a subscriber's residence; provide prompt and effective service to subscribers; and, as a rule, complete repairs within a subscriber's home upon a single visit. 
(d)  Scheduling and completing service. Under normal operating conditions, each of the following standards shall be met by all franchisees at least ninety-five (95) per cent of the time, as measured on a quarterly basis: 
(1)  Prompt service. Excluding conditions beyond the control of the franchisee, repairs and maintenance for service interruptions must begin promptly and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after the subscriber reports the problem to the franchisee or its representative or the interruption or need for repairs otherwise becomes known to the franchisee. All such work must be completed within three (3) days from the date of the initial request, except installation requests, provided that a franchisee shall complete the work in the shortest time possible where, for reasons beyond the franchisee's control, the work could not be completed in those time periods even with the exercise of all due diligence; the failure of a franchisee to hire sufficient staff or to properly train its staff shall not justify a franchisee's failure to comply with this provision. 
(2)  Service times. Each franchisee shall perform service calls, installations, and disconnects at least during normal business hours. In addition, maintenance service capability enabling the prompt location and correction of major system malfunctions shall be available Monday through Friday from the end of normal business hours until 12:30 a.m., and from 8:00 a.m. until 12:30 a.m. on Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays. 
(3)  Appointments. The appointment window for installations, service calls, and other installation activities will be either a specific time or, at maximum, a two-hour time block during normal business hours, or such greater time as the city may authorize. Where a subscriber cannot conveniently arrange for a service call or installation during normal business hours, a franchisee shall also schedule service and installation calls outside normal business hours for the express convenience of the subscriber. 
(4)  Cancellations. A franchisee may not cancel an appointment with a subscriber after the close of business on the business day preceding the appointment. If a franchisee's representative is running late for an appointment with a subscriber and will not be able to keep the appointment as scheduled, the subscriber will be contacted, and the appointment rescheduled, as necessary, at a time which is convenient for the subscriber. 
(5)  Emergency maintenance. A franchisee shall keep an emergency system maintenance and repair staff, capable of responding to and repairing system malfunctions or interruptions, on a twenty-four-hour basis. 
(6)  Other inquiries. Under normal operating conditions, billing inquiries and requests for service, repair, and maintenance not involving service interruptions must be acknowledged by a trained customer service representative within twenty-four (24) hours, or prior to the end of the next business day, whichever is earlier. A franchisee shall respond to all other inquiries within five (5) business days of the inquiry or complaint. 
(7)  If a subscriber experiences a missed appointment due to the fault of a franchisee, the franchisee shall credit the subscriber's account twenty dollars ($20.00) for each missed appointment, or grant the subscriber such other equivalent remedy as the subscriber and franchisee may agree. This is in addition to any other penalties or liquidated damages. 
(8)  Upon subscriber request, each franchisee shall arrange for pickup and/or replacement of converters or other franchisee equipment at the subscriber's address or by a satisfactory equivalent (such as the provision of a postage-prepaid mailer). At a subscriber's request, a franchisee shall make such pickup or replacement at the same time as any disconnection or other related service call, so as to avoid an additional visit. If a franchisee charges a fee for such pickup or replacement, such fee shall be clearly disclosed at the time of the subscriber's request. 
(e)  Interruptions of service. 
(1)  A franchisee shall, when practicable, schedule and conduct maintenance on its cable system so that interruption of service is minimized and occurs during periods of minimum subscriber use of the cable system. The franchisee shall provide reasonable prior notice to subscribers and the city before interrupting service for planned maintenance or construction, except where such interruption is expected to be one hour or less in duration. Such notice shall be provided by methods reasonably calculated to give subscribers actual notice of the planned interruption. 
(2)  A franchisee may intentionally interrupt service on the cable system after 7:00 a.m. and before 1:00 a.m. only with good cause and for the shortest time possible and, except in emergency situations, only after publishing notice of service interruption at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance of the service interruption. Service may be intentionally interrupted between 1:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. for routine testing, maintenance, and repair, without notification, any night except Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, or the night preceding a holiday. 
(f)  Notice to subscribers. 
(1)  Unless otherwise provided for herein, a franchisee shall provide the following materials to each subscriber at the time cable service is installed, at least annually thereafter, and at any time upon request. Copies of all such materials provided to subscribers shall also be provided to the city. 
a.  A written description of products and services offered, including a schedule of rates and charges, a list of channel positions, and a description of programming services, options, and conditions; 
b.  A written description of the franchisee's installation and service maintenance policies, delinquent subscriber disconnect and reconnect procedures, and any other of its policies applicable to its subscribers; 
c.  Written instructions on how to use the cable service; 
d.  Written instructions for placing a service call; 
e.  A written description of the franchisee's billing and complaint procedures, including the address and telephone number of the city office responsible for receiving subscriber complaints; 
f.  A copy of the service contract, if any (at installation or on request, but need not be provided annually); 
g.  Notice regarding subscribers' privacy rights pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 551; and 
h.  Notice of the availability of universal remote controls and other compatible equipment (a list of which, specifying brands and models, shall be provided to any subscriber upon request). 
(2)  Subscribers will be notified of any changes in rates, programming services or channel positions, and any significant changes in any other information required to be provided by this section, as soon as possible in writing, unless such notice is waived by operation of applicable law. Notice must be given to subscribers a minimum of thirty (30) days in advance of such changes if the change is within the control of the cable operator. Notwithstanding the above, a cable operator shall not be required to provide prior notice of any rate change that is the result of a regulatory fee, franchise fee, or any other fee, tax, assessment, or charge of any kind imposed by any federal agency, state, or franchising authority on the transaction between the operator and the subscriber. 
(3)  All franchisee promotional materials, announcements, and advertising of residential cable service to subscribers and the general public, where price information is listed in any manner, shall clearly and accurately disclose price terms. In the case of pay-per-view or pay-per-event programming, all promotional materials must clearly and accurately disclose price terms and in the case of telephone orders, a franchisee shall take appropriate steps to ensure that price terms are clearly and accurately disclosed to potential customers before the order is accepted. 
(4)  Copies of all notices provided to subscribers under these customer service standards, as well as all promotional or special offers made to subscribers, and of any agreements used with subscribers, shall be filed promptly with the city. 
(g)  Billing. 
(1)  Bills shall be clear, concise, and understandable. Bills must be fully itemized with itemizations including, but not limited to, basic service, cable programming service, and premium service charges and all equipment charges. Bills shall clearly delineate all activity during the billing period, including optional charges, rebates, and credits. 
(2)  Refund checks to subscribers shall be issued promptly, but no later than the later of: 
a.  The subscriber's next billing cycle, or thirty (30) days, following resolution of the refund request, whichever is earlier; or 
b.  The return of all equipment supplied by the franchisee, if service is terminated. 
(3)  Credits for service shall be issued no later than the subscriber's next billing cycle following the determination that a credit is warranted. 
(4)  A franchisee's first billing statement after a new installation or service change shall be prorated as appropriate and shall reflect any security deposit. 
(5)  Late fees will not be assessed for payments after the due date until forty-five (45) days after the beginning of the service period for which the payment is to be rendered. In addition, subscribers will receive the benefit of any change in the late fee amount, and of any increases in the time allowed before assessment of late fees, that may result from litigation over late fees pending as of the effective date of this chapter. 
(6)  A franchisee must notify the subscriber that he or she can remit payment in person at the franchisee's business office and inform the subscriber of the address of that office. 
(7)  Subscribers shall not be charged a late fee or otherwise penalized for any failure by a franchisee, including failure to timely or correctly bill the subscriber, or failure to properly credit the subscriber for a payment timely made. 
(8)  A subscriber who asks a franchisee for credit for an outage shall receive credit for the actual time period of the outage as a pro rata fraction of the monthly charges for any outage lasting between two (2) and six (6) hours, without reference to the time the subscriber contacts the franchisee. A subscriber shall receive credit for one (1) full day's monthly charges for any outage of between six (6) and twenty-four (24) hours, whether or not the subscriber reports such an outages, if the franchisee becomes aware of such outages, either through reports by subscribers or otherwise. Each franchisee shall place a message in subscribers' bills at least quarterly, explaining how to report an outage, how to obtain a credit, and under what conditions credits are available. A franchisee shall also establish a mechanism by which subscribers may reliably and immediately contact the franchisee by telephone and report an outage for credit purposes, either by ensuring that they can reliably and immediately reach a live person or by another method (for example, by leaving a voice message or entering the subscriber's telephone number). Upon receiving such reports, the franchisee shall promptly contact the subscriber to confirm that the report has been received, and apply the credit to the subscriber's bill unless the franchisee reasonably concludes that the subscriber's report is false. 
(9)  Franchisee shall respond to all written billing complaints from subscribers within thirty (30) days. 
(h)  Disconnection/downgrades. 
(1)  A subscriber may terminate service at any time. 
(2)  A franchisee shall promptly disconnect or downgrade any subscriber. No period of notice prior to voluntary termination or downgrade of service may be required of subscribers by any franchisee. So long as the subscriber returns, or permits the franchisee to retrieve, any equipment necessary to receive a service within five (5) business days of the disconnection, no charge may be imposed by any franchisee for any cable service delivered after the date of the disconnect request. 
(3)  A subscriber may be asked, but not required, to disconnect a franchisee's equipment and return it to the business office. 
(4)  Any funds due the subscriber shall be refunded on disconnected accounts after any customer premises equipment provided by the franchisee has been recovered by the franchisee. The refund must be made within thirty (30) days or by the end of the next billing cycle, whichever is earlier, from the date disconnection was requested (or, if later, the date on which any customer premises equipment provided by the franchisee is returned). 
(5)  If a subscriber fails to pay a monthly subscriber fee or other fee or charge, a franchisee may disconnect the subscriber's service; however, such disconnection shall not be effected until at least forty-five (45) days after the bill is due, plus at least ten (10) days' advance written notice to the subscriber in question of intent to disconnect, but in no event before the date when the franchisee would be entitled to charge a late fee. If the subscriber pays all amounts due, including late charges, before the date scheduled for disconnection, the franchisee shall not disconnect service. After disconnection, upon payment by the subscriber in full of all proper fees or charges, including the payment of the reconnection charge, if any, the franchisee shall promptly reinstate service. 
(6)  A franchisee may immediately disconnect a subscriber if the subscriber is damaging or destroying the franchisee's cable system or equipment. After disconnection, the franchisee shall restore service after the subscriber provides adequate assurance that it has ceased the practices that led to disconnection, and paid all proper fees and charges, including any reconnect fees and amounts owed the franchisee for damage to its cable system or equipment. 
(7)  A franchisee may also disconnect a subscriber that causes signal leakage in excess of federal limits. A franchisee may disconnect a subscriber without notice where signal leakage is detected originating from the subscriber's premises in excess of federal limits, provided that the franchisee shall immediately notify the subscriber of the problem and, once the problem is corrected, reconnect the subscriber. 
(8)  The disposition of cable home wiring in residential single-family homes shall be governed by FCC rules regarding cable home wiring as of December 1, 1998. 
(9)  A franchisee shall reconnect service to customers wishing restoration of service, provided such a customer shall first satisfy any previous obligations owed. 
(i)  Changes in service. 
(1)  At the time a franchisee alters the service it provides to a class of subscribers, it must provide each subscriber thirty (30) days' notice, explain the substance and full effect of the alteration, and provide the subscriber the right to opt to receive any combination of services thereafter offered by franchisee. 
(2)  No charge may be made for any service or product that the subscriber has not affirmatively indicated it wishes to receive. 
(j)  Parental control option. A franchisee shall make available to any subscribers upon request the option of blocking the video or audio portion of any channel or channels of programming entering the subscriber's home. The control option described herein shall be made available to all subscribers requesting it when any cable service is provided, or reasonably soon thereafter. 
(k)  Enforcement. 
(1)  A franchisee shall keep such records as are necessary to show compliance with these customer service standards and FCC customer service standards. 
(2)  The city shall have the right to observe and inspect a franchisee's customer service procedures. 
(3)  Except as prohibited by federal law, a franchisee shall be subject to penalties, forfeitures and any other remedies or sanctions available under federal, state or local law, including without limitation this chapter and a franchisee's franchise with the city, if it fails to comply with the standards herein. 
(4)  A franchisee shall not be subject to penalties or liquidated damages as a result of any violations of these customer service standards that are due to force majeure as characterized in its franchise agreement. 
(l)  Anticompetitive acts prohibited. 
(1)  No franchisee or OVS operator shall demand the exclusive right to provide cable service to a person or location as a condition of extending cable service or a cable system. This provision is not intended and shall not be interpreted a) to prohibit voluntary exclusive agreements to provide cable service; b) to create any private cause of action for any person; or c) to prohibit exclusive agreements permitted by federal law. 
(2)  No franchisee or OVS operator shall engage in unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or practices, the purpose or effect of which is to hinder significantly or to prevent any multichannel video programming distributor, as defined in federal law, from providing cable service or services similar to cable service in the city. This provision does not apply to methods, acts or practices allowed by federal or state law. Any allegation that a franchisee has engaged in methods, acts or practices that would be prohibited by this paragraph will be considered by the city only after exhaustion of federal remedies. This paragraph is not intended to create a private cause of action. 
(Ord. No. 1309, 3-22-99)  
Sec. 5-10. - Rate regulation. 
(a)  General authority. The city reserves the right to regulate all rates and charges except to the extent it is prohibited from doing so by law. 
(b)  Nondiscrimination. 
(1)  Nondiscriminatory rates. Subject to applicable law, a franchisee shall establish rates that are nondiscriminatory within the same general class of subscribers and which must be applied fairly and uniformly to all subscribers in the franchise area for all services. Nothing contained herein shall prohibit a franchisee from offering, by way of illustration and not limitation, (i) discounts to senior citizens or economically disadvantaged groups; (ii) discounts to commercial and multiple family dwelling subscribers billed on a bulk basis; (iii) promotional discounts; or (iv) reduced installation rates for subscribers who have multiple services. 
(2)  Applicability. The provisions of this subsection 5-10(b) shall apply to all rates, whether or not they are otherwise subject to rate regulation, except to the extent specifically prohibited by law. 
(Ord. No. 1309, 3-22-99)  
Sec. 5-11. - Franchise fee. 
(a)  Finding. The city finds that public rights-of-way of the city to be used by a franchisee for the operation of a cable system are valuable public property acquired and maintained by the city. The city further finds that the grant of a franchise to use public rights-of-way is a valuable property right without which a franchisee would be required to invest substantial capital. 
(b)  Payment of franchise fee. Each franchisee shall pay a franchise fee of five (5) per cent of gross revenues. 
(c)  Method of payment. The franchisee shall file with the city, within thirty (30) days after the expiration of each of the franchisee's fiscal quarters, a financial statement clearly showing the gross revenues received by the franchisee during the preceding quarter. The quarterly portion of the franchise fee shall be payable to the city at the time such statement is filed. 
(d)  Not a tax or in lieu of any other tax or fee. 
(1)  Payment of the franchise fee shall not be considered in the nature of a tax or in lieu of other taxes or fees of general applicability imposed by the city. 
(2)  The franchise fee is in addition to all other taxes and payments that a franchisee may be required to pay under its franchise agreement or any federal, state, or local law, and to any other tax, fee, or assessment imposed by utilities and cable operators for use of their services, facilities, or equipment, including any applicable amusement taxes, except to the extent that such fees, taxes, or assessments must be treated as a franchise fee under Section 642 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 522. 
(3)  No franchisee may designate the franchise fee as a tax in any communication to a subscriber. 
(e)  Late payments. In the event any franchise fee payment or recomputation amount is not made on or before the required date, the franchisee shall pay additional compensation and interest charges computed from such due date, at an annual rate equal to the commercial prime interest rate of the city's primary depository bank during the period such unpaid amount is owed, in addition to any applicable penalties or liquidated damages. 
(f)  Audit. 
(1)  The city shall have the right to inspect records, to require a franchisee to provide copies of records at the franchisee's expense, and to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be payable, whether the records are held by the franchisee, an affiliate, or any other entity that collects or receives funds related to the franchisee's operation in the city, including, by way of illustration and not limitation, any entity that sells advertising on the franchisee's behalf, for a period of five (5) years from the date a payment was made or, if no payment was made, from the date the city believes payment was owed, after which time all payments are final. 
(2)  A franchisee shall be responsible for providing to the city all records necessary to confirm the accurate payment of franchise fees, without regard to by whom they are held. Such records shall be made available pursuant to the requirements of this chapter. The franchisee shall maintain such records for the term of its franchise agreement, and any renewals or extensions thereof. 
(3)  The city's audit expenses shall be borne by the city unless the audit discloses an underpayment of five (5) per cent or more of the amount due, in which case the costs of the audit shall be borne by the franchisee as a cost incidental to the enforcement of the franchise. Any additional amounts due to the city as a result of the audit shall be paid within thirty (30) days following written notice to the franchisee by the city of the underpayment, which notice shall include a copy of the audit report. If recomputation results in additional revenue to be paid to the city, such amount shall be subject to a ten (10) per cent interest charge. 
(g)  No accord or satisfaction. No acceptance of any payment by the city shall be construed as a release or an accord and satisfaction of any claim the city may have for further or additional sums due or for the performance of any other obligation of a franchisee, or as an acknowledgment that the amount paid is the correct amount due. 
(Ord. No. 1309, 3-22-99)  
Sec. 5-12. - Reports and records. 
(a)  Open books and records. 
(1)  The city shall have the right to inspect records and to require a franchisee to provide copies of records at the franchisee's expense at any time during normal business hours at the city cable system office for all books, receipts, maps, plans, contracts, service complaint logs, performance test results, records of requests for service, computer records, disks or other storage media and other like material which the city deems appropriate in order to monitor compliance with the terms of this chapter, its franchise agreement, or applicable law. This includes not only the books and records of a franchisee, but any books and records the city reasonably deems relevant held by an affiliate, a cable operator of the cable system, or any contractor, subcontractor or any person holding any form of management contract for the cable system. A franchisee is responsible for collecting the information and producing it at the location specified above, and by accepting its franchise it affirms that it can and will do so. A franchisee will be given reasonable advance written notice of any inspection request, which shall serve as notice that any or all of the above materials may be inspected. 
(2)  A franchisee shall maintain financial records that allow analysis and review of its operations in each individual franchise area. 
(3)  Access to a franchisee's records shall not be denied by such franchisee on the basis that said records contain "proprietary" information. Refusal to provide information required herein to the city shall be grounds for revocation. All confidential information received by the city shall remain confidential insofar as permitted by law. 
(4)  A franchisee shall maintain a file of records open to public inspection in accordance with applicable FCC rules and regulations. 
(5)  Each report filed by a franchisee pursuant to this chapter shall be certified by a corporate officer as accurate or complete. 
(b)  Communication with regulatory agencies. 
(1)  If and to the extent requested by the city, a franchisee shall file with the city in a form acceptable to the city all reports and materials submitted to the FCC, the Security and Exchange Commission, or any other federal or state regulatory commission or agency, including, but not limited to, any proof of performance tests and results, Equal Employment Opportunity reports, and all petitions, applications, and communications of all types regarding the cable system, or a group of cable systems of which the franchisee's cable system is a part, submitted by the franchisee, an affiliate, or any other person on the behalf of the franchisee. 
(2)  Materials filed with the city pursuant to section 5-12(b)(1) shall be filed as follows: Materials submitted by the franchisee, an affiliate, or any other person on the behalf of a franchisee shall be filed with the city at the time they are submitted to the receiving agency. 
(c)  Annual report. Unless this requirement is waived in whole or in part by the city, by April 1 of each year for the previous calendar year, a franchisee shall submit a written report to the city, in a form directed by the city, which shall include: 
(1)  A summary of the previous year's activities in development of the cable system, including but not limited to descriptions of services begun or dropped, the number of subscribers gained or lost for each category of service, the number of pay units sold, the amount collected annually from users of the system and the character and extent of the services rendered to such users, including leased access channel users; 
(2)  A summary of complaints, identifying both the number and nature of the complaints received and an explanation of their dispositions, to the extent such records are kept by the franchisee. Where complaints involve recurrent system problems, the nature of each problem and the corrective measures taken shall be identified; 
(3)  A report showing the number of service calls received by type during the prior quarter, and the percentage of service calls compared to the subscriber base by type of complaint; 
(4)  A certification of compliance with applicable customer service standards. If a franchisee is in non-compliance with any standard during any calendar quarter, it shall include in its annual filing a statement specifying areas of non-compliance, the reason for the non-compliance and a remedial plan; 
(5)  A copy of the franchisee's rules and regulations applicable to subscribers of the cable system; 
(6)  An annual statement showing the yearly gross revenues, prepared and audited by a certified public accountant acceptable to the city;

a.  Such assignment, receivership or trusteeship has been vacated; or 
b.  Such assignee, receiver, or trustee has fully complied with the terms and conditions of this chapter and the applicable franchise agreement and has executed an agreement, approved by a court of competent jurisdiction, under which it assumes and agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this chapter and the applicable franchise agreement, and such other conditions as may be established or as are required by applicable law. 
(2)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of any of the facilities, equipment, or property of a franchisee, the city may revoke the franchise, following a public hearing, by serving notice on the franchisee and the successful bidder, in which event the franchise and all rights and privileges of the franchise will be revoked and will terminate thirty (30) calendar days after serving such notice, unless:

(d)  Relation to insurance and indemnity requirements. Recovery by the city of any amounts under insurance, the security fund, the performance bond, or letter of credit, or otherwise does not limit a franchisee's duty to indemnify the city in any way; nor shall such recovery relieve a franchisee of its obligations under a franchise, limit the amounts owed to the city, or in any respect prevent the city from exercising any other right or remedy it may have. 
(Ord. No. 1309, 3-22-99)

Any such transfer without the prior written consent of the city shall be considered to impair the city's assurance of due performance. The granting of approval for a transfer in one instance shall not render unnecessary approval of any subsequent transfer. 
(b)  Approval does not constitute waiver. Approval by the city of a transfer does not constitute a waiver or release of any of the rights of the city under this chapter or a franchise agreement, whether arising before or after the date of the transfer.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 
 
Sec. 7-1. - Findings. 
(a)  The city council finds and determines that the continuous growth and development of the city requires the reasonable and effective control and regulation of the excessive accumulation of litter as herein defined. Further, such accumulation on improved and unimproved property readily threatens or endangers the public health, safety or welfare by reason of the fact that such property is or may reasonably become infested or inhabited by rodents, vermin, mosquitoes or wild animals; or may reasonably cause disease; or may reasonably constitute a present or potential fire hazard; and singly, or in any combination thereof, is hereby prohibited, and declared to be a public nuisance subject to the penalties and procedures hereinafter prescribed. 
(b)  The city council further finds and determines, as a matter of common knowledge, that high growth of weeds in the populous areas has a strong tendency to produce sickness and to impair the health of the inhabitants and may readily be a public nuisance. Further, the city council recognizes that weeds, as such, when matured so as to bear wingy or downy seeds may readily become a fire menace when dry; and that they may furnish a breeding place for mosquitoes; and are hereby declared to be a public nuisance subject to the penalties and procedures hereinafter prescribed.

c.  The information in the application shall be maintained current at all times. Failure to do so shall be grounds for suspension of the permit. Changes shall be forwarded to the police department. 
d.  The alarm user shall make provision for silencing the local audible alarm within one (1) hour from the time the signal is received by the police department, either automatically or by one (1) of the authorized persons.

If any employee of the city is found to have knowingly or willfully revealed the information contained in an alarm user permit application or in correspondence or communications with an alarm user to any other person for any purpose not related to this section or official law enforcement matters, and without the express written consent of the alarm user supplying such information, the city employee shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. 
(6)  Registration sticker. Upon the issuance of a permit, and when a permit is renewed, the permittee shall be given a registration sticker with a registration number which shall be posted at the main entrance of the building in such a manner as to be readily seen by police without entry. 
(7)  Unauthorized use of alarm system. Any alarm system user who operates an alarm system without first obtaining a permit as required by this section, or who, after having a permit revoked or suspended, and after exhausting his rights to hearing and appeal, fails to disconnect his alarm system, shall be in violation of this section and shall be guilty of a municipal infraction. 
(d)  False alarms. 
(1)  More than six (6) false alarms in any one (1) calendar year from any alarm system for which an alarm user permit has been obtained may constitute grounds for suspension or revocation of such permit, subject to the provisions of this section. 
(2)  An alarm user shall reimburse the city the cost of responding to each false alarm over six (6), in any one (1) calendar year. Failure to make such reimbursement as provided herein shall be grounds for revocation of such permit. The rate of reimbursement shall be fifty dollars ($50.00) per alarm and shall be paid within thirty (30) days of receipt of the bill from the city. 
(3)  After the police department has responded to six (6) "false alarms" within a calendar year from any alarm user permit holder, or has failed to receive the reimbursement for costs of false alarms as provided herein, it shall notify the permit holder in writing of such fact, setting forth the dates of each reported false alarm and shall require that the permit holder submit a report to the police department within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice, describing efforts to discover and eliminate the cause or causes of the false alarms or the reason for failure to reimburse. If, however, the alarm user, by reason of absence from the city or on any other reasonable basis requests an extension of time to file the report, the chief may, for good cause, extend the fifteen-day period for a reasonable period. If the permit holder fails to submit such a report within fifteen (15) days or within any such extended period, the chief may revoke the user's permit and under such circumstances the user shall not be entitled to a hearing or appeal under this section. 
(4)  If the alarm user submits a report as required by subsection (3) of this section, but the director of the department of community planning and business services determines that the reimbursement costs have not been paid, that the report is unsatisfactory, or that the alarm user has failed to show by the report that he has taken or will take reasonable steps to eliminate or reduce false alarms, then the director may issue written notice of his/her intent to revoke or suspend the alarm user's permit. 
(5)  If, after submission of a report required by subsection (d)(3) of this section which is satisfactory to the director, the alarm system of the permit holder incurs one (1) or more false alarms during the same calendar year, the director may issue written notice of his or her intention to revoke or suspend the alarm user's permit. 
(6)  Upon receipt of a notice of intent to revoke or suspend an alarm user's permit pursuant to subsection (d)(4) or (5) of this section, the alarm permit holder may, within fifteen (15) days of such receipt, submit a written request for a hearing before the director setting forth the reasons that his or her permit should not be revoked or suspended. 
(7)  Written notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be served on the holder of the permit by the director by certified mail at least ten (10) days prior to the date set for the hearing. 
(8)  At the hearing before the director or their designee, the holder of the permit, or his or her authorized representative, shall have the right to confront and examine witnesses, and to present evidence on his or her own behalf. The introduction into evidence of a police report indicating a false alarm did occur shall be prima facie evidence of a false alarm unless the holder of the permit or his or her agent has submitted in writing, under oath, a denial of such fact. The burden of proving the reason for an alarm shall be on the holder of the permit. After the hearing, the director may issue an order of revocation, withdraw the notice of revocation, or suspend the permit until reimbursement or until such time that the director is satisfied that the cause or causes of the false alarms have been eliminated. 
(9)  Any person whose permit has been revoked or suspended pursuant to this section shall have the right, within fifteen (15) days after receiving notice of such action from the director to file a written appeal to the board of appeals; and no alarm user shall be required to discontinue use of his alarm system prior to the expiration of such fifteen-day period. Such appeal shall set forth the specific ground or grounds on which it is based. The board of appeals shall hold a hearing on the appeal within thirty (30) days after its receipt of the written appeal, and shall cause the appellant to be given at least fifteen (15) days' written notice of such hearing. The hearing shall be de novo, and the appellant or his or her designated representative shall have the right to present evidence, to confront and examine witnesses, and present written and/or oral argument, in support of the appeal. The board of appeals shall issue its decision in writing within fifteen (15) days after the hearing. Its decision shall include its findings of facts, and its decision in which it may affirm, reverse, or modify the order of the director from which the appeal is taken. 
(10)  If a permit holder files an appeal pursuant to subsection (d)(9) of this section, he or she shall not be required to discontinue the alarm system until a final decision is made on his appeal. 
(11)  A person aggrieved by the final decision of the board of appeals shall have a right to appeal from that decision to the circuit court for Prince George's pursuant to the Maryland Rules relating to administrative appeals. 
(12)  An alarm user whose permit has been revoked is not precluded under this section from applying for a new permit. The director, however, is not required to issue a new permit unless the director is satisfied that the alarm user's system has been properly serviced, that its deficiencies corrected, and that the city has been reimbursed for false alarms. The director may impose reasonable restrictions and conditions upon issuing a new permit to an alarm user with respect to the particular system for which the permit was revoked. 
(e)  Notices. Any notices required to be given to an alarm user pursuant to this section shall be made, unless otherwise required herein, by first class mail, postage prepaid, at the address of the alarm user or his or her permit application; such notice may be hand-delivered to the alarm user in lieu of mailing. 
(f)  Penalties for violation. 
(1)  The failure of any person to either obtain an alarm user permit as required in this section, or obey any order of the director for suspension or revocation of an alarm user permit after such person has exhausted his rights to hearings or appeals constitutes a municipal infraction and not a misdemeanor. The penalty for such municipal infraction shall be a fine of two hundred dollars ($200.00). Each day that any such violation continues after the expiration of the period allowed for compliance under the provisions of this section shall constitute a separate offense. The director or his or her designee is authorized to issue citations for such infractions. 
(2)  Any city employee who shall violate the provision of subsection (c)(5) of this section relating to the unauthorized release of information shall be subject to a fine of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), or by imprisonment for a term not to exceed six (6) months, or both.

ARTICLE III. - AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAM[3] 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 1830 , adopted Feb. 23, 2015, repealed Art. III and enacted a new article as set out herein. The former Art. III, §§ 11-34—11-51, pertained to moderately priced dwelling units and derived from Ord. No. 1584, §§ 3.1—3-13, adopted March 10, 2008. 
 
Sec. 11-39. - Legislative findings. 
The mayor and city council of Laurel hereby finds that a severe housing problem exists within the city with respect to the supply of housing relative to the need for housing for residents with low and moderate incomes. Specifically, the mayor and city council finds: 
(1)  The city is experiencing an increase in residents of or approaching retirement age, with consequent fixed or reduced incomes; young adults of modest means forming new households; government employees in moderate income ranges; and mercantile and service personnel needed to serve the expanding industrial and commercial base and population growth of the city; 
(2)  The inadequate supply of housing in the city for persons of low and moderate income results in large scale commuting from outside the city to places of employment within the city thereby overtaxing existing roads and transportation facilities and significantly contributing to air and noise pollution, which adversely affect the health, safety and welfare of, and result in an added financial burden on, the citizens of the city; 
(3)  That the cost of housing has been inflated because of state and county exactions and fees; 
(4)  Experience indicates that the continuing high level of demand for more luxurious housing, with a higher profit potential; discourages developers from offering a more diversified range of housing, and the production of workforce and moderately priced housing is further deterred by the high cost of land, materials and labor; 
(5)  Actual production experience in the city indicates that if land costs can be reduced, housing of a more modest size with fewer amenities can be built to be rented at a profit in view of the existing ready market for such housing; 
(6)  Given the proper incentive, the private sector is equipped and possesses the necessary resources and expertise required to provide the type of workforce and moderately priced housing needed in the city. 
(Ord. No. 1830 , 2-23-15)  
Sec. 11-40. - Declaration of public policy. 
The mayor and city council hereby declares it to be the public policy of the city to: 
(1)  Implement the housing goals and objectives as outlined in the City Master Plan by providing for a full range of housing choices, conveniently located in a suitable living environment, for all incomes, ages and family sizes; 
(2)  Provide for affordable housing to meet existing and anticipated future employment needs in the city; 
(3)  Assure that affordable housing is dispersed throughout the city; 
(4)  Encourage the construction of affordable housing by allowing optional increases in density in order to reduce land costs and costs of optional features that may be built into such affordable housing; 
(5)  Require that any multifamily development of fifty (50) or more dwelling units include a minimum of three (3) per cent of the total number of apartments as work force housing units and a minimum of three (3) per cent of the total number of apartments as moderately priced housing units. Work force housing units and moderately priced housing units shall be of varying sizes with regard to family needs; 
(6)  That private developers constructing work force and moderately priced housing units under this article incur no loss or penalty as a result thereof, and have reasonable prospects of realizing a profit on such units by virtue of the affordable housing density bonus provision. The burden is on the developer to take advantage of these provisions; 
(7)  The provision for density bonus shall not apply in city revitalization overlay areas.

(a)  Development procedures. 
(1)  When a development is subject to this article, the developer shall submit to the department of community planning and business services, concurrent with the submission of the final site plan for approval; as applicable:

Sec. 11-43. - Requirement; density bonus. 
(a)  Except as provided herein, the number of work force dwelling units and moderately priced dwelling units for any development to which this Article applies shall equal three (3) per cent work force and three (3) per cent moderately priced units or six (6) per cent of the total units in the development. 
(b)  When the development at one (1) location is in any zone that provides for an affordable housing program density bonus, or is covered by a special development procedure such as the city revitalization overlay process, or requires a building permit to be issued for construction, the required number of work force dwelling units/moderately priced dwelling units is a variable percentage that is not less than three (3) per cent each of the total number of dwelling units at that location. Except as specified in this subsection the required number of affordable housing units shall vary according to the amount by which the approved development exceeds the normal or standard density for the zone in which it is located. Bonus densities shall be granted in certain zones over the presumed base density where affordable housing units are provided. If the use of the optional affordable housing development standards does not result in an increase over the base density, the Director or their designee shall conclude that the base density could not be achieved under conventional development standards, in which case the required number of affordable housing units shall not be less than three (3) per cent work force dwelling units and three (3) per cent moderately price dwelling units a total of six (6) per cent of the total number of units in the development. The amount of density bonus achieved in the approved development determines the percentage of total unit that must be affordable housing units as follows: 
(1)  Up to three (3) per cent density bonus per housing type shall be allowed for the three (3) per cent requirement for work force dwelling units and moderately price dwelling units. 
(2)  In revitalization overlay area developments, the number of work force dwelling units and moderately price dwelling units shall not be less than either the number of density bonus units or three (3) per cent each of the total number of units, whichever is greater. 
(c)  If an applicant does not build the affordable housing units contained in the staging plan with or before other dwelling units, the city may withhold any subsequent building permit to the applicant until the affordable housing units contained in the staging plan are built. 
(d)  Later deeds. The grantor must state, in any deed or instrument conveying title to a development, that the conveyed property contains affordable housing units and is subject to the restrictions contained in the covenants required under this section during the control period until the restrictions are released. 
(Ord. No. 1830 , 2-23-15)  
Sec. 11-44. - Zoning provisions; waiver of requirements. 
(a)  Zoning provisions. If the applicant elects the optional density provisions, permitting the construction of an increased number of dwelling units up to three (3) per cent work force dwelling units and up to three (3) per cent affordable priced dwelling units, the requisite percentage and number of affordable housing units shall apply to the total number of dwelling units as increased by application of the optional density provisions that increases the density above the otherwise permitted density of the zoning classification in which the property is situated. 
(b)  Waiver of requirements. Any applicant, who presents sufficient evidence to the director in applying for a use permit or development, may be granted a waiver from part of all of this section. The waiver must be related only to the number of affordable housing units to be built and may be granted only if the mayor and city council, after recommendation by the director of community planning and business services, finds that the applicant cannot attain the full density of the zone, because of any requirements of the unified land development code (ULDC) or the administration of other laws or regulations. When any part of the land that dwelling units cannot be built on for physical reasons is used to compute permitted density, the applicant's inability to use the optional density bonus provisions is not in itself grounds for waiving the affordable housing unit requirements. Any waiver must be strictly construed and limited. 
(Ord. No. 1830 , 2-23-15)

(d)  A request from any person to temporarily close any road or any part thereof must be submitted in writing to the department not less than ten (10) working days in advance of the date of the proposed closing. The director may waive the ten-day notice requirement in cases of emergency beyond the control of the requester. The request shall include not less than the following information:

(g)  The permittee shall post signs in the area of the proposed road-closing at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to the closure, such signs to advise the public of the time and anticipated duration of the closing. In the event that the road closure is for emergency repairs, such signs shall be posted as soon as practicable before the road closure. Such signs shall be of such size, and shall be placed in such areas, as the director, or his or her designee, in his or her discretion, deem adequate for notice to the public. The director, or his or her designee, may also require the permittee to tow vehicles in the vicinity of the proposed closure to such location(s) as the director, or his or her designee, deem adequate for the safety of persons and property.

A permittee shall incur no liability hereunder for the towing, or failure to tow, any vehicle, or for the posting, or failure to post, any signage, provided that such permittee complies with the provisions of this subsection, the provisions of the permittee's permit, and other applicable law. 
(h)  Failure of the requester to comply with any condition of the written permission for temporary closing shall result in immediate revocation of the permission, and the director may require the roadway to be restored to a safe condition and to be reopened to public use immediately. 
(i)  Prior to expiration of the time stated in the written permission for the temporary closing, the requester shall be required to restore the road to a safe condition and shall reopen the road to public use at the end of the time stated. However, the director may, at his/her sole discretion, grant an extension of the time for reopening, upon his/her determination that such extension is necessary for public safety or convenience or is necessitated by reasons beyond the control of the requester.

Sec. 16-2. - Property tax credit for restoration and preservation of certain historically valuable, architecturally valuable, or architecturally compatible structures. 
(a)  Subject to the provisions of this section, there shall be allowed a tax credit on city real property taxes based upon the amount expended by a private owner taxpayer for restoration and preservation of any historically valuable, architecturally valuable, or architecturally compatible structure in the city. Pursuant to Ann. Code of Md. Tax-Property article, § 9-204 (1994 Replacement Volume), as amended, to qualify for a property tax credit under this section, a structure shall: 
(1)  Have historic value; 
(2)  Have architectural value; or 
(3)  Be designated under Article 66B, §§ 8.01 through 8.17, as an architecturally compatible new structure that is located in an historic district. 
(b)  (1)  The tax credit shall be in an amount equal to ten (10) percent of the properly documented expenses of a private owner taxpayer for the restoration and preservation of a structure that qualifies under subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) hereof. 
(2)  The tax credit shall be in an amount equal to five (5) percent of the properly documented expenses of a private owner taxpayer for the restoration and preservation of a structure that qualifies under subsection (a)(3) hereof. 
(3)  Any such tax credit shall be limited to those expenses directly related to the restoration and preservation of exterior features of a qualified structure. No expenses relating to work performed in the interior of a structure may serve as a basis for a tax credit pursuant to this section. 
(4)  In the event that the subject work was commenced prior to the filing of an application to receive a tax credit pursuant to this section, the maximum tax credit available to the applicant, for the subject work, shall be one-half (½) of the tax credit otherwise available pursuant to this subsection (b), unless the commission finds that such work was commenced prior to the filing of the application due to an emergency situation existing on the premises. 
(c)  The tax credit referred to in this section shall be allowed for the city tax year immediately subsequent to the year in which the restoration or preservation work is completed, and any unused portion of this tax credit may be carried forward to subsequent tax years, not to exceed five (5) subsequent tax years. 
(d)  Application for the tax credit referred to in this section shall be included as part of the building permit application and shall be made at the time that the application is made for the permit for the restoration or preservation of such structure; provided however that such application may be made during the time in which the building permit application is pending. After the final inspection and approval of the work, the tax credit application may be filed only for good cause shown, as determined by the historic district commission (hereinafter "the commission). The commission shall review the application for tax credit, and such supplementary materials as may be presented by the applicant, the commission's chief executive officer (hereinafter "the executive officer"), and city staff, any other interested person, and any agent of any of the foregoing persons, and shall, based thereon, determine whether the subject structure is a qualified structure hereunder. Such determination shall be made at a regular or special public meeting of such body. 
(1)  In making such determination, the commission may rely on the expertise and knowledge of its membership, and may seek information from such sources as it deems advisable, provided the applicant and all interested persons are given an opportunity to examine and comment on such sources. 
(2)  The commission shall make the aforesaid determination at the time it takes action on the application for certificate of approval for the subject work, or, in the event that the subject structure is not within a designated city historic district, within ninety (90) days of the filing of the application for tax credit with the commission. It is the intent of the mayor and city council of Laurel that the provisions of this section be liberally construed to permit property tax credits in accordance herewith, to thereby encourage the maintenance of, and repair to, historically valuable structures within the city. 
(3)  A report and recommendation as to the amount of the allowed expenses hereunder, and the corresponding property tax credit, shall be made by the executive officer, or his or her designee, to the commission. Such report and recommendation shall be made within thirty (30) days of submission of all required documentation and information, by the applicant, to the commission, or, within thirty (30) days after the one year anniversary of the filing of the tax credit application, whichever occurs first. The amount of any such tax credit, as recommended by the executive officer, shall only be based on those allowed expenses incurred and properly documented by the applicant prior to the date of such determination. 
(e)  The commission shall determine the availability of a tax credit hereunder, and the amount of the tax credit, after consideration of the executive officer's report and recommendation, and the other testimony and materials submitted to the commission. The tax credit application shall not be finally approved by the commission until final inspection and approval of the subject work by the department of economic and community development and until the copies of paid receipts required by his section have been filed with the commission, accompanied by the oath or affirmation of the private owner taxpayer, on such forms as may be prescribed by the commission from time to time, that the copies of the paid receipts submitted are those for the actual expenditures in connection with the restoration and preservation of the structure. 
(f)  To properly document expenses as required by subsection (b) hereof, a private owner taxpayer shall submit to the commission the following items: 
(1)  Prior to commencement of the work; a statement signed and dated by the private owner taxpayer providing the address of the property for which the tax credit is requested, a description of the work which is to be commenced for which the tax credit is requested, an estimate of the time required to complete such work, and an estimate of the total cost to complete such work; 
(2)  During or after completion of the work; copies of paid receipts for each item for which a tax credit is claimed; each such receipt shall indicate the date, and from whom, that the subject goods or services were purchased. 
(g)  Commission members, the executive officer, and such persons and/or professionals as may be designated by them, shall be permitted access to the subject structure, at such reasonable times as they may request, and upon reasonable notice to the private owner taxpayer, to inspect such structure, the work being performed, and the progress of such work; failure to provide such persons reasonable access to the structure for these purposes shall serve as an adequate basis for the denial of the tax credit application. 
(h)  No tax credit shall be granted under this section for any expense: 
(1)  For which a copy of a paid receipt cannot be produced; 
(2)  Which was incurred prior to the filing of an application for a tax credit with the commission, unless the commission finds that such work was commenced prior to the filing of the application due to an emergency situation existing on the premises; 
(3)  Which was incurred more than twelve (12) months prior to the time that a copy of the paid receipt for such expense is submitted to the commission; 
(4)  Which has not, in fact, already been incurred by the applicant related to the restoration and preservation of a qualified structure hereunder; 
(5)  Related to any work at the subject structure where the total cost of all work for which a tax credit is sought is less that one hundred dollars ($100.00); 
(6)  For labor performed by the applying private owner taxpayer; or 
(7)  If copies of canceled checks, or copies of credit card receipts, evidencing when payments were made, and to whom, for work performed on the subject property, are not submitted to the commission or staff within thirty (30) days, or such reasonable period as may be permitted by the commission, after a request that the private owner taxpayer supply same. 
(i)  In the event that the commission is unable to discern the amount of the expenses related to the subject work after review of the documentation submitted by the applying private owner taxpayer as required above, the commission may request such applicant to provide signed and dated affidavits from the relevant suppliers, vendors, contractors, subcontractors, and other providers of goods and services related to the subject work, evidencing when the work was done, what work was done, and the costs related thereto. 
(j)  This section shall be applicable to restoration and preservation work for which application is made on or after September 1, 1998. 
(k)  Notwithstanding any provision in this section to the contrary, no tax credit shall be allowed for any restoration or preservation work which has not been reviewed and approved in advance by the commission, except for good cause shown. 
(l)  This commission shall deny the tax credit in regard to any aspects of the restoration and preservation work not done in a workmanlike manner or which has a material negative effect on the architectural quality of the structure. 
(m)  The mayor and city council may require the owner of a structure granted a tax credit under this section to periodically exhibit the structure for public education. 
(n)  (1)  The aggregate of all tax credits granted by the commission, in any city fiscal year, pursuant to this section, shall not exceed thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00), or such amount as may be established by resolution of the mayor and city council from time to time. Tax credits granted pursuant to this section shall be granted in the order that applications are received for such credits, provided that all documentation and information required hereunder has been submitted to the commission by the applicant. 
(2)  Any person or persons for whom a tax credit would have been available under this section, but for whom such tax credit cannot be granted due to the cap provided by subsection (n)(1) hereof, shall be the first person or persons for whom a tax credit is considered in the following fiscal year, in the order that their original applications were submitted. The period of time available to such persons hereunder, over which their tax credit may be spread, shall not commence until the first city tax year that a tax credit hereunder becomes available to them.

The information contained in an alarm user permit application required by this section and other information received by the department of community planning and business services through correspondence or communications with an alarm user shall be securely maintained and restricted to inspection only by police officers or city employees specifically assigned the responsibility for handling and processing alarm user permits in the course of official duties. If any employee of the city is found to have knowingly or willfully revealed the information contained in an alarm user permit application or in correspondence or communications with an alarm user to any other person for any purpose not related to this section, and without the express written consent of the alarm user supplying such information, the city employee shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. 
(6)  Registration sticker. Upon the issuance of a permit, and when a permit is renewed, the permittee shall be given a registration sticker with a registration number, which shall be posted at the main entrance of the building in such a manner as to be readily seen by the fire marshal without entry. 
(7)  Unauthorized use of alarm system. Any alarm system user who operates an alarm system without first obtaining a permit as required by this section, or who, after having a permit revoked or suspended, and after exhausting his rights to hearing and appeal, fails to disconnect his alarm system, shall be in violation of this section and shall be guilty of a municipal infraction. 
(d)  False alarms. 
(1)  More than four (4) false alarms in any one (1) calendar year from any alarm system for which an alarm user permit has been obtained may constitute grounds for suspension or revocation of such permit, subject to the provisions of this section. 
(2)  An alarm user shall reimburse the city the cost of responding to each false alarm over four (4), in any one (1) calendar year. Failure to make such reimbursement as provided herein shall be grounds for revocation of such permit. The rate of reimbursement shall be seventy-five dollars ($75.00) per alarm and shall be paid within thirty (30) days of receipt of the bill from the city. 
(3)  After the fire department has responded to four (4) "false alarms" within a calendar year from any alarm user permit holder, or has failed to receive the reimbursement for costs of false alarms as provided herein, it shall notify the permit holder in writing of such fact, setting forth the dates of each reported false alarm and shall require that the permit holder submit a report to the department of community planning and business services within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such notice, describing efforts to discover and eliminate the cause or causes of the false alarms or the reason for failure to reimburse. If, however, the alarm user, by reason of absence from the city or on any other reasonable basis requests an extension of time to file the report, the fire marshal may, for good cause, extend the fifteen-day period for a reasonable period. If the permit holder fails to submit such a report within fifteen (15) days or within any such extended period, the fire marshal may revoke the user's permit and under such circumstances the user shall not be entitled to a hearing or appeal under this section. 
(4)  If the alarm user submits a report as required by subsection (3) of this section, but the fire marshal determines that the reimbursement costs have not been paid, that the report is unsatisfactory, or that the alarm user has failed to show by the report that he has taken or will take reasonable steps to eliminate or reduce false alarms, then the fire marshal may issue written notice of his or her intent to revoke or suspend the alarm user's permit. 
(5)  If, after submission of a report required by subsection (d)(3) of this section which is satisfactory to the fire marshal, the alarm system of the permit holder incurs one (1) or more false alarms during the same calendar year, the fire marshal may issue written notice of his or her intention to revoke or suspend the alarm user's permit. 
(6)  Upon receipt of a notice of intent to revoke or suspend an alarm user's permit pursuant to subsection (d)(4) or (5) of this section, the alarm permit holder may, within fifteen (15) days of such receipt, submit a written request for a hearing before the fire marshal setting forth the reasons that his or her permit should not be revoked or suspended. 
(7)  Written notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be served on the holder of the permit by the fire marshal by certified mail at least ten (10) days prior to the date set for the hearing. 
(8)  At the hearing before the fire marshal or his designee, the holder of the permit, or his or her authorized representative, shall have the right to confront and examine witnesses, and to present evidence on his or her own behalf. The introduction into evidence of a fire department report indicating a false alarm did occur shall be prima facie evidence of a false alarm unless the holder of the permit or his or her agent has submitted in writing, under oath, a denial of such fact. The burden of proving the reason for an alarm shall be on the holder of the permit. After the hearing, the fire marshal may issue an order of revocation, withdraw the notice of revocation, or suspend the permit until reimbursement or until such time that the fire marshal is satisfied that the cause or causes of the false alarms have been eliminated. 
(9)  Any person whose permit has been revoked or suspended pursuant to this section shall have the right, within fifteen (15) days after receiving notice of such action from the fire marshal to file a written appeal to the board of construction appeals; and no alarm user shall be required to discontinue use of his alarm system prior to the expiration of such fifteen-day period. Such appeal shall set forth the specific ground or grounds on which it is based. The board of construction appeals shall hold a hearing on the appeal within thirty (30) days after its receipt of the written appeal, and shall cause the appellant to be given at least fifteen (15) days' written notice of such hearing. The hearing shall be de novo, and the appellant or his or her designated representative shall have the right to present evidence, to confront and examine witnesses, and present written and/or oral argument, in support of the appeal. The board of construction appeals shall issue its decision in writing within fifteen (15) days after the hearing. Its decision shall include its findings of facts, and its decision in which it may affirm, reverse, or modify the order of the fire marshal from which the appeal is taken. 
(10)  If a permit holder files an appeal pursuant to subsection (d)(9) of this section, he or she shall not be required to discontinue the alarm system until a final decision is made on his appeal. 
(11)  A person aggrieved by the final decision of the board of construction appeals shall have a right to appeal from that decision to the Circuit Court for Prince George's pursuant to the Maryland Rules relating to administrative appeals. 
(12)  An alarm user whose permit has been revoked is not precluded under this section from applying for a new permit. The fire marshal, however, is not required to issue a new permit unless the fire marshal is satisfied that the alarm user's system has been properly serviced, that its deficiencies corrected, and that the city has been reimbursed for false alarms. The fire marshal may impose reasonable restrictions and conditions upon issuing a new permit to an alarm user with respect to the particular system for which the permit was revoked. 
(e)  Notices. Any notices required to be given to an alarm user pursuant to this section shall be made, unless otherwise required herein, by first class mail, postage prepaid, at the address of the alarm user or his or her permit application; such notice may be hand-delivered to the alarm user in lieu of mailing. 
(f)  Penalties for violation. 
(1)  The failure of any person to either obtain an alarm user permit as required in this section, or obey any order of the fire marshal for suspension or revocation of an alarm user permit after such person has exhausted his rights to hearings or appeals constitutes a municipal infraction and not a misdemeanor. The penalty for such municipal infraction shall be a fine of two hundred dollars ($200.00). Each day that any such violation continues after the expiration of the period allowed for compliance under the provisions of this section shall constitute a separate offense. The fire marshal or their designee is authorized to issue citations for such infractions. 
(2)  Any city employee who shall violate the provision of subsection (c)(5) of this section relating to the unauthorized release of information shall be subject to a fine of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), or by imprisonment for a term not to exceed six (6) months, or both.

The city recognizes the importance of wireless telecommunications facilities to provide high-quality communications service to the residents and businesses within the city, and the city also recognizes its obligation to comply with applicable federal and state law regarding the placement of wireless telecommunications facilities in its rights-of-way, and this article shall be interpreted consistent with those provisions. 
( Ord. No. 1947, 10-28-19 )  
Sec. 20-28. - Scope. 
(a)  In general. Unless exempted, every person who desires to place a wireless telecommunications facility in the rights-of-way, or modify an existing wireless telecommunications facility must obtain a wireless placement permit authorizing the placement or modification. 
(b)  Exemptions. Except as to this section 20-27 and section 20-29, this article does not apply to: 
(1)  The placement or modification of wireless telecommunications facilities on supporting structures owned, or under the control of, the city, the use of which is subject to a contract for use of the facility between the city and the entity or entities that own or control the wireless telecommunications facility; and such conditions as the city may establish by negotiation or guidelines adopted by the city. 
(2)  The placement or modification of wireless facilities by the city or by any other agency of the state solely for public safety purposes. 
(3)  Modifications to an existing wireless telecommunications facility that makes no material change to the footprint of a facility or to the surface or subsurface of a public street if the activity does not disrupt or impede traffic in the traveled portion of a street, and if the work activity does not change the visual or audible characteristics of the wireless telecommunications facility. The city, by wireless regulation, may also exempt wireless telecommunications facilities that otherwise are subject to the provisions of this section from the obligation to obtain a permit to install or modify a wireless telecommunications facility where it is determined that because of the physical characteristics of the proposed facilities, and the work associated with them, such a permit is not required to protect the public health, welfare or safety, to maintain the character of a neighborhood or corridor, or to otherwise serve the purposes of this article. 
(4)  Installation of a "cell on wheels," "cell on truck" or a similar structure for a temporary period in connection with an emergency or event, but no longer than required for the emergency or event, provided that installation does not involve excavation, movement or removal of existing facilities. 
(5)  A micro wireless facility strung between two (2) utility poles as defined in section 20-28 and provided further that the installation does not require replacement of the strand, or excavation, modification or replacement of the utility poles. 
(c)  Other applicable requirements. In addition to the wireless telecommunications permit required herein, the placement of a wireless telecommunications facility in the public rights-of-way requires the persons who will own or control those facilities to obtain the franchises and permits required by applicable law, and to comply with applicable law, including, but not limited to, article VI of the land development code, and including, but not limited to, applicable law governing radio frequency (RF) emissions. 
(d)  Public use. Except as otherwise provided by Maryland law, any use of the right-of-way authorized pursuant to this article will be subordinate to the city's use and use by the public.

( Ord. No. 1947, 10-28-19 )  
Sec. 20-31. - General standards for wireless telecommunications facilities in the rights-of-way. 
(a)  Generally. Wireless telecommunications facilities shall meet the minimum requirements set forth in this article and the wireless regulations, in addition to the requirements of any other applicable law. 
(b)  Regulations. The wireless regulations and decisions on applications for placement of wireless telecommunications facilities in the rights-of-way shall, at a minimum, ensure that the requirements of this section are satisfied, unless it is determined that applicant has established that denial of an application would, within the meaning of federal law, prohibit or effectively prohibit the provision of personal wireless services, or otherwise violate applicable laws or regulations, under circumstances such that deployment of the facilities must be authorized. If that determination is made, the requirements of this ordinance [article], including any regulations and forms to implement this article may be waived, but only to the minimum extent required to avoid conflict with federal law. 
(c)  Standards. Wireless telecommunications facilities shall be installed and modified in a manner that minimizes risks to public safety, avoids placement of aboveground facilities in underground areas, avoids installation of new support structures or equipment cabinets in the public rights-of-way and otherwise maintains the integrity and character of the neighborhoods and corridors in which the facilities are located; ensures that installations are subject to periodic review to minimize the intrusion on the rights-of-way; and ensures that the city bears no risk or liability as a result of the installations, and that such use does not inconvenience the public, interfere with the primary uses of the public rights-of-way, or hinder the ability of the city or other government agencies to improve, modify, relocate, abandon or vacate the public rights-of-way or any portion thereof, or the ability of the city or other government agencies to cause the improvement, modification, relocation, vacation or abandonment of facilities in the rights-of-way. 
(d)  Concealment. Permits for wireless telecommunications facilities shall incorporate specific concealment elements to minimize visual impacts, and design requirements ensuring compliance with all standards for noise emissions. Unless it is determined that another design is less intrusive or placement is required under applicable law: 
(1)  Antennas located at the top of support structures shall be incorporated into the structure, or placed within shrouds of a size such that the antenna appears to be part of the support structure. 
(2)  Antennas placed elsewhere on a support structure shall be integrated into the structure, or be designed and placed to minimize visual impacts. 
(3)  Radio units or equipment cabinets holding radio units and mounted on a utility pole shall be placed as high as possible on a support structure, placed to avoid interfering or creating any hazard to any other use of the public rights-of-way, and located on one side of the utility pole. Unless the radio units or equipment cabinets can be concealed by appropriate traffic signage, radio units or equipment cabinets mounted below the communications space on utility poles shall be designed so that the largest dimension is vertical, and the width is such that the radio units or equipment cabinets are minimally visible from the opposite side of the support structure on which they are placed. 
(4)  Wiring and cabling shall be neat and concealed within or flush to the support structure, ensuring concealment of these components to the greatest extent possible. 
(5)  Ground-mounted equipment associated with a wireless telecommunications facility shall be permitted only where consistent with the portion of the corridor in which it is to be placed, and may be required to be underground, located in alleys or otherwise shielded. In no event may ground-mounted equipment interfere with pedestrian or vehicular traffic. 
(6)  No permit shall be issued or effective unless it is shown that the wireless telecommunications facility will comply with Federal Communication Commission ("FCC") regulations governing radio frequency ("RF") emissions. Every wireless facility shall at all times comply with applicable FCC regulations governing RF emissions, and failure to comply shall be a treated as a material violation of the terms of any permit or lease. 
(7)  No towers shall be permitted in the public rights-of-way, and no wireless telecommunications facilities shall be permitted above-ground in underground areas; provided that the city may permit placements where all elements of the wireless telecommunications facility are concealed and the facility does not appear to a casual observer to be a wireless telecommunications facility. 
(8)  No permit shall be issued except to wireless service providers with immediate plans for use of the proposed wireless telecommunications facility; or wireless infrastructure providers with contracts with wireless service providers which require the service provider immediately to use the proposed wireless telecommunications facility. 
(9)  Unless appropriately placed, concealed, and designed so that the size of the facility cannot be increased except with the discretionary approval of the city, no wireless telecommunications facility is permitted in rights-of-way in historical districts, or alleys.

(Ord. No. 1877, 9-26-2016) 
Sec. 20-6.17. - Yard regulations for multifamily developments. 
(a)  In order to encourage greater flexibility in design and more attractive arrangements of buildings and greater utilization of open spaces, yard regulations for multifamily dwellings are hereby established for single development and yard regulations for locating several buildings within a group development. 
(b)  The yards of multifamily buildings shall be attractively landscaped and related to the space within the dwelling units and common areas. Buildings shall be arranged so as to assure privacy between adjacent buildings and intersecting wings of buildings, and from streets, parking and recreation areas in accordance with the following: 
(1)  The terms used in this section are defined as follows: 
a.  Single development: A development of one (1) multifamily building on one (1) lot coordinated with the surrounding neighborhood and fronting on a dedicated street. 
b.  Group development: A development of more than one (1) multifamily building on a parcel planned as a unit and coordinated with the surrounding neighborhood. 
c.  Main wall: Any exterior wall of a multifamily building containing the principal windows of a living, dining and/or sleeping room or rooms. 
d.  End or secondary wall: Any exterior wall of a multifamily building other than a main wall and containing secondary windows required for ventilation and not intended to provide a direct view. 
e.  Overlapping walls: Means that portion of the exterior walls which are directly opposite when two (2) buildings, parallel, face each other across an open yard or court. 
(2)  The minimum distance between buildings with overlapping walls or parts thereof in a group development of multifamily buildings shall be determined as follows: 
a.  In the R-30 zone, the minimum distance between main buildings shall be fifty (50) feet, provided that such distance be increased by one (1) foot for each additional one (1) foot of building height over thirty (30) feet of the taller of the two (2) buildings. 
b.  In the R-10 and R-H zones, the minimum distance between main buildings shall be fifty (50) feet, provided that such distance be increased by one (1) foot for each additional two (2) feet of building height over thirty (30) feet of the taller of the two (2) buildings. 
Minimum distance: The required minimum horizontal distance between any wall of Building "A" and the nearest wall of Building "B". 
(3)  For distance between walls of court arrangements, such minimum distances shall be determined by applying the standards set forth in Subsection (2), hereof, to each set of facing walls. 
(4)  Distance between non-overlapping walls, when the walls of two (2) buildings do not directly face each other, or do not overlap (that is where lines drawn perpendicular from the face of any one (1) wall of any one (1) building will not intersect the face of any wall of another building), the minimum horizontal distance between such buildings shall not be less than one-half (1/2) of the combined height of the two (2) buildings. 
(5)  Distance between building and property lines of a multifamily building or part thereof, in a single development shall be determined by Section 20-6.16. 
(6)  The required yards set forth in this section shall be attractively landscaped and may be used for driveways, pedestrian walks, and passive recreation areas. If, however, courts between buildings are used for parking areas or playgrounds, the distances between buildings shall be increased by the dimensions of such intermediary facilities. The site shall be designed so that entrances to all buildings shall be located not more than two hundred (200) feet from the accessory parking area, the distance to be measured along pedestrian walks. 
(7)  Building permits for multifamily dwellings shall not be issued until a final development plan has been approved by the Planning Commission. 
(8)  Cluster development. 
a.  All requests for cluster development shall require approval from the Planning Commission. 
b.  Applicant must clearly demonstrate to the Planning Commission that cluster development is better suited to the site than conventional development. 
c.  The purpose of cluster development is to provide larger open areas with greater utility for green space and recreation, and to encourage the development of more attractive and economic building forms by utilizing moderately higher standards of open space. 
d.  The minimum distance between facing and overlapping buildings or parts thereof in a cluster development of multifamily buildings shall be the same as in Subsections 20-6.17(b)(2) a. and b., with the exception that the minimum distance between main buildings shall be twenty-five (25) feet. 
e.  The average density shall be determined by the number of dwelling units which could be built under the respective zone. 
f.  Cluster development is permitted in the R-30 (low density, multifamily), R-10 (high density, multifamily), and R-H (high-rise, multifamily) zones only. 
Sec. 20-6.18. - Required yards to be maintained. 
    The required yards surrounding an existing building shall not be separated in ownership from that portion of the lot upon which the building is located, and no part shall be considered as providing a required yard for any other existing building on the same or on an adjacent lot. A yard shall not be reduced to less than the required dimensions for the zone in which it is located by enlarging an existing building, and a yard of less than the required dimensions shall be open and unobstructed from the ground upward except for accessory buildings as set forth in Section 20-6.23. and projections into yards set forth in Section 20-6.15. All parking of any vehicles, trailers, recreational vehicles, or all others shall not be stored, parked or be located on a grassed surface other than those provided for in this article. 
    In cases where the Planning Commission has determined that on street parking is an issue or in short supply, the Commission may permit a waiver of the coverage restrictions within this article on an individual basis, if the reduction results in the provision of new or additional off-street parking. Such consideration is intended for the R-5 and R-55 Zones, or other zones, which in the opinion of the Commission, necessitate such consideration. Such additions to the off-street parking by such waivers shall be approved only if the following are proposed: 
1.  Minimizing the coverage of green space through the use of grasscrete or similar materials, or the placement of asphalt or concrete strips for the car tires. 
2.  The use of gravel, unless previously approved by the Historic District Commission within their jurisdiction, is not allowed. 
3.  The placement of such parking area shall not unduly encroach into the front yard, but be placed on the side, by use of a single stall or tandem driveway. 
4.  The use of this section does not apply to the construction of enclosed garages or carports, which must comply with all provisions of this article. The driveway leading up to such structure may be the subject of a waiver. 
5.  New asphalt or concrete parking areas permitted under the provisions of this section shall plant landscaping or a fence compliant to these regulations to minimize the effect on adjoining properties. 
6.  The applicant is responsible for providing for the management of any additional stormwater or drainage that results from the increased parking area. 
Sec. 20-6.19. - Front yards of partially built-up blocks. 
    Where a building line has not been established, and where fifty (50) percent or more of the aggregate street frontage between two (2) successive intersecting streets is occupied by buildings of the type and use permitted in the zone before the effective date of this article or any amendments thereto, the minimum front yard for new buildings shall be the average setback distance of existing buildings located within one hundred (100) feet on either side of a given lot, provided, however, the depth of the front yard resulting therefrom shall be not less than one-half (1/2) of the dimensions specified in the schedule set forth in Section 20-6.16. 
Sec. 20-6.20. - Side yards of insufficient width. 
    Where side yards are narrower than required for the zone in which the buildings and lot are located and which was owned separately from all other tracts of land on the effective date of this article or any amendment thereto, and is still so owned, the building may be maintained or altered but may not be enlarged in width unless the total width of the side yards complies with these regulations or a variance is obtained. 
Sec. 20-6.21. - Yards on corner lots. 
    The depth of the front yard on a corner lot shall be not less than the required setback from the front lot line. The width of the side yard on the side street shall be the same as that of the front yard required for the adjoining lot which abuts the side street. 
Sec. 20-6.22. - Yards for irregular lots; variance required. 
    The specific yard regulations set forth in this section may be modified by the Board of Appeals in accordance with Division 4, Board of Appeals, where the regulations cannot be complied with reasonably as a result of irregular shape of lot or for topographical reasons, i.e. slopes of fifteen (15) percent or greater, land within the one hundred (100) year floodplain, or flood protection setbacks. 
Sec. 20-6.23. - Accessory structures, bulk regulations. 
    Any accessory use permitted in a residential zone may occupy a part of the main building, occupy a separate accessory building, or constitute an accessory land use. An accessory building, other than a private garage, not occupy more than twenty-five (25) percent of the rear yard. In R-T, R-30, R-18, R-10 and R-H Zones, accessory buildings may not occupy more than twenty (20) percent of the rear yard. For purposes of calculating this percentage in a corner lot rear yard, the yard shall be measured from the interior side lot line to the street right-of-way. 
(a)  Accessory building locations in P-I, R-5, R-55, and R-20 Zones. 
(1)  Any detached accessory building or detached private garage shall be located not less than ten (10) feet from the main dwelling and not less than twenty (20) feet from any dwelling on an adjacent residential lot. An open covered walkway no more than six (6) feet side may connect the main structure to the accessory structure. 
(2)  A storage building tool house, shed or other similar building used for the storage of domestic supplies, shall not project into a front or side yard, shall not exceed fifteen (15) feet in height and may be located in the rear yard but not less than three (3) feet from the side or rear property line. 
(3)  A private garage shall not project into a front yard, shall not exceed fifteen (15) feet in height, and shall be located not less than five (5) feet from the side or rear property line. 
(4)  On corner lots, any accessory building shall be set back from the side street line not less than the required setback for the adjacent main building of the abutting lot plus an additional five (5) feet. 
(5)  No detached garage shall project closer to the side street property line than the existing main building. 
(6)  In conjunction with multifamily developments, the Planning Commission may waive all setback regulations for accessory buildings at its discretion. 
(7)  In no case shall an accessory structure extend into the front yard. 
(b)  Distances from accessory uses to buildings and streets in R-T, R-30, R-18, R-10, and R-H Zones. The minimum distances from any accessory uses such as storage garages, parking areas, driveways, walks and recreation areas to certain walls of main buildings, streets and boundaries of the development area shall not be less than set forth in the schedule at the end of Section 20-6.23. 
(c)  The maximum allowed height of accessory buildings shall be fifteen (15) feet. 
(d)  Driveways and other paved parking areas used for off street parking for single-family detached dwellings in the R-5, R-55, R-20, and other zones which permit such dwellings shall not exceed twenty (20) percent of the front yard of any lot. The front yard is defined as that area from the front property line to the front plane of the dwelling, to the sidelines of the lot. This restriction is valid regardless of the total green space required for the lot. 
Unless provided for elsewhere within this article for the Planning Commission to consider a waiver, or unless the parking area and driveway has been approved within a Neo-Traditional Overlay (N-TO), Planned Unit Development-Existing (PUD-E), Planned Development Area-Existing (PDA-E), or Revitalization Overlay (RO) the twenty (20) percent paved area within the front yard shall not be exceeded. In cases of narrowness of lots, asphalt, or concrete strips may be used for off-street parking, provided the area in between the strips is maintained as grass. Additionally, PermaTURF&reg; interlocking lawn panels, or an equivalent, may be used. 
Parking areas and driveways located in the rear of lot accessed by an alley, or double side lots, or areas accessed by a front driveway which comes around the side of the house, shall not exceed twenty (20) percent of the rear area of the lot, defined as the rear lot line space to the place of the house facing such line, to the sidelines of the lot. Driveways leading to the rear of a lot for the purpose of accessing a garage, or use as a tandem driveway, must be setback a minimum of three (3) feet from the side property line. 
Driveways or parking areas (including asphalt or concrete strips) on a lot with a single-family dwelling must be setback a minimum of three (3) feet from any adjoining property line, and preferably landscaped.

SECTION 20-7. - Commercial Zones. 
Sec. 20-7.1. - Intent. 
(a)  General purposes. 
(1)  To provide in appropriate and convenient locations zoning districts of sufficient size for the exchange of goods and services and other commercial activities; 
(2)  To protect adjacent residential neighborhoods by regulating the types and spacing of business uses, particularly at the common boundaries, which would create hazards, noise, odors, or other objectionable influences; 
(3)  To encourage the tendency of commercial development to locate in concentrated groups of facilities which are mutually compatible and which have in common similar trading areas and similar frequency of use; 
(4)  To improve traffic efficiency through the maintenance of design capacities and to lessen congestion on streets, particularly in residential areas; 
(5)  To establish criteria and procedures for planned business areas so they may be coordinated with surrounding developments; and 
(6)  To promote the most desirable land use and traffic patterns in accordance with the objectives of the Master Plan and this article. 
(b)  Purposes of specific commercial zones. The function and characteristics of each of the commercial zones established by this article are intended to be as follows: 
(1)  Commercial Neighborhood Zone. The purpose of this classification is to provide a zone, which, (i) encourages the economic stability and preservation of historic commercial uses such as offices, small businesses and other trade establishments that have developed within specified older sections of the City and developed under older codes and ordinances; (ii) provides both flexibility and control in their continuance through modification options exercised by the Planning Commission, and (iii) allows improvement and expansion where the uses, both existing and proposed, have no detrimental effect on adjoining commercial or residential properties which have developed largely in existing structures whose reconversion to residential use is unlikely. Properties placed in the Commercial Neighborhood Zones may also be locations for mixed use, in order to fulfill the housing goals of the duly adopted Master Plan such as establishing housing opportunities for the elderly and the handicapped. The following shall be the specific intents of the Neighborhood Commercial Zone: 
a.  To recognize businesses which have evolved and which are largely contained in the City's Historic District areas or immediate environs. 
b.  To provide a mechanism to control the expansion of these uses. 
c.  To allow infill development where such expansion may be appropriate and compatible with surrounding properties. 
d.  To recognize and permit the continuance of small yard regulations. 
e.  To insure that resulting rehabilitation, renovation or new construction is in character with surrounding neighborhoods, which shall involve coordination, where applicable, with the Historic District Commission. 
(2)  Commercial Community Zone. The purpose of this classification is to provide locations for predominantly retail commercial shopping facilities for a substantially wider service area than those provided for in the Commercial Neighborhood Zone, yet not containing the fuller range of commercial activities which characterize and justify the Commercial General Zone. Consequently, many open uses are excluded in order to ensure the tight, pedestrian-oriented character which typifies a shopping precinct or because they are incompatible with the proper functioning of type of commercial node. 
(3)  Commercial General Zone. The purpose of this classification is to provide locations for general retail commercial activities. These activities are those associated with a large trade area, serving a large portion of the regional area. The list of permitted uses excludes those uses which are considered incompatible with general retail functions. Where possible, land classified in this zone should be located on roads carrying large volumes of traffic; be grouped in concentrations of relatively large areas and narrow frontage; have few points of highway access; and concentrations should be relatively far apart. 
(4)  Commercial Shopping Center Zone. The purpose of this classification is to provide zones, where compatible commercial facilities, with functional relationships, will be planned, organized and grouped in a building or in a unified arrangement of buildings and service facilities all designed on a designated area of sufficient dimensions to satisfy all off-street parking demands and located along major arterial streets where the traffic generated by such development can be accommodated in a manner that the public health, welfare, and safety of the surrounding area will be maintained. 
(5)  Commercial Village Zone. The purpose of this classification is to provide for a zone which, (i) encourages the economic stability and improvement of the Main Street Business Area and its immediate environs, (ii) furthers the improvement and retention of the historic character of the Main Street Business District through modification options of the City Planning Commission guidelines on historic preservation of the Historic District Commission, (iii) encourages the continuation and establishment of small business, office uses, skilled craft occupations, and entertainment facilities along with certain residential uses, which are appropriate to the scale and existing character of the Main Street Business Area, (iv) encourages mixed use of permitted uses appropriate to the Business District. 
It shall be the specific intent of the Commercial Village Zone to be utilized where historic development of the business district uses formed a pattern of buildings and other features that would be disrupted by a standard zoning category intended for highway uses. Its placement is intended where established building patterns have been developed and new development, rehabilitation, or other improvement proposals face practical hardships due to their inability through conventional zoning to be compatible with the existing character of the district. The placement of any property within the Commercial Village Zone infers the use of modification procedures through the Planning Commission to alleviate undue hardship relating to parking restrictions, setback, and other yard requirements necessary to maintain the existing character of the Business District. 
(6)  Commercial Village Activity Center Zone. The purpose of this classification is to provide locations where localized retail, service commercial, and employment opportunities can be located to serve an existing population, or located where approved residential development is programmed to serve an area within a two (2) to four (4) mile radius. The zone can also provide locations to serve as a town center for residential development, located within walking distance to offer easy access to stores, services, and employment uses located within the zone.

In addition, standards provide for connections between adjacent sites, where feasible. 
(2)  Qualifying types of development. This regulation applies to all new nonresidential development and remodeling projects that exceed fifty (50) percent of the structure's assessed value. Assessed value shall be determined by reference to the official property tax assessment rolls of the year the structure is to be remodeled.

ii.  Where the system crosses driveways, parking areas and loading areas, the system must be clearly identifiable through the use of elevation changes, speed bumps, different paving materials, or other similar method. Striping does not meet this requirement. 
iii.  Where the system is parallel and adjacent to a motor vehicle travel lane, the system must be a raised path or be separated from the lane by a raised curb, bollards, landscaping or other physical barrier. If a raised path is used the ends of the raised portions must be equipped with curb ramps. 
c.  Lighting. The on-site pedestrian circulation system must be lighted to a level where the employees, residents, visitors and customers can use the system at night. Lighting shall be in accordance with the Department of Public Works period lighting program.

SECTION 20-13. - REVITALIZATION OVERLAY AREAS. 
Sec. 20-13.1. - Purpose and intent. 
    It shall be the purpose and intent of Revitalization Overlay (RO) to be an alternative form of development or redevelopment designed to: 
(a)  Create additional economic development opportunities for property owners within the City of Laurel to upgrade, enhance, demolish or revitalize their properties using additional flexibility offered the overlay zone, by, among others, offering superior amenities, land uses, or achieving superior land design to warrant intensification or increased density of properties in areas that are targeted for their potential for economic development. 
(b)  Enhance the redevelopment of the business corridors within the City of Laurel, and to allow the upgrading of various housing opportunities, which, by their age or state of disrepair, have become obsolete, increasingly vacant, or become contributing to destabilizing property values within the City. 
(c)  Enhance opportunities for improvements to the retail, housing, employment or entertainment offerings within the City limits, which are necessary to maintain economic balance and continued prosperity of the City. 
(d)  Allow for increased, consolidated, or integrated development in order to meet the need for certain targeted land uses, which may be deficient or missing within the current marketplace. 
(e)  Permit the development for a hierarchy of overlay types, which reflect the location and conditions contained within specific areas within the City. 
(f)  The conditions and restrictions of such an overlay is considered an optional form of development, which is in addition to the land uses and restrictions contained within the base zoning of any property located within a revitalization overlay. 
(g)  Acknowledge that the development and approval of any revitalization overlay zone is a unique and specific approval to a unique parcel of groups of parcels, whose approval is conditioned upon meeting the objectives and specific goals of using such an overlay option. 
(h)  Facilitate redevelopment and provisions of specific land uses, configurations, which are recommended for the continued development and economic health, well-being and stability of the neighborhoods of the City. 
(i)  Allow intensification or changes in land uses, mixes of land uses, and access based on the ability of the provision of municipal and other public services, the general adequacy of transportation capacity to accomplish such development approvals as deemed necessary by the Mayor and City Council. 
(j)  Retain the stability of the retail, restaurant, and entertainment establishments by providing development consistent with the demographics and income characteristics of City residents, and the reduce the exportation of the consumer spending potential of City residents by providing improved offerings to retain the spending by City residents for consumer products and services within City limits, where possible. 
(k)  Encourage integrated development, consolidation of properties, in order to reduce access points to major highways; reduce visual confusion inherent in older commercial highway corridors such as U.S. Route 1. 
(l)  Increase the attractiveness of the City for the potential of its potential in the areas of employment creation, tourism development, and improvements to its retail and restaurant offerings for business development, stabilization and improvement of its neighborhoods. 
(m)  Create a stable redevelopment of the core area of the existing City limits, to make potential annexation of areas which may petition the City to compliment the core area by providing complimentary land uses to build on existing development. 
(n)  Revitalization overlays are not permitted by right, but reflect a negotiated development agreement that is unique to a specific proposal, or development that reflects the applicant's ability to achieve the goals and objectives of this alternative form of development. The Mayor and City Council is not obligated to approve any form of optional development if it concludes that the proposal does not meet with the purpose and intent of these regulations. Approvals within any overlay do not usurp or diminish the jurisdiction of the City's Historic District Commission, if the overlay is located within their jurisdiction. 
(o)  Setbacks of any type will not be waived, modified, or amended unless alternate methods will provide equal or superior protection to surrounding uses. 
(p)  To conclude that the use of this overlay option does not diminish, modify, or in any way alter the applicant's right to development their property using the conventional base zone affixed to the property. 
Sec. 20-13.2. - Types and location of revitalization overlay areas. 
(a)  Because of the distinct nature of sections of the City, which may be located within a revitalization area, RO Zones shall be distinguished by the characteristics or goals of the area in which they are located. The general description of the proposed function of each area is as follows: 
(b)  R0-1, City center overlay area. The overlay encompassing this area shall reflect an intensity, which would permit the highest potential for a comprehensive and integrated redevelopment of uses which include, but are not limited to retail, restaurant, entertainment, major employment, professional offices, and commercial services. They may also include immediately adjacent multifamily complexes. Ideally, these uses would be located within an integrated complex or complexes, which may contain structured parking and comprehensively designed access points, directional signage, and other amenities to allow intensification above the base density of the parcel or parcels in which they are located. Examples of targeted or desired land uses within the City center overlay include but are not limited to the following: 
•  Retail, including apparel, traditional department stores, specialty apparel and shoe stores, as well as establishments selling electronic, computer and telecommunication products. 
•  Entertainment, specifically multi-plex cinemas, which utilize state-of-the-art technology, design, and amenities. Karaoke when in conjunction with a standard restaurant. All other entertainments facilities must be included within a set of uses approved by the Mayor and City Council in conjunction with a conceptual plan of revitalization overlay. 
•  Restaurants, full service sit-down facilities, delicatessens and other specialty food retailers, which may include prepared food in a retail setting, providing they are not freestanding. 
•  Employment uses, including research, general office, financial firms, and the like, which may contain ancillary retail, restaurant and commercial services facilities within their building, or be located above, retail complexes or entertainment facilities. 
•  Housing, which would primarily consist of upscale rental apartments or condominiums, generally located above the aforementioned facilities, or integrated into a mixed-use complex. 
•  Employment agency/recruitment firm. 
(c)  R0-2, Highway corridor or activity nodes. The area utilizing this overlay would consist primarily of properties, which line the U.S. Route One area, or along MD 198. These parcels are usually characterized by their lack of property depth, and generally consist of smaller properties which all maintain separate highway access. However, they may also contain existing shopping centers of moderate size. The overlay is specifically recommended to encourage the consolidation of these properties, where possible, and to create mixed-use business and residential complexes, especially in the bifurcated sections of U.S. Route One, where multiple access points have created issues of public safety, given the volume of traffic volume and speed on this facility. Recommended uses for the properties in this overlay would be as follows: 
•  Retail facilities, either freestanding, or accessory uses located within a mixed-use complex or structure. 
•  Restaurants, preferable full service, located within mixed-use complexes, which may include karaoke establishments, subject to the definition and restrictions on such use in conjunction with a standard restaurant. 
•  Professional and business offices. 
•  Accessory apartments located on upper floors of mixed-use complexes. 
•  Employment agency/recruitment firm. 
(d)  R0-3, Route One Historic District and gateway approaches. 
•  This overlay area is unique and defined generally as the area along U.S. Route 1 from the Howard County line southward. This area is specifically recommended for development of transit-oriented development, which relates to services and establishments, as well as housing, that would benefit from being in close proximity to the MARC Rail station of the Camden Line of the Maryland Transit Administration. Typical uses recommended for this area include the following: 
•  Retail and commercial service uses located within mixed-use complexes which may be designed to serve, among others, the rail commuters, bus users, or others within the Main Street business district. 
•  Offices and other business establishments typically located within mixed-use structures. 
•  Ancillary rental apartments and condominiums, typically located above commercial establishments. This could also include high density attached housing as well. 
•  Employment agency/recruitment firm. 
(e)  RO-4, Existing multifamily and attached housing areas. 
•  These areas are generally characterized as older multifamily facilities located adjacent or in close proximity to commercial complexes and along arterial roadways. 
•  Land uses within these areas are generally limited to housing, specifically rental apartment communities. 
•  To balance and upgrade its housing stock in these areas, redevelopment of existing facilities is encouraged and additional density may be allowed subject to meeting the intent and purpose of these regulations. 
•  While generally discouraged, circumstances may permit the inclusion of certain convenience retail facilities, although a commercial complex in the immediate vicinity generally meets these needs. 
(f)  RO-5, Main Street historic area and neighborhood commercial nodes. 
•  This area is defined as being the limits of Main Street from those properties, which do not face U.S. Route One westerly until MD 216, or Seventh Street. It also includes areas zoned for Commercial Neighborhood uses, which are presently used for commercial and services uses. The intent of the overlay zone is somewhat diminished in this area, because the flexibility of the Commercial Village Zone, for those properties along Main Street which are contained within the zone, already contain flexibility in area, yard, and parking regulations. However, it is intended that they benefit from the potential flexibilities of the overlay which relate to, among others: 
•  Inclusion of additional apartments above permitted commercial buildings. 
•  Other future financial incentives offered the City, county, or state. 
•  Employment agency/recruitment firm. 
•  Karaoke establishments, in conjunction with a standard restaurant, and subject to uses currently in the Commercial Village Zone, and subject to the definitions and restrictions for such uses. 
(g)  R0-6, Patuxent River transit-oriented development overlay. This specific area is defined by side streets along Main Street, beginning on the west by Avondale Street, and continuing easterly including "C", "B", and "A" Streets. The intent of the specificity of this area is to encourage redevelopment of the area in order to: 
•  Create redevelopment opportunities which serve to reconnect the Main Street business community with its Patuxent River origins. 
•  Allow mixed-use development to exploit the increased use of the Riverfront Park without any environmental effects of new development. 
•  Explore the potential for additional restaurant development along the river. 
•  Develop additional business and housing opportunities to reinforce Main Street business development and increased business expansion which complements the Main Street community. 
•  Recommended land uses for this area could include inclusion of an arts and entertainment district (in addition to Main Street). 
•  Establishments for artisans and craftsmen, artists, or galleries exhibiting products for sale. 
•  Rental or condominium apartments, with provisions for at home occupations, limited professional uses, or specialty shops. 
•  Employment agency/recruitment firm. 
Sec. 20-13.3. - Development standards for all revitalization overlay areas. 
(a)  It shall be the intent of all overlay areas, that the purpose and intent be met before this optional form of development can be approved. Provisions of additional amenities or the modification of certain development standards shall be based on the conclusion of the Mayor and City Council by, that the proposed development or complex, sufficiently meets the intent of this option. The following elements contained within conventional development regulations for modification, among others, may be considered:

•  Building materials. 
•  Targeted tenants or uses, such as stadium-style seating cinema complexes, upscale restaurants, other entertainment venues, traditional department stores, and other specialty stores selling apparel, books, electronics, food products, and the like. 
•  Innovative designs for mixed-use complexes. 
•  Under grounding of utilities on site and in the adjacent public right-of-way. 
•  Public or scenic spaces, including plazas, fountains or water features and public sculpture or murals. 
•  Provision of current technology, "smart buildings", and Internet access, including entertainment facilities for workers, residents, or the public. 
•  Upscale multifamily, attached, or detached housing, mixed with other uses or stand-alone. 
•  Provision for transit facilities. 
Sec. 20-13.4. - Process for the consideration of a conceptual development proposal within any overlay area. 
(a)  Applicants submitting a proposal for development utilizing the revitalization overlay shall submit a plan in accordance with the Zoning Regulations for revitalization overlay areas, in accordance with the provisions of this article. In addition, the plan(s) shall contain the following: 
•  A traffic and circulation plan. 
•  Plan for re-subdivision (for consolidations). 
•  A specific plan for the uses and their design. 
•  A phasing schedule, if a multi-phase development is planned. 
•  Other studies or plans deemed necessary by the Department of Community Planning and Business Services, as recommended to the Planning Commission. 
(b)  After review of a completed application or proposal, the Department of Community Planning and Business Services shall prepare a technical staff report, analyzing the compliance of the applicant's proposal with the intent and purpose of utilizing revitalization zones. The report shall be transmitted to the Planning Commission, who shall hold a public hearing for recommendation to the Mayor and City Council. The requirements for notifying the public of such proposals, including sign posting, shall be the same as that required by the Zoning Regulations for map amendment application. 
(c)  Upon receipt of the recommendation of the Planning Commission and staff technical report, the Mayor and City Council shall schedule a review of the proposal and schedule two (2) public hearings on such proposal, including a specific notification to Prince George's County, the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, and the Maryland Department of State Planning. After the second public hearing, the Mayor and City Council can approve, reject, or modify the development request for the revitalization overlay option. If the decision of the Mayor and City Council is for approval, such action is a conceptual approval that will enable the applicant to prepare a final site and landscape plan that incorporates all conditions and requirements imposed by the Mayor and City Council at concept stage for review and approval by the Planning Commission. 
(d)  Revitalization overlay conceptual approval shall expire three (3) years from the date of such approval unless the Planning Commission has approved a final revitalization overlay area plan, i.e. a final site and landscape plan. The period may be extended for an additional one (1) year by the Director of the Department of Community Planning and Business Services for good cause.

(2)  A thorough explanation of the basis of the estimate; and 
(3)  Any data used in calculating the estimate, including parking generation studies such as those from the Urban Land Institute (ULI), the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) or based on data collated from uses or combination of uses which are the same or comparable to the proposed use. Comparability shall be determined by density, scale, bulk, are, type of activity, and location. Any parking study proposing different parking requirements shall document the source data used to develop the recommendation. 
(Ord. No. 1744, 7-23-2012; Ord. No. 1844, 4-27-2015) 
Sec. 20-16.6. - Modifications of requirements. 
(a)  Public facilities available. The required spaces as determined by the above schedule and standards may be modified by the Planning Commission where: 
(1)  Free parking areas or publicly owned parking areas as located within five hundred (500) feet of the nearest boundary of the lot on which the use is located; and 
(2)  Land is not available for development of accessory off-street parking as required herein; and 
(3)  Public transportation issued extensively, or in the case of a building or use located or proposed in an area of a specified established business district; 
(4)  After a public hearing the Mayor and City Council have find that practical difficulties or undue hardship prevent the strict application of these requirements in that established area as shown in Appendix D. "Parking Modification Zone". 
(b)  Parking for single and mixed uses. A building occupied by one (1) use shall provide the off-street parking space as required for the specific use. Except in the M-X-T Zone or Revitalization Overlay Areas, a building or group of buildings, occupied by two (2) or more uses, operating normally during the same hours, shall provide spaces for not less than the sum of the spaces required for each use. For a large development of business uses, such as a community or regional shopping center, spaces shall be provided for the total area of the building or buildings as set forth in such schedule instead of the requirements based on each separate use. 
(c)  Joint use of parking facilities. Houses of worship, civic clubs, community centers, auditoriums, lodge halls, gymnasiums and stadiums may make arrangements with business establishments which normally have different hours of operation for sharing up to, but not more than fifty (50) percent of their requirements in adjacent parking areas which are accessory to such commercial uses. However, where there is a sharing of facilities by different owners or tenants, there shall be an agreement covering a specific period of time as may be required by the Planning Commission. Should any of the uses be changed or the facilities discontinued then the required spaces for the use or uses remaining shall be provided elsewhere as a condition precedent to the continued use of said building or buildings. In addition, the following may be allowed: 
(1)  The off-street parking requirements for two (2) or more noncommercial institutional or house of worship uses may be satisfied by providing a joint parking lot. The normal space requirement for each use participating in a joint lot may be reduced to the greater of the total number of spaces required for any one (1) use provided only one (1) use utilizes the parking lot at any given time. 
(2)  The normal parking space requirement for each use participating in a joint lot, when the uses operate at the same time, may be reduced by up to twenty (20) percent provided: 
a.  The normal requirement for each use is not more than twenty (20) spaces. 
b.  The total of these reductions does not exceed forty (40) spaces. 
c.  The above will apply regardless of whether the uses are located in one (1) or more buildings. 
(d)  Shared parking. 
(1)  Except in the M-X-T Zone or Revitalization Overlay Areas, the off-street parking for two (2) or more uses may be satisfied by providing a joint parking lot. The normal parking space requirement for each use participating in a joint lot may be reduced by up to twenty (20) percent, provided: 
a.  The normal requirement for each use is not more than twenty (20) spaces; and 
b.  The total of these reductions does not exceed forty (40) spaces. 
c.  Where the uses have different hours or demand for parking. 
(2)  The uses participating may be located in one (1) or more buildings. 
(3)  This section does not apply to integrated shopping centers having a gross leasable area of twenty-five thousand (25,000) or more square feet, office buildings, office-building complexes, or medical or dental offices. 
(e)  Hardship; practical difficulties. These regulations regarding area, yard, parking and setback requirements may be modified by the Planning Commission, when a specific lot or lots (parcels of land), structure, or use is located in a specifically established commercial area where the Mayor and City Council has resolved after a public hearing that practical difficulties and possible undue hardship prevents the strict application of these requirements within that established area. 
(f)  Parking modification zones. Parking reductions described below shall only apply to parking modification zones that have been approved by the Mayor and City Council. 
Building and Use Parking Reduction Amusement and recreational services 50% Apparel/furniture store 50% Boarding, rooming, or lodging house 35% Community facilities/private 50% House of worship 50% Office uses 30% Restaurant 100% Retail < 5.000 sq. ft. 60% School for artistic or technical instruction and practice 50% School for business, art, music, and similar uses 25% Services 50% Single-family and multifamily 1 space per dwelling unit

(Ord. No. 1877, 9-26-2016) 
Sec. 20-16.7. - Continuation of facilities. 
(a)  Off-street parking and loading facilities accessory to an existing use on January 1, 1990, and those required as accessory to a use created or a building constructed or altered thereafter, shall be continued and maintained in operation, and shall not be used for automobile sales, service or repair of motor vehicles, and shall not be reduced below the requirements of these regulations during the period that the main use is maintained, unless an equivalent number of spaces shall be provided for such use in another approved location. 
(b)  Wherever parking facilities are permitted on land other than the zoned lot on which the building or use served is located, and such facilities shall be in the same ownership as the zoning lot occupied by the building or use to which the parking facilities are accessory. Such ownership shall be by deed or a long term lease agreement, whereby the owner of the land on which the parking facilities are to be located shall be bound by a covenant filed and recorded in the office of the county recorder, requiring each such owner, his heirs or assigns to maintain the required number of parking facilities for the duration of the use served as a precedent to the continuation of such use. 
Sec. 20-16.8. - Location of facilities. 
    Accessory parking facilities shall be provided at locations as set forth herein except as modified by Sections 20-16.6 and 20-16.7 of this division. 
(a)  Residential zones and uses: 
(1)  Accessory, enclosed or open parking facilities as required shall be provided on the same lot as the dwelling unit served. 
(2)  Any multifamily garage serving a multifamily building over three (3) stories in height, and apartment garages in the R-H and R-10 zones, shall form part of the main multifamily building and the yard regulations of Section 20-6, Residential Zones shall apply to such multifamily building and garage as one (1) building, provided that if such garage does not exceed a height of over five (5) feet above the finished grade and the entire roof is landscaped it may occupy any side or rear yard but shall be located not closer than five (5) feet to a side or rear lot line and twelve (12) feet to any main or end wall of a building. 
(3)  In the R-30 and R-18 zones, the enclosed garage space may be detached from the main building and each enclosed garage shall contain no more than twelve (12) parking spaces. 
(b)  Civic uses and places of assembly. 
(1)  Where houses of worship, civic clubs, community centers, auditoriums, lodge halls, gymnasiums and stadiums share parking facilities with adjacent business establishments, such parking facilities shall be located within a walking distance of not more than two hundred fifty (250) feet from the entrance of the main building of such use. 
(c)  Commercial and office uses. 
(1)  Accessory parking facilities shall be provided on the same lot as the main use served in a commercial zone, except where modified by the Planning Commission in accordance with the provisions of Section 20-16.6. In such cases, the nearest point of the parking lot shall be located within walking distance of not more than two hundred fifty (250) feet from the main entrance of the building served. 
(2)  A parking area serving the uses covered in this subsection shall be further regulated in relation to any adjoining residential zone lines as set forth in Section 20-7.10, Commercial Zones-Yard Regulations. 
Sec. 20-16.9. - Parking limitations for service stations. 
    Unenclosed parking of motor vehicles at automotive service stations shall be limited to two (2) vehicles for each service bay, with not more than a maximum of four (4) vehicles remaining so parked for any period exceeding forty-eight (48) hours. 
Sec. 20-16.10. - Parking area improvements. 
    Parking areas and access driveways shall be designed, graded, constructed, altered, and maintained as follows: 
(a)  Grading and pavement. Parking areas and access driveways shall be graded and drained so that surface water shall not be allowed to flow onto adjacent properties. Parking areas and driveways shall be improved with asphaltic concrete, Portland cement pavement or another material which the Planning Commission determines is acceptable and in conformance with the intent of this chapter, in accordance with the standards established in Subdivision Regulations, Building Code, or any other City regulation or standard. 
The Planning Commission may consider or require alternate paving methods, such as pervious or semi-pervious materials that are meant to: 
(1)  Increase the infiltration of runoff, which is the rate that runoff penetrates the surface before reaching the soil. 
(2)  Facilitate the absorption of runoff into the underlying sub base, which is the material lying directly beneath the paving surface. 
(3)  Each proposal shall be considered separately, given the intended use of the road, parking area or driveway, and shall not conflict with approved stormwater management plans, as well as any relating to soil erosion and sedimentation control plans. Specific types of materials, such as porous surfaces, inter-locking pavers, and all others, shall be considered for the frequency of use, ability to safely allow pedestrian use, or other factors deemed necessary by the Planning Commission. 
(4)  Any alternate proposal may not conflict with any federal, state, county, or City standards or regulations concerning roadways, parking areas, driveway, aprons from public right-of-ways, or any other applicable standard. All proposals shall be reviewed for such compliance by the City Department of Public Works. 
(b)  Design of areas. Parking areas shall be so arranged and marked to provide for orderly and safe parking and storage of vehicles in accordance with the aforesaid parking area design standards. All parking bays shall be properly marked and well defined. The Planning Commission may also require screening between such parking areas and a side or rear lot line of a residential zone in accordance with standards established in other sections of this chapter. Interior landscaping must equal four (4) percent of the area of the total parking lot. 
(c)  Maintenance. The owner of property used for parking and/or loading shall maintain such area in good repair and shall at all times keep said area clearly marked for parking lanes and parking spaces, such that the off-street parking facility is harmonious with the intent of this article. 
(d)  Signs. Signs located on or related to parking areas shall be limited to those indicating the operator, purpose or business served, or instructions for parking. If a sign is located on the paved surface of a parking area, that space or spaces upon which the sign is located shall not be included in the number of spaces required for a use by this section. 
(e)  Required trash areas. All commercial, industrial, and multifamily residential uses that provide trash and/or garbage collection areas shall be screened from residential units if such area is not within an enclosed building or structure. Provisions for adequate vehicular access to and from such area or areas for collection of trash and/or garbage as determined by the Commission shall be required. 
(f)  Disabled vehicles. In any zone, the storage of any motor vehicle for a period in excess of fourteen (14) days is prohibited when such vehicle is wrecked, partially dismantled, or inoperable, that is incapable of being moved under its own automotive power. This section shall not apply to one (1) wrecked, partially dismantled, or inoperable vehicle, which is kept in a wholly enclosed garage, repair facility, towing station, or the like, as otherwise provided by this article. 
The chief of police or his designee shall be authorized to issue the municipal infraction citation for a violation of this section, in addition to the Director of the Department of Community Planning and Business Services or his designee who is otherwise authorized to issue such citations as to infractions of the article generally. 
(g)  Surface parking lots that are pervious or permeable, to reduce run-off, are encouraged but not mandated. 
Sec. 20-16.11. - Illumination of parking areas. 
    Parking areas shall be illuminated wherever the Planning Commission determines that such illumination is necessary to insure the public safety. Lighting fixtures shall be designed and located so as not to cast direct rays of excessive brightness upon adjoining residential zones or cause a glare hazardous to pedestrians or auto drivers on adjacent public streets. Parking lot illumination shall conform to the lighting design standards established by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO). 
Sec. 20-16.12. - Driveways to parking areas. 
(a)  The location, width, and number of entrance and exit driveways serving accessory parking facilities, drive-in businesses, fee parking lots and public parking lots, shall be planned in such a manner as to interfere as little as possible with the use of adjacent property, and the flow of traffic on the streets to which they connect. 
(b)  Parking areas, of up to twenty (20) spaces shall have no more than one (1) two-lane driveway located at least fifty (50) feet from the right-of-way line of the nearest uncontrolled (i.e., no stop sign or signal) intersection street. On stop-controlled or signalized intersection the minimum driveway distance shall be two hundred (200) feet or the furthest egress location on the property from the intersection. Driveways should be oriented to egress on the lower volume street if the property abuts more than one (1) street. 
(c)  Parking areas of more than twenty (20) spaces shall have two (2) two-lane driveways located not less than two hundred (200) feet from the right-of-way line of the nearest intersecting street. 
(d)  Entrance or exit driveways shall not exceed three (3) lanes in width and be designed so that all cars can be driven forward into the street. The width of such driveways, measured at the street right-of-way line, shall conform to the following schedule: 
Width of Driveway 
Number of Lanes Minimum (feet) Maximum (feet) One 10 12 Two 20 24 Three 30 36  
(e)  The angle of intersection between the driveway and the street shall be between seventy (70) degrees and ninety (90) degrees for a distance of at least twenty-five (25) feet. The radii of the edge of the driveway apron shall be at least twenty-five (25) feet. 
(f)  In all residential developments, interior subdivision roads and parking aisles within such developments shall be no less than thirty (30) feet wide. 
(g)  In order to reduce the number of driveways, driveways that are located too close together, or too close to an intersection, driveways shall be consolidated during new or reconstruction projects in order to decrease the number of conflict points. 
Sec. 20-16.13. - Loading facilities. 
(a)  Generally. Accessory loading and unloading facilities shall be provided as a condition precedent to occupancy of all commercial, office, service, and industrial buildings hereafter erected and altered, and shall be maintained as long as such building is occupied or unless equivalent facilities are provided in conformance with the regulations of this section. 
(b)  Allocation of use. Space required and allocated for any off-street loading facility shall not, while so allocated be used to satisfy the space requirements for off-street parking. An off-street loading space shall not be used for repairing or servicing motor vehicles. 
(c)  Location of facility. 
(1)  All required accessory loading facilities shall be related to the building and use to be served to provide for loading of delivery trucks and other service vehicles and shall be so arranged that they may be used without blocking or otherwise interfering with the use of access ways, parking facilities, public streets or sidewalks. 
(2)  A required loading space in an industrial zone shall not face, or be visible from the frontage street, and shall not be located in a required front yard, or a required side or rear yard if adjoining a residential zone. 
(3)  If a loading space is entirely enclosed, it may be located in such side or rear yard if approved by the Planning Commission. 
(d)  Access driveways.

(a)  Signs which were legally existing, pursuant to previous regulations on January 1, 1993, but which do not conform to the provisions of this division may be eligible for the designation "legal nonconforming" provided that:

(3)  There is a change in the name, trade name or, nature of the business identified by the sign or a change in the principal use of the premises identified by the sign. 
(c)  A legal nonconforming sign is subject to all requirements of this division regarding safety, maintenance, and repair. However, if the sign suffers more than fifty (50) percent damage or deterioration, as based on appraisal, it must be brought into conformance with this division or be removed. If, however, the Planning Commission concludes that the damaged sign evinces uniquely historical, architectural or aesthetic qualities, such that the loss of the sign would have an adverse impact on the community as a whole, then such damaged sign may be restored to its original appearance, provided that materials exist which can, in fact, restore the sign to its original appearance. The Planning Commission shall only make such conclusion based upon an application for modification filed with the Commission in accordance with Subsection 20-17.7(g), Modifications, of this division. Prior to ordering such removal of a sign or ordering that the sign be brought into conformance with this division, pursuant to this subsection, the Director of the Department of Community Planning and Business Services shall issue an order directed to the owner of the premises on which such sign is located, and also to the user of the sign, if different from the owner, requiring such person or persons to show cause why such sign should not be brought into conformance or removed within the time specified in that order, as set forth herein.

When obsolete signs are removed on the face of a building, the area should be restored to match the surrounding area. 
(e)  Amortization. Nonconforming signs which do not comply with the provisions of this division shall be brought into compliance on or before January 1, 2018, unless waived, or modified by the Planning Commission in accordance with the provisions of Subsection 20-17.7(g), Modifications.

A modification may be granted by the Commission where the literal application of this division would create a particular hardship for the sign user and all of the following criteria are met: 
a.  A strict application of this division would result in a peculiar hardship due to substantial impairment of visibility, or other site factors which are unique to the property, or there are unique physical conditions or exceptional topographic conditions peculiar to the property, not created or allowed by the owner or applicant, on which the sign is to be located, including the location of existing buildings and other structures, irregular or unusual narrowness or shallowness of the lot, irregularity of the road right-of-way, which conditions lead to a practical difficulty and undue hardship in complying strictly with the provisions of this division. 
b.  The granting of the requested variance would not be detrimental to the property owners in the vicinity. 
c.  The hardship does not apply generally to other locations in the City. 
d.  The modification would not result in an undue concentration of signs in the immediate vicinity, would not cause visual confusion, and would not be detrimental to public safety and visibility, and

(2)  In granting a modification, the Planning Commission may impose additional requirements necessary to carry out the spirit and purpose of this division in the public interest. 
(3)  In appropriate situations, the Planning Commission may consider existing historical, architectural, or aesthetic features of the sign, or environmental features of the site, which would be adversely affected by a strict application of this division. 
(4)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this section, no modification may be granted by the Planning Commission, pursuant to this section, if such hardship was self-imposed by the applicant. For the purposes of this section, a hardship shall be deemed to be "self-imposed" if the alleged hardship was proximately caused by the action or omission of the applicant or his agent. 
(5)  The following conditions or considerations shall not constitute hardships or unique conditions which favor a modification: 
a.  Guidelines or requirements of the Historic District Commission; 
b.  Existing signs, whether conforming, legally nonconforming, or otherwise, in the vicinity of the subject sign, with which the subject sign might compete, or be compared with, in terms of size, aesthetics, or otherwise.

(2)  The application is not acceptable for filing because filed within eighteen (18) months as in this division heretofore provided; or 
(3)  The application is frivolous or filed for purpose of harassment.

No application for a map amendment shall be approved for a greater area than that applied for but an application may be approved for a smaller area than that applied for if the reclassification of such smaller area is supported by the evidence of record and if such smaller area is accurately delineated in the record. 
(b)  The decision of the Mayor and City Council approving, modifying, denying, or dismissing any application for a Zoning Map or text amendment shall be rendered within sixty (60) days of the original hearing (unless such time is extended by resolution of the Mayor and City Council), and shall be in the form of a resolution adopted by the Mayor and City Council in open session by a majority of those voting on roll call by yeas and nays and appearing in the minutes of the meeting, and a copy of the resolution shall be promptly mailed by the City Clerk to the applicant and to all persons entering their appearance at the hearing as shown by the hearing transcript.

The petition may be granted by resolution of the Mayor and City Council for good cause shown and, if granted, the decision of the Mayor and City Council may be rescinded and the application thereafter by resolution of the Mayor and City Council approved, modified, denied or dismissed with or without further hearing, as may be required by law. Pending further hearing if ordered, the decision may be suspended by resolution of the Mayor and City Council. Any resolution under this subsection shall be subject to the limitations on voting, on mailing or furnishing copies applicable to resolutions adopted under Subsection (b) of this section. Nothing herein shall prevent the Mayor and City Council from reconsidering any decision on its own motion. 
Sec. 20-24.10. - Conditional zoning. 
    In approving any zoning map amendment the Mayor and City Council may give consideration to and adopt such reasonable requirements, safeguards, and conditions (hereinafter referred to as "conditions") as may in its opinion be necessary either to protect surrounding properties from adverse effects which might accrue from such zoning map amendment or which would further enhance the coordinated, harmonious, and systematic development of the City of Laurel; but, in no case, shall such conditions waive or lessen the requirements specifically set forth in the applicable zoning classification granted. 
(a)  The applicant may in his application consent to conditions believed to be desirable for the consideration of the Planning Commission and the Mayor and City Council. Conditions consented to by the applicant in the application, or in the evidence adduced before the Mayor and City Council, shall be binding if imposed by the City Council. Conditions adopted by the City Council shall become a permanent adjunct to the Zoning Map amendment and shall be binding so long as the zoning category granted by the Mayor and City Council shall remain in effect. 
(b)  When a zoning amendment is approved subject to adopted conditions, the applicant shall have ninety (90) days from the date of approval to accept or reject the land use classification as conditionally approved. The Mayor and City Council's action shall be final upon entry of an order, incorporating the acceptance or rejection of the land use classification as conditionally approved. Failure to advise in writing within such period of such acceptance or rejection shall be deemed a rejection thereof. Rejection shall have the effect of voiding the zoning amendment and reverting the property to its prior zoning classification. Provided, however, that should a timely appeal to the Circuit Court for Prince George's County be filed by the applicant contesting the authority of the Mayor and City Council to impose specific conditions: the ninety (90) day period within which the applicant may accept or reject the land use classification as conditionally approved shall be stayed and the applicant shall thereafter have ninety (90) days from the dismissal or final adjudication of such appeal within which to accept or reject the land use classification as conditionally approved. 
(c)  All conditions imposed by the Mayor and City Council shall be mandatory and the failure to comply with any condition shall constitute a zoning violation and shall be grounds for the Mayor and City Council to completely annul the zoning amendment; to revoke a use and occupancy permit; to institute appropriate civil or criminal proceedings or any other action necessary to obtain compliance. All building plans shall list the zoning conditions and shall reflect details, indicating compliance. 
(d)  All zoning map amendments which are granted by the Mayor and City Council, subject to conditions shall be designated on the Zoning Map with the letter "C" after the application number.

(1)  Size, scale, placement on the site, roof design, and materials should be compatible with the main structure. 
(2)  The visual impact of proposed structures on the site and streetscape. 
(b)  Accessory structures should be in character with other such structures located within the neighborhood. Size is dependent on factors such as lot size, relative placement on the lot, and visibility. 
Sec. 20-26.8. - Additions. 
    See Section 20-26.21, New construction. 
Sec. 20-26.9. - Awnings and overhangs. 
    Awnings that add to the character and appearance of a building when size, shape, material, color, and other features are appropriate shall be permitted for both residential and commercial structures. 
    The material most often approved has been canvas or a similar fabric in colors appropriate to the type and color of the supporting structure. 
    Signs on awnings are discussed under the section herein on signage. 
Sec. 20-26.10. - Building mass. 
    The size, shape, and scale of each structure should be compatible with adjacent structures in the neighborhood, should comply with the Zoning Regulations, and should be proportional to any other structures on the subject property. 
    Wings projecting from the central structure, bays, and offsets on building facades contribute to building mass and are also considered. 
Sec. 20-26.11. - Chimneys. 
    Chimneys are strong, architectural elements on the exterior of historic structures. They are of varying materials, often masonry, with a variety of cap treatments, including simple brick, stepping (or corbelling) of courses (rows) of brick or stone, terra cotta caps, bishop's cap (a pointed brick arch), or flat stone coping. 
    Historic chimneys constructed of old brick and the softer mortars used a century ago often need lining to prevent fire or smoke damage due to deteriorated mortar joints. This can now be done without changing the exterior of the chimney and such work has been encouraged by the Commission, with the application of preservation tax credits. 
    Work such as repointing mortar shall be done in accordance with guidelines set forth by the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Historic Preservation which dictates the use of soft mortars composed of sand, hydrated lime, small amounts of white Portland cement, and clean water. In no case should the strength of the mortar exceed the strength of the brick or stone. Repointing shall be to a depth of one-half (1/2) inch minimum and joints shall be tooled to match the original joint profile. 
    When re-pointing brick or stonework, the mortar mix should match the original in color and joint profile. 
    The application of a mortar or concrete parging (a covering used to give a smooth surface) which obscures the masonry surface and poses a threat to the hard outer shell of brick or stone masonry is discouraged. 
    The painting of brick or other natural materials, while discouraged, is not prohibited, but applicants should be aware of the difficulties in removing paint once applied. See Section 20-26.22, Painting. 
Sec. 20-26.12. - Colors. 
    The commission does not dictate what colors an applicant may use, but is concerned that the colors selected be appropriate for the structure and its neighborhood. 
    The only guideline for the application of color in either residential or commercial districts is that the colors should be historically appropriate house colors. This refers to the colors that date to an appropriate period and that go together in a compatible fashion. Samples of such color chips are on file in the Department of Community Planning and Business Services at the Laurel Municipal Center, 8103 Sandy Spring Road, Laurel, MD, 20707. 
    In commercial districts, the building and the block should be considered to achieve a compatible application of colors. 
Sec. 20-26.13. - Demolition. 
(a)  Generally. The Historic District Commission is responsible for the preservation of Laurel's historic buildings and sites. Therefore, demolition of such buildings is generally undesirable and to be avoided whenever possible. The Historic District Commission may approve an application for demolition if it will not have an adverse impact on the Historic District and/or denial of the application will result in substantial hardship to the applicant. 
    In the event a situation arises which may require consideration of the demolition of a structure, the Commission has established a three-part hearing process. 
    The second and third hearings described hereinafter shall not occur unless and until the Commission makes a finding that a structure proposed for demolition is of unusual importance in accordance with Subsection (b)(2) hereof. Nonetheless, upon the request of an applicant, the Commission may permit all, or any combination, of the hearings required pursuant to this section to be scheduled for one (1) hearing before the Historic District Commission if the Commission determines that the issues involved with regard to the subject application may reasonably be addressed by the Commission in one (1) hearing. 
(b)  Initial hearing; determination whether structure is of unusual importance. 
(1)  Notification. Two (2) weeks prior to the first hearing, the applicant will erect a zoning sign in front of or on the structure indicating that the structure has been proposed for demolition, and indicating the dates of the public hearing(s) on the matter. 
(2)  Determination whether structure is of unusual importance. The Historic District Commission shall make a determination during a regularly scheduled Commission meeting as to the contribution a structure makes to the Historic District in which it is located. This determination shall be made separate from and prior to the Commission's consideration of the financial hardship the structure may present and plans for the site should the demolition be approved. Such a decision by the Commission shall be based solely on its evaluation of the architectural and/or historical importance and character of the structure in relation to the Historic District as a whole. 
Specifically, the Historic District Commission shall make a finding whether the preservation of the structure proposed for demolition is of unusual importance to Prince George's County or the City of Laurel, or unusual importance to the State of Maryland or the nation as a whole, in accordance with Annotated Code of Maryland, Article 66B, sections 8.09 and 8.10, as amended. To make such a finding the Commission must, at minimum, find that one (1) or more of the following criteria are met with regard to the subject structure: 
Based upon evidence presented before the Historic District Commission: 
a.  The structure represent(s) one (1) or more periods or styles of architecture which has significant character, interest or value as part of the development or culture of the City, county, state, or nation; 
b.  The structure constitutes a significant or unique representation of the architectural period in which it was built and has distinguishing characteristics of style, materials or construction; 
c.  The structure contributes to the heritage of the City, county, state, or the structure provides historic or scenic value significant to the City; 
d.  County, state, or nation; or 
e.  The structure has yielded or may be likely to yield archeological information important in the history or pre-history of the City, county, state, or nation. 
(3)  If the Historic District Commission decides that a structure in the Historic District may be demolished because it is not of unusual importance in accordance with Subsection (b)(2) of this section, the applicant may proceed with obtaining a City demolition permit from the Department of Community Planning and Business Services. The applicant may be required to provide the Commission with information regarding the existing site and structure such as color photographs of the exterior, exterior measurements, and/or an existing conditions site plan. 
If the Commission determines that a structure is of unusual importance in accordance with Subsection (b)(2) of this section, and if the applicant wishes to proceed, a second hearing shall be scheduled regarding the proposed demolition. 
(c)  Second hearing; economic evaluation. 
(1)  Notification. Documentation and information for the second hearing must be submitted at least two (2) weeks before consideration. The second hearing will not be scheduled until the required documentation is received by the Department of Community Planning and Business Services. The required material shall be indicated by the Commission at the end of the initial hearing if the structure is determined to be of unusual importance in accordance with the provision of Subsection (b)(2) of this section. 
(2)  Materials which may be requested by the Commission. The Historic District Commission is sensitive to the needs of property owners and considers that substantial hardship occurs when a property cannot be put to reasonable beneficial use. In the case of a demolition application, the Commission shall consider whether a structure can be put to a reasonable beneficial use without the approval of a demolition application. In the case of income producing properties, the Commission shall also consider whether a reasonable return from the existing building can be obtained. The following information may be requested by the Commission's in conjunction with its decision making process regarding economic evaluation of a demolition application. The Commission reserves the right to present this information to consultants, as needed. Specifically, the Commission may request one (1) or more of the following items: 
a.  Form of ownership of the property; 
b.  Cost of proposed demolition and removal, and an estimate of any additional costs that would be incurred to comply with recommendations of the Commission; 
c.  A report from a licensed engineer in the State of Maryland as to the structural soundness of the building and its adaptability for rehabilitation. Any dangerous conditions should be identified; 
d.  Fair market value of the property to be presented through an appraisal by a qualified professional expert. All appraisals obtained within the previous two (2) years by the owner or the applicant in connection with the purchase, financing, or ownership of the property; 
e.  An itemized breakdown from a professional, experienced in rehabilitation as to the economic feasibility or reuse of the existing structure on the property; 
f.  If the property is income producing, the annual gross income from the property for the previous two (2) years; the itemized operating and maintenance expenses for the past two (2) years; and the depreciation deduction and annual cash flow before and after debt service, if any, during the same period; 
Price asked and offers received, if any, within the previous two (2) years. Most recent assessed value of the property and real estate taxes; 
(3)  Economic evaluation. The second hearing will serve to determine: 
a.  Whether or not denial of a demolition permit would create substantial detriment to the public welfare, i.e. the retention of the structure is not in the best interest of the community; and/or 
b.  If the denial of the demolition application will result in substantial hardship to the applicant; and/or 
c.  If the property in its present state has been declared a hazard by the City. 
At the second hearing the Commission shall consider if a structure can be put to a reasonable beneficial use without the approval of a demolition and, in the case of income producing properties, the Commission shall also consider whether a reasonable return from the existing building can be obtained. 
Substantial hardship occurs when a property cannot be put to reasonable beneficial use. It is the responsibility of the applicant to prove that demolition is necessary to avoid substantial hardship and/or to avoid substantial detriment to the public welfare. If a property has been declared a hazard or unfit for habitation by the City, the City shall present evidence of such to the Commission. 
Information submitted in the application is required to assist the Commission in its evaluation of the demolition. The Commission may request additional information from the applicant that is relevant to its determination, and may seek professional comments regarding the applicant's submission. The Commission may also make its own study of the points listed below in order to obtain additional information for its decision. The Commission reserves the right to present this information to consultants, as needed, to assist in the evaluation of the application. 
Should the applicant for demolition of a contributing structure satisfy the Commission that a substantial hardship will be suffered if a demolition application is denied, and if the demolition of the structure in question is without substantial detriment to the public welfare, a demolition application will be approved. The applicant will proceed to submit plans for new construction. The applicant must provide for the existing structure: color photographs of the exterior, an existing conditions site plan, and an interior photographical reconnaissance. 
However, if the applicant fails to demonstrate substantial hardship, the Commission shall deny the application and set or the reasons for doing so in writing. 
d.  Third hearing; consideration of replacement structure. In applications involving proposed new construction, the new design will not be considered until the building's historical importance has been determined and until the Commission has completed the economic evaluation process outlined in hearing two. 
In cases where new construction is proposed, a City demolition permit shall not be issued by the Department of Community Planning and Business Services until replacement plans are approved by the Planning Commission and the Historic District Commission and other reviewing bodies of the City of Laurel where appropriate. An exception to this may be made if conditions that eminently threaten health and safety exist in the structure. In addition, financial proof of the ability to complete the replacement structure(s), including but not limited to a performance bond, a letter of credit, a trust for completion of improvements or a letter of commitment from a financial institution must be submitted. 
Consideration of a replacement structure(s) will require at least two (2) hearings. The plans should include the materials in Section 20-26.6, Documentation, of these guidelines, and the design of the new structure(s) should conform to Section 20-26.21, New construction, of these guidelines. 
Sec. 20-26.14. - Doors and entrances. 
    The entry of a structure is a focal point and should receive special attention. Replacement doors should be compatible with the architectural style of the structure. Typical doors in Historic Districts are constructed of either wood or metal and may be paneled. A combination of panels and glass, full-light glass (especially in commercial establishments), a number of lights (panes) in a-wood or metal frames (such as the 15-light French door), flush, louvered, paired doors, sliding patio doors, storm doors, or screen doors are some suggestions. Storm or screen doors should be the same size as the main door and be compatible in appearance. 
    Often the door is part of an embellished entryway consisting of the door(s), sidelights, transoms, columns, pedimental trim, or recessed entry. However, the size of such entrances should be in keeping with the scale of the building. Their removal or replacement by simpler entryways has been discouraged. 
Sec. 20-26.15. - Driveways and parking pads. 
    The Historic District Commission reviews applications for driveways and parking pads to ensure that their installation and the materials used, is consistent with other lots in the block and with the historic nature of the neighborhood. The Commission discourages the use of gravel. 
    Parking in most of Laurel's residential Historic Districts has been to the side or rear of the structure. The relocation of parking out of front yards to a less conspicuous portion of a residential lot is desirable for the maintenance of the residential character of neighborhoods. 
Sec. 20-26.16. - Fences. 
    The construction of fences separating yards is common throughout the Historic Districts. Fence heights are limited by the Zoning Regulations and, while the Historic District Commission may authorize a fence lower than the maximum (e.g., for consistency with the fence on a neighboring property), it cannot approve fencing higher than the Zoning Regulations allows. In all cases any decision made by the Planning Commission overrides the decisions of the City of Laurel Historic District Commission. The finished side of the fence should always face outward, away from the lot, area, or structure, which it surrounds. Fences in the front yard shall be at the property, or at the building line of the front facade. 
    The use of traditional painted picket fencing in front yards is acceptable. Solid flat-board fencing of any height is not permitted in the front yard. The use of chain-link fencing is discouraged as being least compatible with the historic environment and allowed only in exceptional circumstances. 
    The installation of a fence beside an existing fence is viewed by the Commission as not in keeping with the character of the neighborhood, as well as a potential maintenance problem. The Commission will not approve such installation. 
    The Historic District Commission permits specific fence types on a case-by-case basis, the specific fencing permitted depending on surrounding properties and the architectural character of the neighborhood. 
Sec. 20-26.17. - Garages. 
    See Section 20-26.7, Accessory Structures. 
Sec. 20-26.18. - Handicap ramps. 
    The City of Laurel and federal law require handicap ramps on public buildings and on businesses when they change use, and the Commission cannot set those requirements aside. However, while recognizing the need for reasonable access, the Commission is concerned with appearance of such ramps and urges that they: 
(a)  Be placed as inconspicuously as possible (which can often be accomplished by screening with bushes or other plantings), facade; 
(b)  If possible, be placed on the side or rear of the building rather than on the front; and 
(c)  Be compatible in architectural style and color to the structure, i.e. porch style, materials, color scheme. 
    To the extent, however, that this section or any portion hereof, conflicts with federal law, federal law shall be controlling, and the conflicting portion of this section shall be deemed stricken. 
Sec. 20-26.19. - Landscaping. 
(a)  The Historic District Commission requires the submission of a detailed scaled landscape plan prior to final approval of the plans for new construction, including additions. 
(b)  Commission approval is required for major landscaping design or reconfiguration on sites that have been declared historic by inclusion as a historic site on the national or state register or declared individually a historic site by action the Mayor and City Council. 
(c)  Minor landscaping for small shrubs or flowers and routine landscaping maintenance such as mulching or pruning of trees (up to thirty-three (33) percent of the tree mass) does not require Commission approval. Removal of any dangerous or diseased landscaping or trees does not require commission approval so long as the staff and the City agree that the landscaping or tree is a hazard or diseased. Such tree or landscaping must be replaced only if required by an approved site or landscape plan. The Director of Community Planning and Business Services shall approve any requests for removal of trees or shrubs. 
Sec. 20-26.20. - Mailboxes. 
    All mailboxes shall conform to the requirements and standards of the United States Postal Service. The Commission will review only regarding color and style to ensure compatibility with other mailboxes in the neighborhood. 
Sec. 20-26.21. - New construction. 
(a)  Generally. The unique character of the City of Laurel Historic District has evolved over one hundred (100) years. By introducing new elements to the streetscapes, new construction has the potential to make immediate and lasting changes to the character of the Historic District. New construction should express its contemporary nature, while relating visually to the historic resources which surround it. Structures in the Historic District represent many architectural styles. Designs should be compatible with the existing structures. 
    The design of a new building in the Historic District must be sensitive to its environment, and should capitalize on those features which create the historic character of the district. The densely developed nature of the Historic District requires that the visual effect of new construction must be considered not only in relationship to the immediately adjacent structures, but also with regard to the broader context of the streetscape and block. Issues to be addressed in design development include rhythm, site features and landscaping, setback, spacing, height, scale, massing, facade and openings (proportion, size, detailing), materials, texture, and roof forms. 
(b)  Streetscapes. Streetscapes have characteristic patterns, which are created by the site, spacing, and proportions of buildings, the organization of facades and architectural details. In planning for new construction, these patterns, or rhythms, should be analyzed and incorporated into the design. 
(1)  Additions to structures. Contemporary additions to historic buildings require special care and sensitivity in design. The addition should respect the existing building and materials, and generally should remain distinct from the original structure and have its own design integrity. 
(2)  New additions should be planned and executed in a manner that preserves integrity of the existing building and its environment. Significant historic architectural fabric or detailing should not be removed, destroyed, or obscured by new additions. 
(3)  The size, scale and massing of the addition should be compatible with the original building and surrounding structures. Additions should be subordinate to the original building in height, scale, massing, and detail. 
(4)  Additions should be fully integrated with the existing construction, but should remain clearly distinguishable from the original building. A slight offset between the old section and the new, a subtle change in materials, or a vertical joint or trim element can accomplish this. 
(c)  Site features and landscaping. Other site features should be compatible to the surrounding streetscape in materials and design. New parking areas and garages should be located on the site in a manner that is sensitive to the surrounding properties and the general streetscape, including the possible use of landscaping or other screening features. Paving materials and design should be appropriate to the historic context. 
(d)  Setback. New construction should provide a setback that is sensitive setback of adjacent structures, and structures in the neighborhood. 
(e)  Spacing. The spatial relationships among existing buildings on a block and neighborhood suggest an appropriate width and spacing for new construction in the Historic District. 
(f)  Height. The eave or cornice lines of existing buildings on a particular street define a range of heights. New construction should remain within this range of heights in order to achieve the goal of compatibility with surrounding structures. 
(g)  Scale. The size and proportion of doors, windows, details, etc., are related to each other and to the spaces between them. New construction should be consistent in scale with surrounding buildings and their elements. 
(h)  Massing. New construction should continue the pattern of massing, if any, of adjacent and neighboring structures. 
(i)  Facade and openings (proportion, size, detailing). New facades should be compatible with historic buildings in proportion and relationships to wall area and openings. Windows and door openings should correspond to the rhythm and proportion that exist on neighboring structures. Generally, doors and windows are proportioned vertically. The total area of windows on a residential facade should be in a range of twenty-five (25) percent to forty (40) percent of the total surface area. In buildings with commercial uses on the first floor, the area of ground floor openings should be in the range of sixty-five (65) percent to seventy-five (75) percent, to correspond with traditional storefront organization. 
    Further detailed information regarding doors and entrances, and windows can be found in Section 20-26.14, Doors and entrances, and Section 20-26.24, Windows, respectively of these guidelines. 
(j)  Materials. Materials for new construction should be selected from among those that are typical of surrounding buildings, and should be compatible with existing materials in color and texture. Brick masonry and wood frame are the predominant construction methods in the Historic District. 
    Brick color, texture, and bonding pattern should be compatible with those seen in surrounding buildings. Brick veneer may provide a less expensive alternative to masonry construction. 
(k)  Siding and trim. New construction may employ a variety of wood trim and siding profiles. Siding should have a smooth finish profile that is compatible with existing buildings in the neighborhood. 
    The use of synthetic siding materials, such as aluminum or vinyl, is discouraged on the primary facade of a new building. Synthetic siding is acceptable on secondary elevations (side or rear) where the synthetic material will not be readily visible from a public way. In this application, siding must have a profile that is compatible with existing buildings in the neighborhood. 
    New construction should avoid the use of the following as wall materials or finishes: asbestos, reflective glass, unparged or unpainted concrete block, split-faced concrete masonry units, porcelain coated metal panels, permastone, formstone, and fiberglass. 
(l)  Roof form and materials. The profile of roofs against the sky is an important aspect of the character of streetscapes in the Historic District. A variety of roof styles contribute to this effect, including gable, shed, hip and flat forms. The roof on a new building should conform with the predominant form, orientation, and height of roofs on the street. The preservation and in kind replacement of metal roofs is strongly encouraged. 
    Many buildings in the Historic District have complex roofs made up of the primary form of the main roof and the secondary forms of roofs on additions, porches, entries, etc. This variety is an important, traditional characteristic which may be incorporated into the design of new buildings. 
    Some of the gable-roofed buildings in the Historic District have dormer windows. This traditional architectural element may be incorporated into a contemporary design. Dormers should remain a minor design feature and should not dominate the roof slope and elevation where they appear; they should be aligned with the facade windows or located between the openings below. The pitch of dormers should repeat that of the main roof. Shed dormers should only be used on roof slopes not visible from the street. 
    Skylights may be incorporated into new construction, but must be designed with special care as these elements can disrupt the continuity of the roofscape along the street. They should be located on secondary elevations not readily visible from the public way, and should be carefully integrated into the overall roof form. 
    For more information on roof form and materials, refer to Section 20-26.28, Roofs and roofing, of these guidelines. 
(m)  Mechanical equipment. The type and location of new heating and cooling equipment and other mechanical devices should be carefully planned in new construction, as these elements can detract from both the building and its surroundings. Rooftop mechanical unit's television and radio antenna and satellite dishes should not be visible from the public way unless permitted under current FCC Regulations. If it is not possible, they should be screened and/or painted to blend with the building. 
    If required by Zoning Regulations electrical, telephone and cable service is required to be placed underground. Permanent mechanical equipment, including but not limited to air conditioner units, fuel tanks, gauges and meters, and through-the-wall systems are discouraged on the front facade. Portable equipment, such as window units are permitted. 
    Mechanical systems should be placed on the side or rear of the structure. Screening features such as fencing and landscaping should be incorporated into the installation. 
Sec. 20-26.22. - Painting. 
    The painting of brick and certain other masonry materials is discouraged. 
    The use of sandblasting, for removal of paint from brick, may not be permitted if it will cause undue damage to historic sites or structures. Chemical treatment for paint removal is regulated by state environmental agencies. 
Sec. 20-26.23. - Patios and walkways. 
    Construction, renovation, and replacement of walkways and patios shall be reviewed by the Commission. Materials such as brick, stone, macadam, bituminous paving (blacktop), and concrete, exposed aggregate concrete and interlocking pavers are acceptable. 
Sec. 20-26.24. - Windows. 
(a)  Openings in the mass of the structure give further definition by their specific style: double-hung (single or multiple panes in each sash), casement, sliding, and specialty units (such as round, half-round, hexagonal, picture windows, or combination of types). Windows should be consistent with the style of architecture of the structure. 
(b)  The preservation of historic windows is encouraged by the Commission. To allow flexibility in achieving energy efficiency, the use of vinyl or aluminum "clad" units is permitted. 
(c)  The use of imitation muntins (separators between windowpanes) which do not resemble the original historic windows is discouraged. 
Sec. 20-26.25. - Placement of the structure on the site. 
    The placement of the structure on its site shall comply with Zoning Regulations and should be compatible with the neighborhood and block pattern. 
Sec. 20-26.26. - Porches. 
    Porches should be retained and their repair or restoration should duplicate as near as possible the original construction. New porch flooring, railings, columns, stairs, skirting, or other details should appear as near as possible the same as the original work. The use of non-traditional materials, when not intrusive (clearly visible from the public right-of-way), may be permitted. The enclosing of open porches on historic structures, especially on front and wrap-around porches is discouraged. 
    Finishes, such as the painting or staining of new materials, should match the original appearance. The use of modern pressure-treated decking to replace original tongue-and-groove flooring has been discouraged since this material does not match tongue-and-groove, even if painted. 
    Steps leading up to porches may be of wood, brick, stone, or concrete, as appropriate to the material and architecture of the main structure. The Historic District Commission recommends the replacement of existing steps in-kind. 
    Railings on porch stairs should have handrails and pickets to match the railing of the porch. 
Sec. 20-26.27. - Preservation incentives. 
(a)  Preservation tax credits are governed by Chapter 16, Section 16-2, of the Laurel City Code as amended by Ordinance Number 1265 dated July 27, 1998. Tax credit incentives are used to promote rehabilitation and preservation of the structural integrity and overall appearance of the Historic Districts. Credits may also be approved for certain activities not visible from the right-of-way. Preservation incentives and other tax credits are governed by state and local law. In the event of any conflict between these guidelines and state and local law, state and local law shall be controlling. 
(b)  An application for tax credit is part of the Historic District Commission certificate application, and the Commission determines at the time it takes action on the certificate whether the proposed work is eligible for the tax credit. Upon completion of the work, the property owner must submit the receipts to the secretary, along with the receipt transmittal form affirming that the receipts are those for the actual expenditures. Once the work has been inspected and the receipts are verified, the tax credit is submitted to the Commission for final approval. 
(c)  In cases where the property owner provides the labor, tax credits are based solely on the cost of the materials used. 
(d)  A five (5) percent tax credit shall be allowed for any restoration or preservation work, which has not been reviewed and approved in advance by the Commission, except for emergency repairs. The Commission may deny the credit in regard to any aspects of the restoration and/or preservation not done in a workmanlike manner or which has a negative effect on the architectural quality of the structure. 
(e)  As of January 1, 1998 the state income tax credit for rehabilitation of residential and income-producing properties will be increased from ten (10) percent to fifteen (15) percent. A twenty (20) percent Federal Income Tax Credit is available for the rehabilitation of income-producing properties. All rehabilitation work must be approved by the appropriate local agency before work commences and should comply, to the extent possible, with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties.

www.marylandhistoricaltrust.net. 
Sec. 20-26.28. - Roofs and roofing. 
(a)  For repairs and replacements of existing structures, or roofing of new construction, the Historic District Commission considers the following: 
(1)  Style (e.g., gambrel, gable, hip, shed, flat, authentic mansard); 
(2)  Material (e.g., standing seam metal, slate, wood shingles, asphalt or fiberglass shingles, rolled roofing, slag, hot mopped asphalt, tile); 
(3)  Details (dormers, gables, chimneys); 
(4)  Gutters and downspouts; and 
(5)  Color. 
(b)  For existing structures, the Commission recommends replacement in-kind. The color of the material should be complementary/compatible to the other colors on the structure. 
(c)  Roofs on porches, accessory structures, and building additions should match those on the main or existing structure where possible. 
Sec. 20-26.29. - Satellite dishes and other telecommunications antenna. 
    Satellite dishes and other telecommunications antennas are subject to the regulations contained in Section 20-15, Satellite earth station antennas, of the Zoning Regulations, as amended, pertaining to regulation of satellite earth station antennas and current FCC Regulations. 
Sec. 20-26.30. - Shutters. 
(a)  Preference is given to repair of existing shutters or replacement in-kind. The rules to be followed for the proper appearance of shutters or exterior blinds in Historic Districts are: 
(1)  The width should, except where not possible be sufficient for each shutter to cover one-half (1/2) of the window opening; 
(2)  The height, starting above the sill and ending below the lintel, should, except where not possible be such that the shutter appears to cover the entire window when closed; and 
(3)  The style of the shutter should be compatible with the style of the structure. 
(b)  These guidelines apply whether the shutter is operable or fixed. 
(c)  Double windows. For double windows, the width and height of each shutter should, except where not possible be sufficient to cover twenty-five (25) percent of the window and shall be consistent with the style of the structure and the historic nature of the neighborhood. 
Sec. 20-26.31. - Signage. 
    Signs and their size are controlled by Zoning Regulations. The Historic District Commission may deal with the design of such sign (but not content), its placement on the structure and the color of such sign as well as other adopted City policies concerning signage and streetscapes if applicable. 
(a)  General guidelines. 
(1)  The commercial area of the Historic District, primarily Laurel's Main Street and portions of Route 1, and their preservation is of special interest to the City. These areas include a considerable number of signs, which taken in total, affect the overall visual quality and appeal of the Historic District. 
(2)  While size, scale, and location of signs are regulated by Zoning Regulations, the Historic District Commission, in considering the overall appearance of the sign, including the general design, materials, and color, may apply stricter standards. 
(3)  The lettering on all signs may have the business name and may have a secondary message.

(b)  Restrictions and covenants should be so written that they may be amended to meet changed conditions, after approval by a majority of the front foot ownership within the portion of the subdivision affected. 
Sec. 20-29.7. - Review procedure; adequate public facilities. 
(a)  This review procedure is provided to establish a process that will enable the City to determine the adequacy of roads and other public facilities in order to achieve the goals and objectives of the duly adopted Master Plan of the City. The basis of the procedure is to require the assessment of public services and facilities and the project's consistency in regard to the City's and other Capital Improvement Plans (CIP), water and sewer plans, and other agencies having jurisdiction for the provision of public improvements. 
    Given the regional location of the City of Laurel, the Planning Commission may give consideration to any interjurisdictional effects of projects being reviewed, such as traffic impact, which can be shown by the addition of the proposed development. 
    Among the growth management plans utilized by the City, the Commission may consider the goals and objectives of the following policies, sections, and plans which are contained within the: 
(1)  Duly adopted Master Plan for the City of Laurel; 
(2)  Provisions of the City of Laurel Zoning Regulations; 
(3)  The annual Capital Improvement Program of the City of Laurel; and 
(4)  The Capital Programs and Master Plan of surrounding jurisdictions, when such facilities may be impacted in the view of the Planning Commission, or shown by the applicant's required adequate public facility analysis. 
(b)  Before preliminary approval may be granted for any subdivision plat or site development plan, or a Final Plan of Revitalization Overlay area proposal, regardless of the zoning classification of the property involved, the Planning Commission may find that sufficient public facilities and services exist or are programmed for the area. It is the intent of this section that public facilities and services should be adequate to preclude danger or injury to the health, safety and welfare and excessive expenditure of public funds unless mitigated by funding requirements for specific public facilities, or the provision of equipment, services, or other means to provide for the inadequate public facilities concluded by the fiscal analysis provided by the applicant or determined by the Planning Commission. 
(1)  The Planning Commission shall consider the potential of the proposed subdivision or site development or Final Plan for a Revitalization Overlay Area in relation to the surroundings, including the nature, extent and size of the proposed subdivision or development, the estimated increase in population, the anticipated timing of the development of the land proposed for subdivision, the degree of urbanization or development within a reasonable distance of the subject property, given the size and density of the proposed subdivision or development, and the following factors: 
a.  The availability of existing or programmed sewage or water mains. 
b.  The potential effect of the proposed subdivision on the efficient and economic operation of existing or programmed public facilities. 
c.  The distance of any necessary extension of sewage and water facilities through unsubdivided lands which are indicated for eventual development on an approved plan. 
d.  The location of the proposed subdivision in respect to the approved "Prince George's County Ten-Year Water and Sewage Plan," or in any plan which designates the timing of construction of facilities. 
e.  The availability of access roads adequate to serve traffic which would be generated by the subdivision, or the presence of a proposal for such road(s) on an adopted Master Plan and fully funded in the current Capital Improvement Program or the State Highway Administration (SHA) program. 
f.  The availability within a reasonable distance, and the adequacy of school, fire, police, utility, park and recreation services or other public services deemed necessary by the Planning Commission. 
g.  The location of the development in relationship to public transit, including rail or bus systems, and potential impact on those facilities. 
(2)  Facilities shall be deemed programmed if they are included in an adopted Capital Improvement Program, and that there is a reasonable expectation that the project will be funded for construction. The term "Capital Improvement Program" may be construed to include those Capital Improvement Programs of the City, Prince George's County, or other surrounding counties, or regional and state agencies with jurisdiction. 
(3)  Subdivisions or developments which meet the following criteria shall be deemed adequate in regard to water and sewage facilities subject to preliminary approval or status within the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (W.S.S.C.) service area by the adopted "Prince George's County Water and Sewer Plans," or subsequent amendments to such plans. 
a.  The proposed density is in accord with an adopted plan, or as approved within a Revitalization Overlay Area consistent with the regulations and intent of such areas, and 
b.  Individual water and sewer systems, if pre-existing must be capable of meeting all local, county, and state requirements regarding water pressure, requirements for sprinkler systems, and any other public safety standards and requirements. 
(c)  In addition to the requirements of Subsection 20-29.7(b) above, all applications for approval of any subdivision or site development of residential land containing five (5) acres or more, or which provide for ten (10) or more dwelling units, or commercial, office, or industrial developments which are proposed on land area which exceeds twenty-five thousand (25,000) square feet, shall be accompanied by an adequate public facilities study which shall be prepared by the applicant and reviewed by the Planning Commission staff in accordance with standards and guidelines generally accepted by local governments. The requirement of an "Adequate Public Facility Analysis" is required in all Revitalization Overlay Area proposals. An adequate public facilities study shall be prepared by qualified professionals and technicians and shall address the following: 
(1)  The traffic and transit impacts of the proposed subdivision or development; the scoping of the analysis of such impacts shall be governed by the American Public Works Association standards as utilized by the City Department of Public Works. 
(2)  The impact on police facilities, fire and rescue facilities, and other public safety facilities with emphasis on accepted standards of service delivery, including the availability of equipment and personnel to adequately service the proposed development. 
(3)  The impact on all schools, libraries and other public facilities impacted by the proposed development within a reasonable distance of the proposed subdivision or development; the identification of all related facilities the identification of all related facilities shall be contained within the technical staff report. 
(4)  Adequacy of open space and recreational facilities in relation to the proposed subdivision or development; and 
(5)  A fiscal impact analysis which shall include anticipated revenues and costs for government services, capital improvements to be provided by the developer and government agencies, staging of development, and staging of programmed facilities. 
(6)  Estimations for fiscal impact and capital contributions for public facility impacts shall be submitted to include, if applicable, the pro rata share, or estimated proportionate share of the applicant's impact, using applicable standards, on any particular service or facility. 
(d)  In-lieu of requiring an applicant to construct or pay the cost of construction of public facilities in connection with the proposed subdivision in situations in which it would not be equitable to impose the entire cost on the applicant because of the limited impact of the proposed subdivision or development on those public facilities, the Planning Commission may require the applicant to pay a fee, or other contribution to the City based on an equitable allocation or apportionment that the proposed subdivision or development proposed would have on those public facilities. The amount of any such fee shall bear a reasonable relationship to the anticipated impact of the proposed subdivision or development on public facilities. Such fees shall be paid to a fund specifically designated for public facilities, and such fund may only be used by the City for such purposes. Such fees may be in addition to the payment of impact fees as provided for by the Mayor and City Council. 
(e)  Whenever the provisions of the Forest Conservation Regulations, as set forth in Article V of this chapter, are applicable, all such applicable provisions of Article V shall be complied with in conjunction with the subdivision proceedings of this article relating to subdivisions. 
(f)  Development proposals not requiring subdivision approval must still meet the adequate public facilities requirements, as contained within Section 20-2.2, Plans, plats, and information to accompany applications for permits, of Article 1, Zoning. 
Sec. 20-29.8. - Reservation of land for public use. 
(a)  The Planning Commission shall refer all preliminary subdivision plans to its comprehensive plan or General Plan or parts thereof, adopted or proposed, or studies related thereto, to determine the need for reserving for public use any of the land included in the said preliminary subdivision plan. Reservations may be required for: highway or street rights-of-way; public building sites; parks-except park lands to be acquired under the provisions of the Act of Congress of the United States known as Public Act 284 of the 71st Congress, approved May 29, 1930 (46 Stat. 482), popularly known as the "Capper-Cramton Act," as amended by Public Law 699, 79th Congress, approved August 8, 1946, playgrounds, or other recreation area; or other public purposes. 
(b)  If a reservation appears desirable, the Planning Commission may refer the plan to the public agency concerned with acquisition for its consideration and report. The Commission may propose alternate areas for such reservation and shall allow said public agency thirty (30) days for reply. The agency's recommendation, if affirmative, shall include a map showing the boundaries and are of the parcel to be reserved and an estimate of the time (not over three (3) years) required to complete the acquisition. 
(c)  Upon receipt of an affirmative report, the Commission shall notify the property owner and, except as provided in the following subsection, shall establish such reservation, with or without modifications, concurrently with the approval of the said preliminary subdivision plan. 
(d)  If the location of the proposed reservation differs substantially from that shown on the comprehensive plan or General Plan or parts thereof previously adopted, the Commission shall hold a public hearing. Fifteen (15) days' notice of public hearing shall be advertised in a newspaper of general circulation in the City. Hearings may also be held by the Commission in other cases deemed appropriate, subject to the same conditions of notice set forth above. 
(e)  Declaration of public reservation shall be by resolution of the Commission. Notice of the same shall be carried once in a newspaper of general circulation in the City. Certified copies of the resolution shall be sent to the property owner and to the agency concerned with acquisition. 
(f)  Final subdivision plans for the property shall be in strict conformity with the preliminary plan as to public reservation. 
(g)  During the reservation period, no building or structure shall be erected upon the land so reserved. No trees, topsoil, or cover shall be removed or destroyed; no grading shall be done; no storm drainage structure shall be so built as to discharge water on the reservation; nor shall any land so reserved be put to any use whatsoever, except upon written approval of the Commission. The Commission shall post properties so reserved with an appropriate sign, warning against violation and the penalties therefore. 
(h)  The Commission shall advise taxing and assessing bodies of all public reservations, and such public reservations shall be exempt from all state, county, and local taxes during the reservation period. 
(i)  If, at the end of the reservation period, the land so reserved is not acquired for public use or if proceedings have not been initiated, the Commission shall declare the reservation void, advertising such action in a newspaper of general circulation in the City. 
(j)  The cancellation of a preliminary subdivision plan, as provided for in this article, shall not affect a reservation if, before the cancellation date, a public agency has begun proceedings for acquisition of the subject property or has provided for it in its budget for the ensuing fiscal year. Lacking such action, the reservation, too, shall be deemed cancelled but the right to re-establish the same shall be expressly reserved. 
Sec. 20-29.9. - Waivers. 
(a)  When extraordinary conditions, undue hardships, or other unforeseen conditions or circumstances result, the Planning Commission may consider a waiver of all or a portion of the fees, or specific requirements or conditions that are imposed within their analysis of adequate public facilities for a development proposal during the preliminary plan of subdivision process, or preliminary site development plan process. 
(b)  The Commission's recommendation of the need and amount of a waiver shall be made by resolution, which shall contain its analysis and reasons for its recommendation for such waiver. 
(c)  The Commission's resolution regarding such waiver shall be approved by resolution of the Mayor and City Council, after a public hearing has been held by the Mayor and City Council. 
Sec. 20-29.10. - Mandatory dedication or fee-in-lieu of open space. 
(a)  In every instance of subdivision approval for residential use (except as set forth in paragraph (b) hereof) the Planning Commission shall require every subdivider who subdivides land to dedicate to the City a portion of such land, pay a fee, or do both, as set forth in these regulations for the purpose of providing park and recreational facilities to serve future residents of such subdivisions. 
(b)  The requirements of this section shall not apply to: 
(1)  Any lot in a single-family zone which was recorded by deed prior to the adoption of this article. 
(c)  Any land to be dedicated as a requirement of this section shall be usable and reasonably adaptable for use for active park and recreation purposed and shall be so located so as to be reasonably accessible to all the residents of the subdivision. Usable within this section means no more than twenty-five (25) percent of the property can be slopes greater than five (5) percent or flood plain or wetlands. Factors used in evaluating the adequacy of the proposed park and recreation areas may include by not be limited to size and shape, topography, geology, vegetation, access, and location. Steep slopes, streams, lakes, watercourses and floodplains may be considered up to twenty-five (25) percent of the recreational land requirement. In all instances, a minimum of seventy-five (75) percent of the recreation land requirements shall be suitable for dry ground recreational use. Seventy-five (75) percent of the dry ground recreation area should not exceed five (5) percent grade. Exceptions to the preceding may be granted in cases of exceptional hardship or where the property to be dedicated has exceptional value to the City. Such decision shall be made by the Planning Commission. Where the land has been adversely affected by the developer's operation, or his lack of control over the use of the land or where it is necessary to alter or change, to make it a suitable site, by clearing, grading, drainage or a combination thereof, a construction plan must be approved by the Department of Community Planning and Business Services, the Department of Parks and Recreation, and other required agencies. Such changes or improvements are to be required on said plan to the standards of the above Departments and agencies. 
(d)  The amount of land necessary for the said purposes shall be determined by the following formula: 
FORMULA FOR MANDATORY DEDICATION 
Density Mandatory Dedication Less than 6 units per acre 1,000 square feet per unit 6-10 units per acre 13% of gross land area 11-15 units per acre 15% of gross land area 16-20 units per acre 17% of gross land area 21 or more units per acre 20% of gross land area  
(e)  Where a fee is required to be paid in lieu of land dedication, the amount of such fee shall be based upon the following formula: 
FEE FORMULA 
One thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per dwelling unit for all single-family/detached units in developments of fifty (50) single-family dwelling units or less. 
One thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) per dwelling unit for all single-family detached units in developments of greater than fifty (50) dwelling units. 
Seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) per dwelling unit for all single-family attached units in developments containing fifty (50) or less dwelling units. 
One thousand two hundred fifty dollars ($1,250.00) per dwelling unit for all single-family attached units in developments containing greater than fifty (50) attached dwelling units.

One thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per dwelling unit for all multifamily units in developments containing more than fifty (50) multifamily dwelling units. 
(f)  Credit for private open space. Where private open space for park and recreational purposes is provided in a proposed subdivision and such space is to be privately owned and maintained by the future residents of the subdivision, such areas shall be credited against the requirement of dedication for park and recreation purposes, as set forth herein or the payment of fees-in-lieu thereof, as set forth in Subsection (e) hereof, provided the Planning Commission finds it is in the public interest to do so, and that the following standards are met: 
(1)  That yards, court areas, setbacks and other areas required to be maintained by the Zoning Regulations and Building Code regulations shall not be included in the computation of such private open space; and 
(2)  That the private ownership and maintenance of the open space is adequately provided for by written agreement; and 
(3)  That the use of the private open space is restricted for park and recreational purposes by recorded covenants which run with the land in favor of the future owners of property within the tract and which cannot be defeated or eliminated without the consent of the Mayor and City Council; and 
(4)  That the proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for park and recreational purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography, geology, access, and location of the private open space land; and 
(5)  That facilities proposed for the open space are in substantial accordance with the provisions of the Recreational Element of the Master Plan, and are approved by the Planning Commission. 
(g)  Choice of land or fee. 
(1)  Procedure. The procedure for determining whether the subdivider is to dedicate land, pay a fee, or both, shall be as follows: 
a.  Subdivider. At the time of filing a preliminary plat of subdivision for approval, the owner of the property shall, as part of such filing, indicate whether he desires to dedicate property for park and recreational purposes, or whether he desires to pay a fee-in-lieu thereof. If he desires to dedicate land for this purpose, he shall designate the area thereof on the tentative tract map as submitted. 
b.  Action of City. The Planning Commission shall determine as a part of such approval, whether to require a dedication of land within the subdivision, payment of a fee-in-lieu thereof, or a combination of both. 
c.  Prerequisites for approval of final map. Where dedication is required shall be accomplished in accordance with the provisions of these subdivision regulations. Where fees are required the same shall be deposited with the City prior to the approval of the final tract map. 
Open space covenants for private park or recreational facilities shall be submitted to the City prior to approval of the final tract map and shall be recorded contemporaneously with the final tract map. 
(2)  Determination. Whether the Planning Commission accepts land dedication or elects to require payment of a fee-in-lieu thereof, or a combination of both, shall be determined by consideration of the following: 
a.  Recreational elements contained in the City's Master Plan; and 
b.  Topography, geology, access, location of land, and other physical factors in the subdivision available for dedication; and 
c.  Size and shape of the subdivision and land available for dedication. 
(3)  Monies collected in this manner shall be used by the City as designated by the Mayor and City Council to purchase and maintain open spaces and recreational spaces including new equipment or repair of existing equipment for the use and benefit of the residents of the subdivision. 
(h)  No plat of subdivision in which a fee is required shall be approved for recording by the Planning Commission until the said fee shall have been paid, or satisfactory assurance of payment shall have been provided. 
(i)  The land and fees received under these regulations shall be used only for the purpose of providing park and recreational facilities to serve the citizens of the City and the location of the land and amount of fees shall, where possible, bear a reasonable relationship to the use of the park and recreational facilities by the inhabitants of the subdivision. 
(j)  Should any subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phase of this section be declared invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the section in its entirety or any part thereof other than that so declared to be invalid. The Mayor and City Council hereby declares that it would have adopted this section and each subsection, sentence, clause or phrase thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one (1) or more such subsections, sentences, clauses or phases, be declared invalid. 
Sec. 20-29.11. - Subdivision control of floodplain areas and unsafe land. 
(a)  Floodplain. The commission shall, for the health, safety, comfort, and welfare for the present and future inhabitants of the City of Laurel, restrict, control, or prohibit the subdivision for development of any real property which lies within the fifty (50) year floodplain of any streams or drainage course. In floodplain areas not specifically delineated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the developer shall be required to furnish a floodplain study prepared by a professional engineer or other qualified person(s) as determined by the Department of Community Planning and Business Services, showing the extent of the fifty (50) year floodplain within the property to be developed and on adjoining property, both before and after any fill is placed; or at his option to substitute a one hundred (100) year floodplain area(s) delineation established by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers in a floodplain engineering study(ies). In the case of proposed subdivision property which includes such a floodplain area along a stream which is to be left open in its natural state, then, unless such area is to become a public park or recreation area, maintained by a designated, responsible public authority, the area shall be denoted upon the subdivision plat submitted for approval as a floodplain easement across the lots in such portion of the proposed subdivision, and properly described and recorded among the Prince George's County land records. The plat shall denote that the floodplain easement area may be used if necessary for utility lines and/or storm drainage facilities, but restricted from any use which would interfere with the purpose(s) of such easement to preserve the floodplain area(s) from encroachment by any structure(s), but excepting any open-type fencing which will not obstruct the floodway or stream. Any lot or area containing such a floodplain easement shall contain an equivalent area of land outside the easement area as otherwise required by the zoning in such location. 
(b)  Unsafe land. The Planning Commission shall also restrict, or prohibit the subdivision of any real estate found by the Commission to be unsafe for development. The restriction or prohibition may be due to natural conditions, such as, but not confined to flooding, erosive stream action, unstable soil conditions, or manmade conditions such as, but not confined to unstable fills or slopes. With respect to unsafe land (not within a floodplain as set forth in the preceding section), the Commission may permit it to be platted as part of a lot in which there is sufficient ground to erect a building or dwelling within the required setback of the zoning classification, plus an additional twenty-five (25) feet setback requirement between the structure and the unsafe area which shall be indicated on the plat as approved by a building restriction line. When any unsafe land has by subsequent change in condition become safe for building construction by appropriate findings of the Commission, the building restriction line may be removed by the authorized recording of a new plat as approved by the Commission. 
(c)  One hundred (100) year floodplains. For the purpose of this section the following definitions shall apply: 
    One hundred (100) year floodplain. That area which would be inundated by floodwater from a storm event expected to occur on the average of once within a one hundred (100) year period. The one hundred (100) year floodplain shall be determined to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission taking into consideration among other criteria (1) the existing hydraulic system of the drainage basin and (2) the future land use based on full development as indicated in the Master Plan. 
    The Commission shall, for the health, safety, comfort, and welfare of present and future inhabitants of the City, restrict, control, or prohibit the construction upon or subdivision of land lying within the one hundred (100) year floodplain of any river, stream, or drainage course. In floodplain areas not specifically delineated by the Federal Insurance Administration's Flood Hazard Boundary Maps, a U. S. Corps of Engineers study delineating such one hundred (100) year floodplain areas may be used or if such study is not available, the developer or subdivider shall be required to furnish a floodplain study prepared by a professional engineer, showing the extent of the one hundred (100) year floodplain within the property to be developed or subdivided and on adjoining property, both before and after any fill is placed. 
    The Planning Commission shall also take reasonable measures to consider and utilize any one hundred (100) year flood evaluation data available from a federal, state, or other source as criteria for administering the standards of this section within the identified floodplain areas having special flood hazards and within any areas not identified as floodplain areas having special flood hazards, and shall in rivering situations coordinate with upstream, downstream, or adjacent communities adversely affected by development, fill, encroachment, or alteration or relocation of a watercourse. 
    At the time of building permit review of new construction or substantial improvements on land located within the identified floodplain areas having special flood hazards, the Planning Commission shall require the developer and/or subdivider to provide information concerning the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of the structure and where the lowest floor is below grade on one (1) or more sides, the elevation of the floor immediately above and shall maintain a record of all such information. 
    All building permit applications for new construction or substantial improvements within one hundred (100) year floodplain areas shall be reviewed to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a location that has been determined to have a flood hazard, any proposed new construction or substantial improvement (including prefabrication and mobile homes) must (1) be designed (or modified) and anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure, (2) use construction materials and utility equipment that are resistant to flood damage, and (3) use construction methods and practices that will minimize flood damage. 
    All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments shall be reviewed to assure that (1) all such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage, (2) all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage, and (3) adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood hazards. New or replacement water supply systems and/or sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters, and on site waste disposal systems shall be located so as to avoid impairment of them or contamination from them during flooding. 
    Should any section, subsection, clause, or phrase of this enactment be declared invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the enactment in its entirety or of any part thereof other than that so declared to be invalid. 
DIVISION 2. - PROCEDURE 

Sec. 20-30.1. - Pre-application. 
(a)  Prior to the filing of an application for conditional approval of the preliminary plan (preliminary subdivision plan, general subdivision plan), the subdivider shall submit to the Planning Commission plans and data as specified in Division 2, of this article. This step does not require formal application, fee, or filing of plat with the Planning Commission. 
(b)  Within forty (40) days the Planning Commission shall inform the subdivider that the plans and data as submitted or as modified, do or do not meet the objectives of these regulations. When the Planning Commission finds the plan and data do not meet the objectives of these regulations it shall express its reasons therefore. 
Sec. 20-30.2. - Conditional approval of preliminary plan. 
(a)  On reaching conclusions, informally as recommended in Section 20-30.1 regarding his general program and objectives, the subdivider shall cause to be prepared a preliminary plan, together with improvement plans and other supplementary material such as street profiles as specified by the Planning Commission or as required elsewhere in this article. 
(b)  Twelve (12) copies of the preliminary plan and supplementary material specified be submitted to the Planning Commission with written application for conditional approval at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered.

(7)  The validity of a preliminary plat consisting of more than four hundred (400) residentially zone lots or more than one hundred fifty (150) gross acres of commercially or industrially-zoned land or land designated for nonresidential uses in any M-X-T Zone which has a staging plan shall not be extended more than two (2) years from the normal expiration of the approved preliminary plat. 
a.  An extension of up to two (2) years from the expiration of an approved preliminary plat may be granted by the Commission provided: 
i.  Public infrastructure, which was determined to be the developer's responsibility in accordance with the requirements of Division 4, Required Improvements, of this article has been constructed by the developer in order to accommodate all stages of the development; or 
ii.  The developer has been proceeding in a diligent manner to comply with the staging plan and has been unable, through no fault of the developer, to complete development within the time frame specified; or 
iii.  The staging plan cannot be met as a result of government failure to extend necessary services or infrastructure. 
(8)  The validity of a Planned Unit Development approved in accordance with this article and Article 1, Zoning, Section 20-10, Planned Unit Development-Existing, shall not be extended more than two (2) years from the normal expiration of the approved preliminary planned unit development subdivision. 
a.  An extension of up to two (2) years from the expiration of an approved preliminary planned unit development subdivision may be granted upon the applicant's submission to the Planning Commission of a letter from a permitting agency (including, but not limited to the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, Maryland Department of Water Resources Administration, Prince George's County Department of Environmental Resources) indicating; 
i.  The date of application for the required permit;

Sec. 20-30.3. - Approval of final plat. 
(a)  The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary plan as approved, and, if desired by the subdivider, it may constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary plat which he proposes to record and develop at that time; provided, that such portion conforms to all requirements of these regulations. 
(b)  Application for approval of the final plat shall be submitted in writing to the Planning Commission at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered. 
(c)  Twelve (12) copies of the final plat and other exhibits required for approval shall be prepared as specified in Division 2 of this article and shall be submitted to the Planning Commission within twelve (12) months from the original date of the approval of the preliminary plat; otherwise, such approval shall become null and void unless an extension of time is applied for and granted by the Planning Commission pursuant to the provisions of Subsection 20-30.2(h) above. 
(d)  In the case of new subdivisions, the street profile plans shall be required before approval is given to the final subdivision plat. 
(e)  The final subdivision plat and street profiles will be approved by the Commission if found by it to be in conformity with the requirements of law and of these regulations. Approval of the final subdivision plat and street profiles shall be by resolution of the Commission and signatures of the duly authorized officers inscribed thereon. 
(f)  The final plat(s) shall be signed and sealed by the surveyor and recorded among the Land Records of Prince George's County, Maryland, within one hundred eighty (180) days of the Planning Commission's approval.

Sec. 20-30.4. - Fees. 
    The Mayor shall set the fees for activities and services performed by the Department of Community Planning and Business Services and Public Works Department in carrying out their responsibilities under this article. Fees shall be subject to review and revision periodically as experience dictates to insure that the fees are equitable and in line with the costs of administration. 
Sec. 20-30.5. - Filing of plats with Clerk of Circuit Court. 
    Whenever any person actually subdivides, develops or promotes any tract of land within the City into lots of five (5) acres or less, such person shall file a plat thereof with the clerk of the Circuit Court for Prince George's County. 
Sec. 20-30.6. - Small subdivisions. 
    When the owners of two (2) adjoining properties desire to sell or exchange parcels of land between themselves for the purpose of making minor adjustments in boundaries, they may file with the Commission a preapplication and a final subdivision plat, only provided that: 
(a)  The change of boundaries does not create record lots which violate any provisions of the Zoning Regulations or Subdivision Regulations of the City. 
(b)  No additional undeveloped or unimproved lots are thereby created. 
(c)  The subdivider shall provide the Planning Commission with satisfactory evidence of compliance with Subsections (a) and (b) above. 
DIVISION 3. - DESIGN STANDARDS 

Sec. 20-31.1. - Streets. 
(a)  The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location of all streets shall conform to the comprehensive plan and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets. All streets, roads, alleys, access roads, and service roads, shall be constructed in accordance with Article VI, Roads and Sidewalks, of this chapter, pursuant to the provisions therein relating to roads, or relating to alleys, access roads, and service roads, as the case may be, and in accordance with the Design and Construction Standards referenced in that article. When used in this article, the term "street" shall be deemed to mean "road" as defined in Article VI, Roads and Sidewalks, of this chapter. 
(b)  Where such is not shown in the comprehensive plan, the arrangement of streets in a subdivision shall either: 
(1)  Provide for the continuation or appropriate projection of existing principal streets in surrounding areas; or 
(2)  Conform to a plan for the neighborhood approved or adopted by the Planning Commission to meet a particular situation where topographical or other conditions make continuance or conformance to existing streets impracticable. 
(c)  Minor streets shall be so laid out that speeding will be discouraged. Potential methods include narrowing streets, traffic calming, bulb-outs, and sharp intersection corner radii. 
(d)  Where a subdivision abuts or contains existing or proposed arterial streets, the Planning Commission may require marginal access streets, reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a non-access reservation along the rear property line, deep lots with rear service alleys, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and local traffic. 
(e)  Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way, the Planning Commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as for parking purposes in residential zones, or for commercial or industrial purposes in appropriate zones. Such distances shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations. 
(f)  Reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be prohibited except where their control is definitely placed in the City under conditions approved by the Planning Commission. 
(g)  Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet shall be avoided.

Street Type Maximum Grade Percent Arterial  8% Collector 10% Minor 10% Marginal access 10% Alleys 10%  
(r)  No street grade shall be less than one (1) percent nor more than ten (10) percent except under unusual conditions. 
(s)  Roads shall be constructed in accordance with the provisions of Article VI, Roads and Sidewalks, of this chapter and the Design and Construction Standards referenced therein. The ultimate development of the roadway shall have a minimum width of thirty (30) feet from face of curb to face of curb, or such other width as may be permitted by the Planning Commission in accordance with the Zoning Regulations, these Subdivision Regulations, and other applicable law. 
Sec. 20-31.2. - Alleys, access roads, service roads. 
(a)  Alleys shall be provided in Commercial and Industrial Zones, except that the Planning Commission may waive this requirement where other definite and assured provision is made for service access, such as off-street loading, unloading, and parking consistent with and adequate for the uses proposed. 
(b)  Each alley, service road, and access road shall be constructed in accordance with the provisions of Article VI, Roads and Sidewalks, of this chapter and the design and construction standards referenced therein. The ultimate development of the roadway, each alley, access road, and service road shall have a minimum width of twenty (20) feet from face of curb to face of curb or such other width as may be permitted by the Planning Commission in accordance with the Zoning Regulations, these Subdivision Regulations, and other applicable law. 
(c)  Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided, but where necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently to permit safe vehicular movement. 
(d)  Dead-end alleys shall be avoided where possible, but if unavoidable, shall be provided with adequate turn-around facilities at the dead end, as determined by the Planning Commission. 
Sec. 20-31.3. - Easements. 
(a)  Easements across lots or centered on rear or side lot lines shall be provided for utilities where necessary and shall be at least fifteen (15) feet wide or as required by the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (W.S.S.C.) or other applicable public utility. All utility installations shall comply with Section 20-44.15, Location of Utilities. 
(b)  Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way, channel, or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially with the lines of such watercourse, and such further width or construction, or both, as will be adequate for the purpose. 
Sec. 20-31.4. - Building restriction lines and required parking areas. 
(a)  Building restriction lines and required parking areas shall be established for properties on proposed arterials in areas not covered by adopted area Master Plan in conformance with the standards below. Measurements shall be from the existing or proposed center line of right-of-way in each instance. Required parking area for parcels subdivided expressly for single-family detached residential purposes shall be excepted from this requirement. 
(1)  Eighty-five (85) feet if zoned single-family residential use, 
(2)  Ninety (90) feet if zoned for multifamily residential use, or 
(3)  Sixty (60) feet if zoned for commercial, industrial, or public use. 
Sec. 20-31.5. - Blocks. 
(a)  The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to: 
(1)  Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated. 
(2)  Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions. 
(3)  Needs for convenient access, circulation, control, and safety of street traffic. 
(4)  Limitations and opportunities of topography. 
(b)  Block lengths shall not exceed five hundred (500) feet. 
(c)  Pedestrian crosswalks, not less than ten (10) feet wide, shall be required where deemed essential to provide circulation, or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation, and other community facilities. 
Sec. 20-31.6. - Lots. 
(a)  The lot size, width, depth, shape, and orientation, and the minimum building setback lines shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision for the type of development and use contemplated. 
(b)  Lot dimensions shall conform to the requirements of the Zoning Regulations, and depth and width of properties reserved or laid out for commercial and industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street service and parking facilities required by the type of use and development contemplated. 
(c)  Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width to permit the appropriate building setback from and orientation to both streets. 
(d)  The subdividing of the land shall be such as to provide, by means of a public street, each lot with satisfactory access to an existing public street. 
(e)  Double frontage, and reverse frontage lots, should be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development for traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantage of topography and orientation. A planting screen easement of at least ten (10) feet, and across which there shall be no right of access, shall be provided along the line of lots abutting such a traffic artery or other disadvantageous use. 
(f)  Side lot lines shall be substantially at right angles or radial to street lines. 
(g)  In case a parcel is subdivided into larger tracts than for normal building lots, such parcel shall be divided so as to allow for the opening of major streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent minor streets. 
(h)  Each block shall be planned to provide for two (2) rows of lots, except that residential lots adjacent to freeways or other high capacity roads shall be designed to front on either an interior street or a service road. Residential lots adjacent to freeways or arterials shall be platted with a depth of not less than two hundred (200) feet, and the subdivision design shall provide for adequate protection and screening from highway nuisances. If a service road is used, it shall connect with a local interior collector street with the point of intersection located at least two hundred (200) feet away from the freeway or arterials. 
(i)  Flag lots are generally unacceptable solutions to the subdivision of land within the City of Laurel. In extraordinary situations, due to exceptional conditions such as unusual topographical conditions, or conditions which relate to pre-existing situations such as lots of record, the Board of Appeals, after receiving a recommendation from the Planning Commission, may consider such cases to constitute a hardship situation upon finding that, at a minimum, the following: 
(1)  That any extraordinary conditions that exist on the property would present practical difficulties and would deny any reasonable use of the property. 
(2)  That any proposed flag lot is the minimum reasonably necessary to overcome the situation in order to provide access to a public right-of-way, as stated in subsection (d) of this section. 
(3)  That the situation or any extraordinary condition is unique to the subject property or parcel, and any resulting deviation constitutes no precedent for any other parcels or conditions of property located elsewhere in the City. 
(4)  The proposed creation of one (1) or more flag lots for the purpose of increasing the number of lots in a parcel of property shall not constitute a hardship. 
(5)  If the Board of Appeals finds that a hardship exists pursuant to the criteria set forth herein, the Board of Appeals shall determine a minimum lot width which it feels is sufficient and compatible with adjacent lots, with provisions for buffering the drive area, and shall approve the creation of the flag lot. 
Sec. 20-31.7. - Underground utilities in residential, commercial, and industrial zones. 
(a)  New residential development, five (5) or more units. Extensions of electric distribution lines necessary to furnish permanent electric service and extensions of telephone distribution lines necessary to furnish permanent telephone service to residential buildings within a subdivision having five (5) or more building lots, or to new multiple-occupancy buildings shall be made underground by the utility. 
(b)  New residential development, less than five (5) units. Extensions of the aforementioned utilities not covered by Subsection (a) of this section shall be made underground by the utility, subject to review and decision by the Planning Commission. 
(c)  New commercial and industrial development. Electric distribution lines and telephone distribution lines necessary to furnish electric service and telephone service to new commercial and industrial buildings, shall be made underground except for extensions of electric distribution lines of nominal thirty-three thousand (33,000) volts and higher. The application of this subsection shall not be made mandatory for extensions of lines to provide electric and telephone service to customers whose premises are so un-esthetic that the construction of underground lines would serve no purpose. Customers of this nature might include gravel pits and other mining operations, junk yards, railroad yards, and steel mills. 
(d)  Special conditions. In unusual circumstances, when the application of this section appears impracticable, unjust, or discriminatory, the Planning Commission shall refer the matter to the Mayor and City Council for special ruling or for the approval of special conditions which may be mutually agreed upon, prior to commencing construction. 
(e)  All utility installations shall comply with Section 20-44.15, Location of Utilities.

(d)  For any private collective sewage disposal system, the developer shall secure the necessary permit for installation and operation from the City, the State Health Department, and the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (W.S.S.C.) and shall present satisfactory bond to guarantee construction and operation of such system. 
(e)  In areas where the Planning Commission finds it is not feasible or necessary to require collective sewer service, the lots in a proposed subdivision shall be designed for individual septic systems, provided, that the County Health Department approves the use of such a system for each lot after field testing. 
Sec. 20-32.5. - Monuments. 
    Permanent reference monuments shall be placed as required by the City Engineer. The monuments shall be of such material, size, and length as may be approved by the City Engineer.

(f)  Street profiles, grade establishment. 
(1)  Wherever street profiles are required by the Planning Commission in connection with the filing of a subdivision plat, a preliminary study of street grades shall be filed with the Planning Commission when the preliminary plan for the same area is presented for approval. The preliminary street profiles shall show existing center line and property line grades and proposed center line grade, grade percent, location and length of vertical curves, and elevations of street intersection. All elevations shall be based on W.S.S.D. datum. 
(2)  Upon tentative approval of the preliminary street profiles by the City Engineer, with or without amendment, the final street profiles shall be prepared. The final street profiles shall be drawn with black ink with the exception of the proposed center line grade and notation thereon which must be in pencil. 
(3)  In case the penciled grades are unsatisfactory to the City Engineer, the street profiles will be returned to the subdivider or his Engineer to make any changes required and ink the pencil lines and notations. 
Note: The establishment of street grades is an important and inseparable part of every subdivision development project. It is most important that a study of grades, surface drainage, and quantity and disposal of earth excavation be made at the time the subdivision design is being formulated. In case steep street grades, imperfect drainage, or excessive excavation are shown by the street profiles it would indicate that a revision should be made of the street layout. The street grade should be established before the street is graded or paved, sidewalks built or water, sewer or gas mains laid. As the pavement elevation has an important bearing on floor grades and private drives entrances, it is also important that the street grade be established in advance of any building construction. 
The final street profile plans should conform as to size, form, and information with specimen plans on display in the office of the Planning Commission. 
(g)  Building permits. No building permit shall be issued for the construction of a dwelling or other structure unless such structure is to be located on a lot or parcel of land having direct frontage on a dedicated public street or a private street or private right-of-way or easement approved by the Planning Commission. 
(h)  Street improvements. No final grading, sidewalk or pavement construction, or installation of utilities shall be permitted in the bed of any proposed street in any subdivision until the street grade has been officially established and the plat of it approved by the Planning Commission in final form and placed on record. 
(i)  Protection covenants in form for recording. 
(j)  The applicant shall post a bond for any public facilities required to be provided by the applicant with the City or responsible public agency. Such facilities may include, inter alia, the grading and improvement of roads, the construction of curbs, gutters and sidewalks, the installation of piping and connections for water, sewerage, and other utility mains, and the planting and conservation of trees. No final plat shall be approved until the applicant has submitted satisfactory written evidence to the Commission that such bond has been posted with the proper agency or authority.

DIVISION 1. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 

Sec. 20-36.1. - Findings. 
    The Federal Emergency Management Agency has identified special flood hazard areas within the boundaries of the City of Laurel. Special flood hazard areas are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. Structures that are inadequately elevated, improperly flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damage also contribute to flood losses. 
    The Mayor and City Council of the City of Laurel, by resolution dated August 9, 1971, agreed to meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program and was accepted for participation in the program on November 1, 1978. As of that date or as of November 1, 1978, the initial effective date of the City of Laurel Flood Insurance Rate Map, all development and new construction as defined herein, are to be compliant with these regulations. 
(Ord. No. 1868, 4-25-2016) 
Sec. 20-36.2. - Statutory authorization. 
    The Maryland General Assembly, in Maryland Code Annotated, Land Use Article, Title 4, has established as policy of the State that the orderly development and use of land and structures requires comprehensive regulation through the implementation of planning and zoning control, and that planning and zoning controls shall be implemented by local government in order to, among other purposes, secure the public safety, promote health and general welfare, and promote the conservation of natural resources. Therefore, the Mayor and City Council of the City of Laurel does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations.

(f)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(g)  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(h)  Minimize damage to public facilities and other utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges; 
(i)  Reinforce that those who build in and occupy special flood hazard areas should assume responsibility for their actions; 
(j)  Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and near floodprone areas; 
(k)  Provide that the flood storage and conveyance functions of floodplains are maintained; 
(l)  Minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of floodplains; 
(m)  Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally incompatible; and 
(n)  Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at 44 CFR Section 59.22. 
(Ord. No. 1868, 4-25-2016) 
Sec. 20-36.4. - Areas to which these regulations apply. 
    These regulations shall apply to all special flood hazard areas within the jurisdiction of the City of Laurel, and identified in Section 20-36.5. 
(Ord. No. 1686, 4-25-2016) 
Sec. 20-36.5. - Basis for establishing special flood hazard areas and BFEs. 
(a)  For the purposes of these regulations, the minimum basis for establishing special flood hazard areas and base flood elevations is the Flood Insurance Study for Prince George's County, Maryland and Incorporated Areas dated September 16, 2016, or the most recent revision thereof, and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Map(s) ("FIRM") and all subsequent amendments and revisions to the FIRMs. The Flood Insurance Study ("FIS") and FIRMs are retained on file and available to the public at the Department of Economic and Community Development. 
(b)  Where field surveyed topography or digital topography indicates that ground elevations are below the closest applicable base flood elevation, even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard on the FIRM, the area shall be considered as a special flood hazard area. 
(c)  To establish base flood elevations in special flood hazard areas that do not have such elevations shown on the FIRM, the Floodplain Manager may provide the best available data for base flood elevations, or may require the applicant to obtain available information from Federal, State or other sources. 
(Ord. No. 1868, 4-25-2016; Ord. No. 1910, 4-24-2017) 
Sec. 20-36.6. - Abrogation and greater restrictions.

Sec. 20-36.8. - Warning and disclaimer of liability. 
    The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur, and flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside of the special flood hazard areas or uses that are permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. 
    These regulations shall not create liability on the part of the City of Laurel, any elected official or employee of the City, the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) or the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), for any flood damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 1868, 4-25-2016; Ord. No. 1910, 4-24-2017)

(a)  Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA): An amendment based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property or structure is not located in a special flood hazard area. 
(b)  Letter of Map Revision (LOMR): A revision based on technical data that may show changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. A Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill (LOMR-F) is a determination that a structure or parcel of land has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation and is, therefore, no longer exposed to flooding associated with the base flood. In order to qualify for this determination, the fill must have been permitted and placed in accordance with the community's floodplain management regulations. 
(c)  Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and comment as to whether a proposed flood protection project or other project complies with the minimum NFIP requirements for such pro jects with respect to delineation of special flood hazard areas. A Conditional Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill (CLOMR-F) is a determination that a parcel of land or proposed structure that will be elevated by fill would not be inundated by the base flood if fill is placed on the parcel as proposed or the structure is built as proposed. A CLOMR does not revise the effective Flood Insurance Rate Map or Flood Insurance Study; upon submission and approval of certified as-built documentation, a Letter of Map Revision may be issued by FEMA, to revise the effective FIRM.

(a)  Any project for improvement of a building or structure to correct existing violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the Chief Building Official (CBO) prior to submission of an application for a permit and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(b)  Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. (Note: See "Substantial Improvement/Substantial Damage Desk Reference" [FEMA P-758]). 
    Temporary Structure. A structure installed, used, or erected for a period of less than one hundred eighty (180) days. 
    Variance. A grant of relief from the strict application of one (1) or more requirements of these regulations. 
    Violation. Any construction or development in a special flood hazard area that is being performed without an issued permit. The failure of a building, structure, or other development for which a permit is issued to be fully compliant with these regulations and the conditions of the issued permit. A building, structure, or other development without the required design certifications, the Elevation Certificate, or other evidence of compliance required is presumed to be a violation until such time as the required documentation is provided.

(a)  It shall be unlawful for any person to begin any development or construction which is wholly within, partially within, or in contact with any flood hazard area established in Section 20-36.5., including, but not limited to: filling; grading; construction of new structures; the substantial improvement of buildings or structures, including repair of substantial damage; placement or replacement of manufactured homes, including substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage of manufactured homes; erecting or installing a temporary structure, or alteration of a watercourse, until a permit is obtained from the City of Laurel. No such permit shall be issued until the requirements of these regulations have been met. 
(b)  In addition to the permits required in paragraph (a), applicants for permits in nontidal waters of the State are advised to contact MDE. Unless waived by MDE, pursuant to Code of Maryland Regulations 26.17.04, Construction on Nontidal Waters and Floodplains, MDE regulates the "100-year frequency Floodplain of free-flowing waters, " also referred to as nontidal waters of the State. To determine the 100-year frequency floodplain, hydrologic calculations are based on the ultimate development of the watershed, assuming existing zoning. The resulting flood hazard areas delineated using the results of such calculations may be different from the special flood hazard areas established in Section 20-36.5. of these regulations. A permit from the City of Laurel is still required in addition to any State requirements. 
(c)  A permit is valid provided the actual start of work is within one hundred eighty (180) days of the date of permit issuance. Requests for extensions shall be submitted in writing and justifiable cause demonstrated.

3.  Upon a decision to collect the bonds, the Director shall evaluate the work remaining to be done, determine whether the work covered by the permit should be completed, the work site should be restored to its original condition, or other modifications to the permitted work site should be made. The Director shall then determine whether the bonds posted are sufficient to carry out the required completion, restoration, or modified work. 
4.  After evaluating the work to be performed as specified above, the Director shall develop an estimate of the costs for said work, to include an amount equal to twenty-five (25) percent of the anticipated construction cost as a contingency, and compare the estimated amount to the amount of bond posted by the permittee. If the amount of bond posted is in excess of the estimate, the Department shall immediately move to collect the bonds and carry out the necessary work.

(1)  The permittee, including public utilities, agents, contractors and subcontractors, shall comply with all requirements of the permit including sediment and erosion control, either before or during the course of construction. 
(2)  Where the permittee fails to comply with the requirements cited in the notice of violation, said noncompliance may result in the following: 
a.  Issuance of a stop work order. A stop work order shall be issued by the Director and constitute a suspension of the applicable permit and shall prohibit the violator from doing any further work under the permit except such work as shall bring any previous work into compliance. When the permittee corrects the work to the satisfaction of the Department in accordance with the applicable requirements, the Director shall rescind the stop work order in writing at which time their permittee may resume further work under the permit; or 
b.  The City may complete the required work and charge the permittee on a cost basis, including the costs of administration and overhead. 
(3)  Any governmental agency not required to obtain a permit from the Department or post a bond shall be subject to the provisions of Subsections (d)(1) and (d)(2) above. In addition, nonpayment by any governmental agency of any outstanding balance due to the City within the time allotted shall subject said governmental agency to liability in the amount of nonpayment except where state or federal law provides to the contrary. 
(e)  Safety hazards; work in noncompliance. Safety hazards or work which is determined not to be in compliance with the provisions of this article, which occur within the right-or-way as a result of the work performed by the permittee and the resolution of which is considered urgent by the Department, shall be resolved by contacting the person whose name appears on the sign required under Subsection 20-44.2(k). If that person cannot be contacted, the inability of the Department to contact the permittee at the twenty-four (24) hour telephone number shall constitute notice and the Department shall be authorized to proceed with the necessary corrective action and bill the permittee accordingly for all costs incurred in accordance with Section 20-42.9. Failure of the permittee to pay the amount billed within thirty (30) days shall be sufficient grounds for suspension or revocation of the permit. 
(f)  Inspection by others. Subject to prior written arrangement, the Director may accept a report of inspection by an approved agency for work performed under permits issued by the Department. All reports of such inspections shall be in writing and certified by a responsible officer of such approved agency. The Director shall develop criteria for the approval of individual agencies for the purpose of performing inspections and promulgate policy and procedures for the conducting of such inspections. 
Sec. 20-43.13. - Approval and acceptance of work. 
(a)  Final approval of construction work shall be given by the Director of Public Works upon verification through inspection that the work conforms in all respects with the permit and includes all work required thereby. For acceptance of new roads the Public Works Department Inspector must verify that all utilities were installed properly. Failure to comply will prevent the Director from accepting new roads. Notification by the Director that all work under the permit has been approved and accepted by the City shall serve as formal notice to the permittee and the bonding institution that all requirements of the permit have been satisfied. 
(b)  Partial acceptance. A permittee may request a final approval of part of the work covered by the permit provided that the limits of work requested for partial acceptance are completed in accordance with this chapter.

(6)  No permit shall be issued or effective unless it is shown that the wireless telecommunications facility will comply with Federal Communication Commission ("FCC") regulations governing radio frequency ("RF") emissions. Every wireless facility shall at all times comply with applicable FCC regulations governing RF emissions, and failure to comply shall be a treated as a material violation of the terms of any permit or lease. 
(7)  No towers shall be permitted in the public rights-of-way, and no wireless telecommunications facilities shall be permitted above-ground in underground areas; provided that the City may permit placements where all elements of the wireless telecommunications facility are concealed and the facility does not appear to a casual observer to be a wireless telecommunications facility. 
(8)  No permit shall be issued except to wireless service providers with immediate plans for use of the proposed wireless telecommunications facility; or wireless infrastructure providers with contracts with wireless service providers which require the service provider immediately to use the proposed wireless telecommunications facility. 
(9)  Unless appropriately placed, concealed, and designed so that the size of the facility cannot be increased except with the discretionary approval of the City, no wireless telecommunications facility is permitted in rights-of-way in Historical Districts, or alleys. 
(Ord. No. 1932, § 6, 9-24-2018; Ord. No. 1933, § 6, 11-26-2018)  
Sec. 20-60.7. - Application submission requirements. 
(a)  Submission. Unless the wireless regulations provide applicant shall submit, a paper copy and an electronic copy of any application, amendments or supplements to an application, or responses to requests for information regarding an application to: City Administrator, Laurel Municipal Center, 8103 Sandy Spring Road, Laurel MD 20707. If forms are prescribed by the City, applications for a permit for a wireless telecommunications facility, and any other permit required in connection with that facility, must be submitted on these forms. 
(b)  Content. An application must contain: 
(1)  Any information required pursuant to the wireless regulations; 
(2)  The name of the applicant, its telephone number and contact information, and if the applicant is a wireless infrastructure provider, the name and contact information for the wireless service provider that will be using the wireless telecommunications facility; 
(3)  A complete description of the proposed wireless telecommunications facility and the work that will be required to install or modify it (including, but not limited to, detail regarding proposed excavations, if any; detailed site plans showing the location of the wireless telecommunications facility, and specifications for each element of the wireless telecommunications facility, clearly describing the site and all structures and facilities at the site before and after installation or modification; and describing the distance to the nearest residential dwelling unit and any historical structure within five hundred (500) feet of the facility. Before and after 360-degree photo simulations must be provided. The electronic version of an application must be in a standard format that can be easily uploaded on a web page for review by the public. 
(4)  If the application is an eligible facilities request, within the meaning of 47 C.F.R. Section 1.40001, the application must contain information sufficient to show that the application qualifies as an eligible facilities request, which information must include all the information required by Section 20-60.7(b)(1)—(3), and must include the permit that was granted for the existing facility; show compliance with all conditions associated with that permit; and identify all changes to the facility from the date of the issuance of the permit. 
(5)  If applicant contends that denial of the application would prohibit or effectively prohibit the provision of personal wireless services, or otherwise violate applicable laws or regulations, under circumstances such that deployment of the facilities must be authorized, the application must provide all information on which the applicant relies in support of that claim. Applicants are not permitted to supplement this showing if doing so would prevent City from complying with any deadline for action on an application. 
(6)  Proof that notice has been mailed to owners of all property, and the resident manager for any multifamily dwelling unit that includes ten (10) or more units, within three hundred (300) feet of the proposed wireless telecommunications facility. 
(7)  Any required fees. 
(8)  To the extent that filing of the wireless application establishes a deadline for action on any other permit that may be required in connection with the wireless facility, the application shall include complete copies of applications for every required permit, including, without limitation, electrical permits, building permits, traffic control permits, and excavation permits, with all engineering completed, and with all fees associated with each permit included with the application. 
(c)  Fees. For wireless telecommunications facilities, applicant must provide an initial deposit and agree as part of its application to pay all costs reasonably incurred by city in reviewing the application, including costs incurred in retaining outside consultants. Fees shall be reviewed periodically, and raised or lowered based on costs the City expects to incur, with a review commencing by the first anniversary of the effective date of this ordinance. 
(d)  Waivers. Requests for waivers from any requirement of this section shall be made in writing to the City Administrator. The same may grant a request for waiver if it is demonstrated that, notwithstanding the issuance of a waiver, the City will be provided all information necessary to understand the nature of the construction or other activity to be conducted pursuant to the permit sought. 
(e)  Rejection for incompleteness. For personal wireless facilities, as that term is defined under federal law, and eligible facilities requests, as that term is defined under federal law, applications will be processed, and notices of incompleteness provided, in conformity with state, and local and federal law. If such an application is incomplete, it may be rejected by a written order specifying the material omitted from the application, or the city may notify the applicant of the material omitted and provide an opportunity to submit the missing material. If the wireless application is incomplete, all permits that must be acted upon by the same date as that application will also be deemed incomplete, or denied. If any permit that must be acted upon by the same date as the wireless application is incomplete, both it and the wireless application shall be declared incomplete, or denied. 
(Ord. No. 1932, § 7, 9-24-2018; Ord. No. 1933, § 7, 11-26-2018)  
Sec. 20-60.8. - Termination of permit/breach. 
(a)  For breach. A wireless telecommunications permit may be revoked for failure to comply with the conditions of the permit, franchise or applicable law. Upon revocation, the wireless telecommunications facility must be removed; provided that removal of support structure owned by City, a utility, or another entity authorized to maintain a support structure in the right-of-way need not be removed, but must be restored to its prior condition, except as specifically permitted by the City. All costs incurred by the City in connection with the revocation and removal shall be paid by entities who own or control any part of the wireless telecommunications facility. 
(b)  For installation without a permit. A wireless telecommunications facility installed without a wireless permit (except for those exempted by this article) must be removed; provided that removal of support structure owned by City, a utility, or another entity authorized to maintain a support structure in the right-of-way need not be removed, but must be restored to its prior condition, except as specifically permitted by the City. All costs incurred by the City in connection with the revocation and removal shall be paid by entities who own or control any part of the wireless telecommunications facility. 
(c)  Term. A wireless permit, other than a permit issued pursuant to an eligible facilities request, shall be valid for a period of five (5) years. An eligible facilities permit shall expire at the same time the permit for the underlying existing wireless telecommunications facility expires. A person holding a wireless telecommunications permit must either remove the wireless telecommunications facility upon expiration (provided that removal of support structure owned by City, a utility, or another entity authorized to maintain a support structure in the right-of-way need not be removed, but must be restored to its prior condition, except as specifically permitted by the City); or, at least ninety (90) days prior to expiration, must submit an application to renew the permit, which application must demonstrate that the visual impact of the wireless telecommunications facility cannot be reduced. The wireless telecommunications facility may remain in place until the application is acted upon by the City, and any appeals from the City's decision exhausted. 
(d)  Municipal infraction. Any violation of this ordinance will be subject to the same penalties as a violation of the City of Laurel Code, Article II, Roads and Sidewalks. 
(Ord. No. 1932, § 8, 9-24-2018; Ord. No. 1933, § 8, 11-26-2018)  
Sec. 20-60.9. - Vertical infrastructure controlled by city. 
The City, as a matter of policy, will negotiate agreements for use of City-owned or controlled light standards and traffic signals in the public rights-of-way. The placement of wireless telecommunications facilities on those structures shall be subject to the agreement. The agreement shall specify the compensation to the City for use of the structures. The person seeking the agreement shall additionally reimburse the City for all costs the City incurs in connection with its review of, and action upon the person's request for an agreement. 
(Ord. No. 1932, § 9, 9-24-2018)  
Sec. 20-60.10. - Nondiscrimination. 
In establishing the rights, obligations and conditions set forth in this article, it is the intent of the City to treat each applicant or public right-of-way user in a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory manner, to the extent required by law, and with considerations that may be unique to the technologies, situation and legal status of each particular applicant or request for use of the public rights-of-way.
