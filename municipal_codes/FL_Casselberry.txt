PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Casselberry, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1982 Code, as supplemented through March 26, 1990, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1982 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of Chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between Sections 3-1 and 3-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 3-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter.

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Mary Rose DiMarco and Alyce A. Whitson, Supervising Editors, and Connie Timmons, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Jack Schluckebier, City Manager, Ken McIntosh, City Attorney, and Thelma McPherson, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

Sec. 2-5. - Community redevelopment trust fund. 
(a)  There is hereby established and created in accordance with the provisions of the Act, a Community Redevelopment Trust Fund (the "fund") for the Community Redevelopment Area, which fund shall be utilized and expended for the purposes of, and in accordance with, the Plan, including any amendments or modifications thereto approved by the City Commission including any "community redevelopment," as that term is defined in F.S. § 163.340(9) under the Plan. 
(b)  The monies to be allocated to and deposited into the fund shall be used to finance "community redevelopment" within the Area according to tax increment revenues attributed to the Area, which shall be appropriated for the Agency. The Agency shall utilize the funds and revenues paid into, and earned by, the fund for community redevelopment purposes as provided in the Plan and as permitted by law. The fund shall exist for the duration of the "community redevelopment" undertaken by the agency pursuant to the Plan to the extent permitted by the Act. (Monies shall be held in the fund by the City for, and on behalf of, the Agency, and disbursed from the fund as provided by the Agency.) 
(c)  Commencing in the tax year 2000, there shall be paid into the fund each year by the City of Casselberry as the "taxing authority" as that term is defined in F.S. § 163.340(2), levying ad valorem taxes within the Community Redevelopment Area, a sum equal to 95 percent of the incremental increase in ad valorem taxes levied each year by the taxing authority, as calculated in accordance with Section 5 and the Act, based on the base tax year established in Section 4 (such annual sum being hereinafter referred to as the "tax increment.") 
(d)  The most recent tax roll used in connection with the taxation of property prior to the effective date of this Section shall be the preliminary assessment roll of taxable real property in Seminole County, Florida, prepared by the Property Appraiser of Seminole County, Florida, and filed with the Department of Revenue pursuant to F.S. § 193.1142, 1990, reflecting valuation of real property for purposes of ad valorem taxation as of January 1, 1995 (the "base year value"), and all deposits into the fund shall be in the amount of tax increment calculated as provided in Subsection (e), below, based upon increases in valuation of taxable real property from the base year value. 
(e)  The tax increment shall be determined and appropriated annually by the taxing authority and, commencing in the tax year 2000, shall be an amount equal to 95 percent of the differences between: 
(1)  That amount of ad valorem taxes levied each year by all taxing authorities on taxable real property within the geographic boundaries in the Community Redevelopment Area; and 
(2)  That amount of ad valorem taxes which would have been produced by the rate upon which the tax is levied each year by or for all taxing authorities, upon the total of the assessed value of the taxable real property in the Community Redevelopment Area as shown upon the assessment roll used in connection with the taxation of such property by all taxing authorities, prior to the effective date of this Section. 
(f)  The taxing authority shall annually appropriate to, and cause to be deposited in, the fund the tax increment determined pursuant to the Act and Subsection (e), above, at the beginning of each fiscal year thereof as provided in the Act. The obligation of the taxing authority to annually appropriate the tax increment for deposit in the fund shall commence immediately upon the effective date of this Section and continue to the extent permitted by the Act so long as any indebtedness pledging "increment revenue" has been paid. 
(g)  The fund shall be established and maintained as a separate trust fund by the Agency so that the fund may be promptly and effectively administered and utilized by the Agency expeditiously and without undue delay for its statutory purpose pursuant to the Plan. 
(h)  The governing body of the Agency shall be the trustees of the fund and shall be responsible for the receipt, custody, disbursement, accountability, management, investments and proper application of all monies paid into the fund. 
(i)  The potential consolidation of the Casselberry Community Redevelopment Agency with other community redevelopment areas in a multi-jurisdictional Community Redevelopment Agency shall be optional with regard to the City of Casselberry. All documents of creation and implementation of the Community Redevelopment Agency shall provide for the contingent future transfer of any and all projects, programs, assets, property, funds, obligations and liabilities to Seminole County and/or a multi-jurisdictional or countywide Community Redevelopment Agency established by Seminole County; provided, however, that any funds on account at the time of termination, expiration or dissolution of the City of Casselberry Community Redevelopment Agency that are not encumbered or pledged as security for any indebtedness shall be transferred to the City of Casselberry for use, as the City of Casselberry deems fit, within the proposed City of Casselberry Central City District; provided, further, however, that any real or personal property that has been purchased with Community Redevelopment Agency funds shall become the property of the City of Casselberry unless pledged or encumbered. 
(j)  As provided in Seminole County Resolution No. 98-R-181, commencing in the tax year 1998, 70 percent of the increment revenues derived by Seminole County for those properties located within the Casselberry Community Redevelopment Agency's redevelopment area shall be appropriated by Seminole County and deposited in the Casselberry Community Redevelopment Agency Trust Fund in accordance with F.S. § 163.387 (1997). Such increment revenues, when deposited into the Trust Fund, may be used by the Casselberry Community Redevelopment Agency in a manner consistent with its redevelopment plan and with general law. Any such funds may be pledged as collateral for the repayment of bond revenues, consistent with F.S. ch. 163, pt. III (1997) and general law. This funding shall continue through the existing term of the Casselberry Redevelopment Plan.

State Law reference- Similar provisions, F.S. § 162.05 
Sec. 2-149. - Special magistrate selection; qualifications; compensation; duties and powers; policies. 
(a)  Selection. If the City Commission chooses to appoint a Special Magistrate, a committee composed of the City Manager, the Building Official, City Attorney and the Community Development Director, shall solicit applications from persons willing to serve as special magistrate, shall interview and evaluate applicants, and shall make recommendations to the City Commission regarding the designation of a special magistrate under this subpart. 
(b)  Qualifications. Special Magistrates shall be members of the Florida Bar in good standing for five or more years. The Special Magistrate must demonstrate satisfactory knowledge of municipal law and the general procedures for enforcement of municipal codes, and must demonstrate a temperament suitable for the exercise of the quasi-judicial powers vested in each special magistrate 
(c)  Compensation. A special magistrate so designated shall be compensated as agreed upon by the Special Magistrate and the City Manager. 
(d)  Duties and powers. Special Magistrates shall have the same duties, powers, and limitation on powers as those conferred on the Board under this Article, as the context permits. 
(e)  Policies. 
(1)  Should the City Commission appoint a Special Magistrate, the City Attorney may attend the code enforcement hearings conducted by the Special Magistrate and represent the City staff in the presentation of cases, or the Code Enforcement Officer may present the cases, at the option of the Community Development Director. 
(2)  Hearings before a Special Magistrate shall be conducted as often as necessary. At any hearing, the Special Magistrate may set a future hearing date. All hearings before the Special Magistrate shall be open to the public. 
(Ord. No. 13-1400, § 5, 1-13-14) 
Sec. 2-150. - Jurisdiction. 
    The Code Enforcement Board and the Special Magistrate shall have the jurisdiction and authority to hear and decide alleged violations of any ordinances or codes in force in the City. The jurisdiction of the Board and Special Magistrate shall not be exclusive. Any alleged violation of any codes or ordinances may be pursued by additional or supplemental means, including appropriate remedy in court, at the option of the administrative official whose responsibility it is to enforce that respective code or ordinances. 
(Ord. No. 99-928, § 1, 3-1-99; Ord. No. 13-1400, § 6, 1-13-14) 
Sec. 2-151. - Enforcement procedure. 
(a)  It shall be the duty of the Code Enforcement Officer to initiate enforcement proceedings of the various codes and ordinances; however, no member of the Code Enforcement Board shall have the power to initiate such enforcement proceedings. 
(b)  Except as provided in Subsections (c) and (d) of this Section, if a violation of a code or ordinance is found, the Code Enforcement Officer shall notify the violator and give him a reasonable time to correct the violation. If the violation continues beyond the time specified for correction, the Code Enforcement Officer shall notify the Board and request a hearing. The Board, through its clerical staff, shall schedule a hearing, and written notice of the hearing shall be hand delivered or mailed as provided in Section 2-157. At the option of the Code Enforcement Board, notice may additionally be served by publication as provided in Section 2-157. If the violation is corrected and then recurs or if the violation is not corrected by the time specified for correction by the Code Enforcement Officer, the case may be presented to the Code Enforcement Board even if the violation has been corrected prior to the board hearing and the notice shall so state. 
(c)  If a repeat violation is found, the Code Enforcement Officer shall notify the violator but is not required to give the violator a reasonable time to correct the violation. The Code Enforcement Officer, upon notifying the violator of a repeat violation, shall notify the Code Enforcement Board and request a hearing. The Code Enforcement Board, through its clerical staff, shall schedule a hearing and shall provide notice pursuant to Section 2-157. The case may be presented to the Code Enforcement Board even if the repeat violation has been corrected prior to the Board hearing, and the notice shall so state. If the repeat violation has been corrected, the Code Enforcement Board retains the right to schedule a hearing to determine costs and impose the payment of reasonable enforcement fees upon the repeat violator. The repeat violator may choose to waive his or her rights to this hearing and pay said costs as determined by the Code Enforcement Board. For purposes of this Section, the term "repeat violation" means a violation of a provision of a code or ordinance by a person who has been previously found through a code enforcement board or any other quasi-judicial or judicial process, to have violated or who has admitted violating the same provision within five years prior to the violation, notwithstanding the violations occur at different locations. 
(d)  If the Code Enforcement Officer has reason to believe a violation or the condition causing the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the Code Enforcement Officer shall make reasonable effort to notify the violator and may immediately notify the Code Enforcement Board and request a hearing. 
(e)  If the owner of property which is subject to an enforcement proceeding before the Code Enforcement Board or court transfers ownership of the property between the time the initial pleading or notice was served and the time of the hearing, such owner shall: 
(1)  Disclose, in writing, the existence and the nature of the proceeding to the prospective transferee. 
(2)  Deliver to the prospective transferee a copy of the pleadings, notices, and other materials relating to the code enforcement proceeding received by the transferor. 
(3)  Disclose, in writing, to the prospective transferee that the new owner will be responsible for compliance with the applicable code and with orders issued in the code enforcement proceeding. 
(4)  File a notice with the Code Enforcement Officer to the transfer of the property, with the identity and address of the new owner and copies of the disclosures made to the new owner, within five days after the date of the transfer. 
A failure to make the disclosures described in Subsections (1), (2), (3) and (4) above before the transfer creates a rebuttable presumption of fraud. If the property is transferred before the hearing, the proceeding shall not be dismissed, but the new owner shall be provided a reasonable period of time to correct the violation before the hearing is held. 
(Ord. No. 99-928, § 1, 3-1-99; Ord. No. 00-975, § 1, 2-7-00; Ord. No. 13-1400, § 7, 1-13-14)

A hearing also may be called upon written notice signed by at least three members of the Board. Notice of hearing shall be circulated to all members of the Board. Minutes shall be kept of all hearings of the Board, and all hearings and proceedings shall be open to the public. The City Manager, upon request of the City Commission, shall provide clerical and administrative personnel as may be reasonably required by the Board for the proper performance of its duties. 
(b)  Special emergency meetings of the Board may be convened by the chairperson upon the giving of notice thereof to each of the other members of the Board. Written notice of a special emergency meeting shall be delivered at least 24 hours prior to convening the Board. 
(c)  Each case before the Board shall be presented by the Code Enforcement Officer, a member of the City's Administrative Staff or special counsel. If the City prevails in prosecuting a case before the Code Enforcement Board, it shall be entitled to recover all costs incurred in prosecuting the case before the Board, and such costs may be included in the lien authorized under Section 2-154(e). 
(d)  The Board shall proceed to hear the cases on the agenda for that day. All testimony shall be under oath and shall be recorded. 
(e)  The Board shall take testimony from the Code Enforcement Officer, the alleged violator and all witnesses called before the Board. 
(f)  Formal rules of evidence shall not apply, but fundamental due process shall be observed and shall govern all proceedings. Irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded, but all other evidence of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs shall be admissible, whether or not that evidence would be technically admissible in a trial before the state courts. Any part of the evidence may be received in written form acceptable to the Board. 
(g)  Four members of the Board shall constitute a quorum for the lawful performance of the duties of the Board at any meeting. 
(h)  At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board shall issue findings of fact based on the evidence of record and conclusions of law, and shall issue an order affording the proper relief consistent with the evidence and the powers granted herein. 
(1)  The findings shall be by motion approved by a majority of those members present and voting, except that at least four members of the Board must vote in order for the action to be official. 
(2)  The Board's order shall be pronounced orally at the meeting, and shall be reduced to writing and mailed by regular U. S. Mail to the alleged violator.

(4)  A certified copy of such order may be recorded in the public records of the county and shall constitute notice to any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest or assigns if the violation concerns real property, and the findings therein shall be binding upon the violator and, if the violation concerns real property, any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest or assigns. If an order is recorded in the public records pursuant to this Subsection and the order is complied with by the date specified in the order, the Code Enforcement Board shall issue an order acknowledging compliance that shall be recorded in the public records. A hearing is not required to issue such an order acknowledging compliance.

Sec. 2-154. - Administrative fines and liens, costs of repair; and filing of liens. 
(a)  The Code Enforcement Board, upon notification by the Code Enforcement Officer that an order of the Code Enforcement Board has not been complied with by the set time or, upon finding that a repeat violation has been committed, may order the violator to pay a fine in an amount specified in this Section for each day the violation continues past the date set by the Code Enforcement Board for compliance, or, in the case of a repeat violation, for each day the repeat violation continues, beginning with the date the repeat violation is found to have occurred by the Code Enforcement Officer. In addition, if the violation is a violation described in Section 2-151(d), the board shall notify the City Commission, which may make all reasonable repairs which are required to bring the property into compliance and charge the violator with the reasonable cost of the repairs along with the fine imposed pursuant to this Section. 
(b)  A fine imposed pursuant to this Section shall not exceed $250 per day for a first violation and shall not exceed $500 per day for a repeat violation, and, in addition, may include all costs of repairs pursuant to Subsection (a). However, if the Code Enforcement Board finds the violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it may impose a fine not to exceed $5,000 per violation. 
(c)  In determining the amount of the fine, if any, the Code Enforcement Board shall consider the following factors: 
(1)  The gravity of the violation; 
(2)  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; and 
(3)  Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
(d)  The Code Enforcement Board may reduce a fine imposed pursuant to this Section. 
(e)  A certified copy of an order imposing a fine may be recorded in the public records of the county and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. Upon petition to the circuit court, the order may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including levy against the personal property, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed pursuant to this Section shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered pursuant to this Section, whichever occurs first. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this Section runs in favor of the City council and the City may execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered pursuant to this Section. 
(f)  After three months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the Code Enforcement Board may authorize the City Attorney to foreclose on the lien or to sue to recover a money judgment for the amount of the lien plus any accrued interest. No lien created pursuant to the provisions of this Section may be foreclosed on real property which is a homestead under Section 4, Article X of the State Constitution. The money judgment provisions of this Section shall not apply to real property or personal property which is covered under Section 4(a), Article X of the State Constitution.

State Law reference- Similar provisions, F.S. § 162.09. 
Sec. 2-155. - Duration of lien. 
    No lien provided for under this Section shall continue for a period in excess of 20 years after the certified copy of an order imposing a fine has been recorded, unless within that time an action commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to Section 2-154(f). In an action to foreclose on a lien or for a money judgment, the prevailing party is entitled to recover all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee, that it incurs in the action. The City shall be entitled to collect all costs incurred in recording and satisfying a valid lien. The continuation of the lien affected by the commencement of the action shall not be good against creditors or subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, unless a notice of lis pendens is recorded.

Sec. 2-157. - Notices. 
(a)  All notices required in this Division shall be provided to the alleged violator by certified mail, return receipt requested; by hand delivery by the sheriff or law enforcement officer of the City Code Enforcement Officer, or other person designated by the City Commission; or by leaving the notice at the violator's usual place of residence with any person residing therein who is above 15 years of age and informing such person of the contents of the notice. In the case of commercial premises, leaving the notice with the manager or other person in charge. 
(b)  In addition to providing notice as set forth in Subsection (a) of this Section, at the option of the Code Enforcement Board, notice may also be served by publication or posting as follows: 
(1)  Such notice shall be published once during each week for four consecutive weeks, with four publications being sufficient, in a newspaper of general circulation in the City. The newspaper shall meet such requirements as are prescribed under F.S. ch. 50 for legal and official advertisements.

(4)  Notice by publication or posting may run concurrently with, or may follow, an attempt to provide notice by hand delivery or by mail as required under Subsection (a) of this Section. 
(c)  Evidence that an attempt has been made to hand deliver or mail notice as provided in Subsection (a) together with proof of publication or posting as provided in Subsection (1) shall be sufficient to show that the notice requirement, of this part has been met, without regard to whether or not the alleged violator actually received the notice.

Sec. 2-158. - Application for satisfaction or release of code enforcement liens. 
    Where a certified copy of an order imposing a penalty or fine, as described above in Section 2-154, has been recorded in the public records and has become a lien against the land and/or property of the violator/property owner, such violator/property owner may apply for a satisfaction or release of such lien as follows: 
(a)  Upon full payment by the violator/property owner/property owner of the fine or penalty imposed in accordance with this chapter, the City Manager or designee is hereby authorized to execute and record a satisfaction of lien.

(c)  The application shall include, but may not be limited to the following: 
(1)  The code enforcement case number; 
(2)  The date upon which the violator/property owner brought the subject property into compliance with the City Code; 
(3)  The factual basis upon which the violator/property owner believes the application for reduction or forgiveness of the lien should be granted; 
(4)  The terms upon which the violator/property owner believes a satisfaction or release of lien should be granted; 
(5)  The reasons, if any, compliance was not obtained prior to the order of penalty or fine being recorded; 
(6)  The reduction in penalty or fine sought by the violator/property owner; 
(7)  Any other information which the violator/property owner deems pertinent to the request, including but not limited to the circumstances that exist which would warrant the reduction or forgiveness of the penalty or fine; and 
(8)  This application shall be executed under oath and sworn to in the presence of a notary public. 
(d)  The violator/property owner shall submit at the time of application payment to the City in the amount necessary to reimburse the City for its costs associated with recording the order imposing a penalty or fine and the requested satisfaction or release of lien. These costs are non-refundable, without regard for the final disposition of the application for satisfaction or release of lien. 
(e)  Upon receipt of the application for satisfaction or release of lien and payment provided above, the Fire Chief or designee shall confirm through the Code Enforcement Officer that the violation which resulted in the order imposing penalty or fine has been brought into compliance. If the violator/property owner has been brought into compliance and there is no current code violation upon the property in question, the Community Development Director or designee shall place the application upon the agenda of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Code Enforcement Board for the City of Casselberry.

(5)  Any financial hardship; and 
(6)  Any other mitigating circumstances which may warrant the reduction or satisfaction of the penalty or fine. 
(h)  After a recommendation has been rendered by the Code Enforcement Board, the Community Development Director or designee shall place the application for satisfaction or release of lien upon the agenda of the next regularly scheduled City Commission meeting. The City Commission may take action solely based upon the sworn application and recommendation of the code enforcement board, and information previously provided by the violator/property owner to the Code Enforcement Board, in considering the application for satisfaction or release of lien. 
(i)  The City Commission may approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application to satisfy or release the lien. If the City Commission approves the application to satisfy or release the lien and the approval is conditioned upon the violator/property owner paying a reduced penalty, fine, or any other condition, the satisfaction or release of lien shall not be prepared or recorded until the condition(s) placed by the Commission have been satisfied. 
(j)  The violator/property owner shall have 30 days in which to comply with the conditions imposed by the City Commission. Failure of the violator/property owner to comply will result in the automatic denial of the application for satisfaction or release of lien. 
(k)  If the application is denied or if the application is automatically denied due to the failure of the violator/property owner to comply with the conditions imposed by the City Commission, the violator/property owner shall thereafter be barred from applying for a subsequent reduction or forgiveness of the lien for a period of one year from the date of denial. During the one-year period, the lien may only be satisfied and released upon full payment of the fine or penalty imposed in accordance with this chapter.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Sec. 14-1. - Purpose and intent; findings; jurisdiction; statutory authority. 
    The purpose of this Article is to regulate, within the City of Casselberry, Florida, those games, machines or devices which are unlawful under F.S. ch. 849, because the machines are slot machines or devices as defined herein and in Chapter 849. The City Commission finds that evidence has been propounded indicating that slot machines or devices can lead to gambling addictions, along with the secondary consequences that such addictions impose upon the community, including increases in crime, debt, suicide and other negative effects on the health, safety, morals and welfare of the residents and visitors of the areas where these devices exist. By law, local governments have all powers of self-government which do not conflict with Florida laws, including those police powers sufficient to eliminate public nuisances and regulate activities which would otherwise cause harm to the public.

(1)  Sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities that are presently uncontrolled or not adequately controlled by the operators of the establishments or businesses. Further, there are presently no mechanisms or inadequate mechanisms to make the owners of these businesses or establishments responsible for the activities that occur on their premises. 
(2)  Certain workers of certain sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments defined in this Article engage in a higher incidence of certain types of illicit sexual behavior than workers of other business establishments. 
(3)  Sexual acts, including masturbation, and oral and anal sex, occur at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments, especially those which provide private or semi-private areas, booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos, live sex shows and those having physical interaction between workers and customers. 
(4)  Offering and providing such private spaces encourages such previously mentioned activities, which create unhealthy conditions. 
(5)  Persons frequent certain adult theaters, adult arcades, and other sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments for the purpose of engaging in sex within the premises of such businesses and establishments. 
(6)  At least 50 communicable diseases may be spread by activities occurring in sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments, including, but not limited to, syphilis, gonorrhea, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV-AIDS), genital herpes, hepatitis B, Non A, Non B amebiasis, salmonella infections and shigella infections. 
(7)  Since 1981 and to the present, there has been an increasing cumulative number of reported cases of AIDS caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the United States 600 in 1982, 2,200 in 1983, 4,600 in 1984, 8,555 in 1985 and 253,448 through December 31, 1992. 
(8)  As of December 31, 1995, there have been 51,838 reported cases of AIDS in the State of Florida. 
(9)  From 1981 to June 1996, the number of living persons testing positive for the HIV antibody with AIDS symptoms has risen to 73,217 in the 28 states having confidential reporting requirements. 
(10)  The number of cases of early (less than one year) syphilis in the United States reported annually has risen, with 33,613 cases reported in 1982 and 45,200 through November of 1990. 
(11)  The number of cases of gonorrhea in the United States reported annually remains in a high level, with over one-half million cases being reported in 1990. 
(12)  The surgeon general of the United States, in his report of October 22, 1986, has advised the American public that AIDS and HIV infection may be transmitted through sexual contact, intravenous drug abuse, exposure to infected blood and blood components, and from an infected mother to her newborn. 
(13)  According to the best scientific evidence, AIDS and HIV infection, as well as syphilis and gonorrhea, are principally transmitted by sexual acts. 
(14)  Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are unhealthy, in part, because the activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of the activities and the failure of owners and operators of the facilities to self-regulate those activities and maintain those facilities. 
(15)  Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the areas of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments where persons view "adult" oriented films. 
(16)  The findings noted in paragraphs number 1 through 15 and as set forth hereinafter raise substantial governmental concerns. 
(17)  Sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
(18)  A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and the operators of the sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments. Further, such a licensing procedure will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on the operators to see that the business or establishment is run in a manner consistent with the good order, health, safety and welfare of its patrons and workers, as well as the citizens of the City. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual operator of the business or establishment, fully in possession and control of the premises and activities occurring therein. 
(19)  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting on premises with adult booths advances a substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring in adult theaters. 
(20)  Requiring licensees of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments to keep information regarding current workers and certain past workers will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working at such businesses and establishments. 
(21)  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the sexually oriented business and adult entertainment establishments, where such information is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses, will aid in preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. 
(22)  It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain workers who may engage in the conduct which this Article is designed to prevent or who are likely to be witnesses to such activity. 
(23)  The fact that an applicant for an adult entertainment establishment or sexually oriented business license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to the rational assumption that the applicant may engage in that conduct in contravention of this Article. 
(24)  Commercial establishments exist or may exist within the City and other nearby cities and counties in central Florida where adult entertainment material is possessed, displayed, exhibited, distributed and/or sold for commercial purposes in the form of books, magazines, periodicals or other printer material, or photographs, films, motion pictures, prints, videotapes, slides, computer digital graphic recordings or other visual representations or recordings, or recordings or other audio matter, or instruments, novelties, devices, or paraphernalia which depict, illustrate, describe or relate to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas. 
(25)  Commercial establishments exist or may exist within the City and other nearby cities or counties in central Florida where adult entertainment and sexually oriented commercial activities in the form of nude, semi-nude, or topless dancers, entertainers, performers, or other individuals, who, for commercial gain, perform or are presented while displaying or exposing specified anatomical areas; or engage in straddle dancing or touching with customers. 
(26)  Commercial sexually oriented businesses exist or operate or may exist or operate within the City or other nearby cities or counties in central Florida where sexually oriented services are offered for commercial or pecuniary gain in the form of commercial physical contact, escort services and other services providing sexual encounters. The workers of such sexually oriented businesses operating in central Florida engage in physical contact or touching with customers including, but not limited to, acts of prostitution, or encourage or entice the customers to engage in lewdness. 
(27)  The activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments occur at establishments and businesses which operate primarily for the purpose of making a profit and, as such, are subject to regulation by the City in the interest of the good order, health, safety, economy, property values, morals and general welfare of the people, businesses and industries of the City. A major industry which is important to the community's economic welfare is tourism by persons seeking to bring children to visit central Florida attractions who wish to stay in a community with a family atmosphere not dominated by commercialized sexual themes. 
(28)  When the activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are present in establishments and businesses, other activities which are illegal, unsafe, or unhealthful tend to accompany them, concentrate around them, and be aggravated by them. Such other activities include, but are not limited to, prostitution, pandering, solicitation for prostitution, lewd and lascivious behavior, exposing minors to harmful materials, possession, distribution and transportation of obscene materials, sale or possession of controlled substances, and violent crimes against persons and property. 
(29)  When the activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments are competitively exploited in establishments and businesses, they tend to attract an undesirable number of transients, blight neighborhoods, adversely affect neighboring businesses, lower real property values, promote the particular crimes described above and, ultimately, lead residents and businesses to move to other locations. 
(30)  Sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments often have exterior signs or exterior appearance that lower the surrounding property values and contribute to urban decline. 
(31)  In order to reverse urban blight, the City of Casselberry has established a Community Redevelopment Area pursuant to F.S. ch. 163. Sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments that contribute to urban blight operate at cross-purposes with Community Redevelopment Areas. 
(32)  The activities occurring at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments sometimes occur in establishments and businesses concurrent with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages which concurrence leads to a further increase in criminal activity, unsafe activity, and disturbances of the peace and order of the surrounding community and creates additional hazards to the health and safety of customers and workers and further depreciates the value of adjoining real property harming the economic welfare of the surrounding community and adversely affecting the quality of life, commerce, and community environment. 
(33)  Physical contact or touching within sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments between workers exhibiting specified anatomical areas and customers poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and social diseases. 
(34)  In order to preserve and safeguard the good order, health, morals, safety, and general welfare of the people of the City it is necessary and advisable for the City to regulate the conduct of owners, managers, operators, agents, workers, entertainers, performers, and customers at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments. 
(35)  The potential dangers to the good order, morals, health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the City posed by permitting a sexually oriented business or adult entertainment establishment to operate without first meeting the requirements for obtaining a license under this Article are so great as to require the licensure of such establishments prior to their being permitted to operate. 
(36)  Requiring operators of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments to keep records of information concerning workers and certain recent past workers as well as customer contracts and other matters and materials will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by making it difficult for minors to work at or be customers in such establishments. 
(37)  Reserved. 
(38)  Straddle dancing, unregulated private performances, and enclosed adult booths in sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments have resulted in indiscriminate commercial sex between strangers and poses a threat to the health of the participants and promotes the spread of communicable sexually transmitted diseases. Straddle dancing is primarily conduct rather than communication or expression. 
(39)  Workers at sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments engage in a higher incidence of certain types of unhealthy or criminal behavior than workers of other establishments and businesses including, but not limited to, a very high incidence of illegal prostitution or engaging in lewdness in violation of F.S. ch. 796, operation without occupational licenses and illegal and unlicensed massage. 
(40)  Physical contact or touching between workers of sexually oriented businesses and adult entertainment establishments and customers poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and sexually transmissible diseases. 
(41)  The practice of not paying workers at sexually oriented businesses and requiring them to earn their entire income from tips or gratuities from their customers who are predisposed to want sexual activity has resulted in a high incidence of prostitution and crimes related to lewdness by workers. 
(42)  Sexually oriented businesses involve activities that are pure conduct engaged in for the purpose of making a profit, rather than speech or expressive activity and, therefore, are subject to and require increased regulation to protect the health, good order, morals, welfare and safety of the community. 
(43)  Requiring sexually oriented businesses to post a listing of services provided and restrict services to those listed as well as maintaining a customer contract and transaction record in a daily register will discourage incidents of criminal behavior such as lewdness and prostitution thereby further safeguarding the health of both workers and customers and will assist facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects if criminal acts do occur. 
(44)  This Article shall not be construed as opting the City of Casselberry out of the Seminole County Public Decency ordinance. 
(45)  The general welfare, health, good order, morals and safety of the citizens of the City will be promoted by the enactment of this Article. 
(c)  Intent. It is the intent of this Article to protect and preserve the good order, health, peace, morals, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the City of Casselberry. This Article regulates conduct and is not an ordinance that affects the use of land as contemplated by F.S. § 166.041 (1997). 
(d)  Authority. This Article is enacted under the constitutionally derived home rule power of the City of Casselberry in the interest of the good order, health, morals, peace, safety, and general welfare of the people of the City. 
(e)  Whereas clauses. It is the City Commission's further intention to accomplish those intents and purposes expressed by the City Commission in the recital (whereas clauses) of the ordinance from which this Section derives, each of which are incorporated by reference into this Section. 
(f)  Speech protection. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit constitutionally protected expression or speech. This Article is intended to reasonably regulate the adult entertainment industry and sexually oriented businesses which engage in commercial activities involving acts or services of a sexually explicit nature or which involve acts or services involving matters which are sexual in nature.

(Ord. No. 99-934, § I, 6-7-99) 
Sec. 14-69. - Obscenity/indecent exposure unlawful. 
    As a matter of State and Federal law, obscenity is unlawful in the City of Casselberry. Likewise, State law prohibits indecent exposure.

The hearing officer shall render a final decision on the appeal within 60 days of the City Manager's receipt of licensee's written notice of challenge. 
(14)  Hearing officers may allow the parties to submit written proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law following the hearing and shall advise the parties of the timetable for so doing, if allowed. 
(15)  At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall issue an order setting forth findings of fact, based on evidence of record, and issue conclusions of law regarding whether the suspension or revocation will become or remain effective, and shall render relief in the order affording the proper relief consistent with powers granted in this Section.

DIVISION 2. - BEGGING, PANHANDLING AND SOLICITING ON PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROPERTY 

Sec. 26-89. - Legislative findings. 
    The City Commission recognizes a constitutional right to beg, panhandle or solicit in a peaceful and non-threatening manner. The City Commission finds, however, that an increase in aggressive begging, panhandling or soliciting throughout the City has become extremely disturbing and disruptive to residents and businesses, and has contributed not only to the loss of access to and enjoyment of public places, but also to an enhanced sense of fear, intimidation and disorder. 
    Aggressive begging, panhandling or soliciting usually includes approaching or following pedestrians, repetitive begging, panhandling, or soliciting despite refusals, the use of abusive or profane language, unwanted physical contact, or the intentional blocking of pedestrian and vehicular traffic. The City Commission further finds that the presence of persons who solicit money from other persons at or near outdoor cafes, automated teller machines, the entrance and exits of buildings, certain public events as more particularly described in this Article, and payphones is especially troublesome because said persons cannot readily escape from the undesired conduct. Such activity often carries with it an implicit threat to both persons and property. 
    The City Commission further finds that the activity of begging, panhandling or soliciting presents significant public health, welfare and safety concerns and crowd control problems when such activities are conducted on or near public streets which are in use by vehicular traffic because these activities involve the process of a person requesting a donation from an occupant or operator of a vehicle which is in traffic, that vehicle occupant or operator must consider the request, and, if the vehicle occupant or operator decides to fulfill the request, that person must reach for a wallet, search for money, or write a check, all while that person and vehicle are located on a public street in use by vehicular traffic. Based on the foregoing, the City Commission finds that the activity of begging, panhandling or soliciting from occupants or operators of vehicles located on streets in use by vehicular traffic distracts drivers from their primary duty to watch traffic and potential hazards in the road, observe all traffic signals or warnings and move through the city's streets and intersections in a lawful and safe manner and creates a potential safety hazard and poses a substantial risk to the public, and impedes the free flow of traffic on the streets within the city resulting in the delay and obstruction of the public's free flow of travel on the city's streets. The City Commission further finds that the safety of beggars, panhandlers, solicitors, pedestrians and operators and occupants of vehicles is at significant risk when such activities occur because the nature of these activities often entails beggars, panhandlers or solicitors standing on traffic medians, bicycle paths and public streets in use by vehicular traffic, property only meant for the use and control of vehicular traffic and not begging, panhandling or soliciting. 
    It is not the purpose and intent of this Article to prohibit begging, panhandling or soliciting in public areas when such activities will not interfere with vehicular traffic and cause traffic safety and traffic flow concerns or when such activities will not otherwise cause any public health, welfare and safety concerns. For example, beggars, panhandlers or solicitors may conduct their activities on public sidewalks so long as they are not conducting transactions with operators or occupants of vehicles in traffic and are otherwise in compliance with this Code. 
    This law is timely and appropriate because current city ordinances are insufficient to address the aforementioned problems. The restrictions contained herein are neither overbroad nor vague and are narrowly tailored to serve a substantial governmental interest. Moreover, this Article only restricts begging, panhandling and soliciting in certain public places while preserving ample alternative areas for the valid exercise of First Amendment constitutional rights. 
    The law is not intended to limit any persons from exercising their constitutional right to beg, panhandle or solicit funds, picket, protest or engage in other constitutionally protected activity. Its goal is instead to protect citizens from the fear and intimidation accompanying certain kinds of begging, panhandling or solicitation that have become an unwelcome presence in the city, and to prohibit aggressive begging, panhandling and solicitation, and begging, panhandling and solicitation in certain public places based upon significant governmental interests. 
(Ord. No. 09-1264, § 1, 1-12-09) 
Sec. 26-90. - Begging, panhandling or soliciting on public property, sidewalks and streets; certain designated places prohibited. 
(a)  Purpose. The City Commission finds that any person who begs, panhandles or solicits under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity by unwanted touching, detaining, impeding or intimidation which causes fear or apprehension in another person constitutes a threat to the public health, welfare and safety of the citizenry. The City Commission also finds that any person who intentionally blocks the passage of another person or a vehicle, which requires another person to take evasive action to avoid physical contact, constitutes a threat to the public health, welfare and safety of the citizenry, and is an aggressive panhandler. The City Commission further finds that any person who begs, panhandles or solicits under circumstances where the person being solicited cannot readily escape from the undesired conduct constitutes a threat to the public health, welfare and safety of the citizenry. The City Commission also finds that any person begging, panhandling or soliciting from occupants or operators of vehicles while such vehicles are on the portion of a public street currently in use by vehicular traffic and any person begging, panhandling or soliciting on traffic medians, bicycle paths or publics streets when such property is in use by vehicular traffic poses a threat to public safety and prevents the free flow of traffic on public streets. 
(b)  Definitions. Except where the content otherwise requires, as used in this chapter:

(5)  No person shall stand on a traffic median, bicycle path or public street to beg, panhandle or solicit when to do so would obstruct vehicular traffic.

Sec. 26-91. - Begging, panhandling or soliciting in private buildings and private property; prohibited. 
(a)  Legislative intent, purpose. The City Commission finds that any person who begs, panhandles, or solicits, under circumstances that warrant a justifiable and reasonable alarm or immediate concern for the safety of persons or property in public rooms of private buildings and on private property by unwanted touching, detaining, impeding or intimidation which causes fear or apprehensive in another person constitutes a threat to the public health, welfare and safety of the citizenry. The City Commission further finds that any person who begs, panhandles or solicits under circumstances where the person being solicited cannot readily escape from the undesired conduct constitutes a threat to the public health, welfare and safety of the citizenry. The City Commission has previously also banned aggressive panhandling in residences under Division 1 of this Article.

Sec. 26-92. - Begging, panhandling or soliciting in public buildings and public transportation areas; prohibited. 
(a)  Legislative intent, purpose. The City Commission finds that begging, panhandling or soliciting may interfere with the safe ingress and egress of human and vehicular traffic into public buildings and public transportation areas thereby constituting a threat to the public health, welfare and safety of the citizenry. In order to allow for the safe ingress and egress of human and vehicular traffic into public buildings and public transportation areas, the City Manager or designee is authorized to prohibit begging, panhandling or soliciting within public buildings or designated areas of that public building or public transportation areas upon the request of the owners, lessees, managing or authorizing agents of the public building or areas in accordance with the provisions of this Section.

(2)  If an appeal is filed, the hearing shall be conducted by the Nuisance Abatement Board. In this proceeding, the Board members shall find whether substantial competent evidence existed for the City Manager to prohibit begging, panhandling or soliciting in a public building or area of a public building or public transportation area based upon the criteria set forth in subsection (b) and (c). The Nuisance Abatement Board's decision may be appealed to the City Commission, and the City Commission's decision may be appealed to a court of competent jurisdiction by a petition for a writ of certiorari within 30 days after the rendition of the City Commission's decision regarding the designation.

The City shall not, however, waive any right to collect such local, state or federal costs if they are not included with the consolidated bill and are not charged to the property owner or his agent within the 60-day consolidated billing period. In this regard, the City Clerk shall expect reimbursement of all local, state or federal costs within 30 days of the receipt by the owner or his agent of the bill for these particular costs, fees and so forth.

(Ord. No. 02-1044, § 7 3-25-02) 
Sec. 48-33. - Interpretation of franchise terms. 
(a)  Subject to provisions of Section 48-66, the provisions of this Article will apply to a franchise agreement, and the express terms of this Article will prevail over conflicting or inconsistent provisions in a franchise agreement, unless such franchise agreement expresses an explicit intent to waive a requirement of the Article. 
(b)  The provisions of a franchise agreement will be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes and objectives consistent with this Article and the public interest. Except where federal law or regulation is controlling, a franchise agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida.

Sec. 48-34. - Grant of franchises. 
(a)  Generally, the City may grant a franchise for a period not to exceed ten years, although a longer franchise term up to a 15-year term may be granted if the City Commission finds it would better meet community needs and interests. 
(b)  The City may make the grant of a franchise conditioned upon the completion of construction within a prescribed time or upon the performance of other specific obligations, which are to be set forth in the franchise agreement, specifying that failure to timely comply with the condition will cause the Franchisee to be in material breach of its franchise agreement, and become subject to penalties pursuant to this Article and the franchise agreement. Violations listed in Section 48-60 shall be considered material breaches of this Article. 
(c)  In evaluating an application for a new franchise, the City shall consider among other things, the following factors: the applicant's character, its technical, financial, and legal qualifications to construct and operate the proposed system; the nature of the proposed facilities, equipment and services; the applicant's record in other communities, if any; the economic impact on private property within the proposed service area; the capability of the public rights-of-way to accommodate the proposed system; potential disruption to existing users of the public rights-of-way and the public; and whether the proposal will meet reasonably anticipated community needs and serve the public interest. Where an applicant proposes an overbuild of an existing cable system, the City shall also consider, pursuant to F.S. § 166.046, the economic feasibility of multiple cable operators, the impact on the existing Franchisee, including whether the operations of an existing cable Franchisee will be interfered with or disrupted, and whether any adverse consequences to the public interest will result if the application is granted. 
(d)  The Commission shall hold a public hearing to consider any new application. Based upon the application, the testimony presented at the public hearing, any recommendations of the City Manager, and any other information it deems relevant to the application, the Commission shall decide whether to grant or deny a franchise application and the terms and conditions of a grant. Any grant of a franchise shall be under terms and conditions that are not more favorable or less burdensome than those in an existing franchise. 
(e)  If the Commission grants an initial franchise application, the City Manager and the applicant must agree on the terms of a franchise agreement within 90 calendar days from the date of the adoption of the resolution which approved the grant. This time period may be extended for good cause by the City. If agreement is not reached with the City within 90 calendar days or if the period is not extended by the City, the franchise grant will be null and void without further action by the City. 
(f)  After complying with the above requirements, the Commission, following a public hearing, and considering the testimony presented at the public hearing, any recommendations of the City Manager, and any other relevant information, shall approve or disapprove the proposed franchise agreement by resolution. 
(g)  A Franchisee must demonstrate compliance with the surety, insurance and similar provisions of the franchise agreement.

Sec. 48-35. - Complaints.

(b)  Whenever it is necessary to shut off or interrupt service for the making of repairs, installations, or adjustments, Franchisee shall do so at such times as will cause the least amount of inconvenience to its customers and unless such interruption is unforeseen and immediately necessary, it will give reasonable notice thereof to its customers. 
(c)  The Franchisee shall maintain an office located convenient to the City which shall be open at reasonable hours for receiving complaints from subscribers and non-subscribers. Said complaints shall be investigated and if attributable to the system, corrected within the time frames set forth in Section 48-49 of this Article. 
(Ord. No. 02-1044, § 10, 3-25-02) 
Sec. 48-36. - Rates. 
(a)  Before any service is sold to any customer, a Franchisee shall file with the City Manager its schedule of rates for installation and monthly service charges and any other information required by the Federal rules. 
(b)  Subsequent additions or amendments to rates, service charges and rights and obligations statements shall likewise be filed with the City Manager at least 30 days before the same become effective. Simultaneously, a Franchisee shall also provide subscribers to the cable system with written notification of any such additions or amendments at least 30 days before the same become effective. 
(c)  In the event that any state or federal law or regulation is at any time after the effective date of this Article, enacted, changed, modified, interpreted, amended, repealed or invalidated so as to allow for the City's regulation of rates paid by cable subscribers, the City may, at its option, regulate such rates as permitted by law. 
(d)  Rate regulation proceedings shall be conducted at a duly noticed public hearing to ensure that all interested parties have a reasonable opportunity to present their views. The Commission may conduct such hearings at its regularly scheduled meeting or at a meeting scheduled solely for the purpose of regulating rates. 
(e)  To the extent allowed by state and federal law, nothing in this section shall prevent a Franchisee from applying a surcharge or late payment penalty to subscriber bills to reflect balances due the Franchisee which are delinquent for 20 days or more.

Any primary insurance policy must be issued by a Franchisee having a policyholders' surplus at least five times the amount of the coverage of the policy, and the Franchisee must have management rating in Best's Insurance Guide of BB or better. Franchisee shall obligate itself to notify the City in writing at least 30 days before any alteration, modification, or cancellation of such policy is to become effective, which would result in non-compliance with this provision.

Franchisee shall defend the City in any action or proceeding commenced for the purpose of asserting any claim arising under a Franchisee's performance of its franchise agreement, except for any claim asserted by a Franchisee or asserted by the City against a Franchisee. City shall receive advance consent in writing before settling any dispute that is subject to indemnification by the Franchisee. Nothing herein shall be construed as consent by an agency or subdivision of the State of Florida to be sued by third parties in any matter arising out of this Article, or a franchise agreement; or as a waiver of sovereign immunity by any party to which sovereign immunity applies.

Sec. 48-38. - Service area. 
    The Franchisee shall provide service to the entire City, in accordance with the requirements of Section 48-48(b).

(Ord. No. 02-1044, § 13, 3-25-02) 
Sec. 48-39. - Franchise fee. 
(a)  A Franchisee shall pay the Communications Services Tax provided in the Communications Services Tax Simplification Law, Chapter 202, Florida Statutes, as that law has been and may hereinafter be amended or renumbered and any City of Casselberry Ordinances or resolutions enacted pursuant to such law. In the event that Chapter 202, Florida Statutes, is held to be unconstitutional, invalid, or unenforceable, a Franchisee, as compensation for the privilege granted under a franchise for the use of the public rights-of-way to construct, maintain and operate a cable system, shall pay the City a franchise fee in an amount of either (1) five percent of the Franchisee's gross revenues; or (2) in the event 47 U.S.C. § 542 or other applicable law is amended to permit the City to assess a franchise fee of a greater percentage or amount than that specified in subsection (1) above, or on a broader revenue basis than defined in this chapter, the Franchisee shall during the remaining term of any existing franchise or in a renewal franchise pay the City the new percentage or amount as established at any time by the Commission after a public hearing of which the Franchisee has received notice, provided that the percentage of revenue and the revenue base for the franchise fee do not exceed those paid by Franchisee to any other franchising authority in Seminole, Orange, Osceola, Brevard or Volusia Counties. 
(b)  A Franchisee shall pay the franchise fee due to the City on a quarterly basis. Payment for each quarter shall be made to the City not later than 45 calendar days after the end of each calendar quarter. All payments shall be accompanied by a calculation of gross revenue certified by a certified public accountant or the Franchisee's chief financial officer. 
(c)  A Franchisee shall file with the City, on a quarterly basis with the payment of the franchise fee, a financial statement setting forth the computation of gross revenues used to calculate the franchise fee for the preceding quarter and a detailed explanation of the method of computation showing the revenue derived from each category of the Franchisee's operations. The statement shall be certified by a certified public accountant or the Franchisee's chief financial officer. The Franchisee shall bear the cost of the preparation of such financial statements. 
(d)  Subject to applicable law, no acceptance by the City of any franchise fee payment shall be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim the City may have for additional sums payable. 
(e)  The franchise fee payment is not a payment in lieu of any other tax, fee or assessment. 
(f)  In the event that Florida law so permits, the City may, from time to time, and upon reasonable notice, but in no event not less than seven days prior notice, inspect and audit any and all books and records of the Franchisee relevant to the determination of gross revenues and the computation of franchise fees due for the previous five years, and may recompute any amounts determined to be payable under the franchise. The cost of the audit shall be borne by the Franchisee if, as a result of the audit, the City determines that the Franchisee has underpaid the franchise fees owned in an amount equal to or exceeding two percent of the franchise fees actually paid. A Franchisee shall make all books and records necessary to satisfactorily perform the audit readily available for inspection to the auditors in the City, or in the alternative, the Franchisee shall pay all costs necessary for the City to perform the audit at a location outside the City. 
(g)  In the event that a franchise fee payment is not received by the City on or before the due date set forth in subsection (b) above, or is underpaid, the Franchisee shall pay a late charge of 18 percent per annum of the amount of the unpaid or underpaid franchise fee payment, provided, however, that such rate does not exceed the maximum amount allowed under Florida law, and that the Franchisee shall not be responsible for paying interest on delinquent franchise fees resulting from erroneous database information provided by the City. Any interest and/or late charge paid by the Franchisee is intended to be a charge incidental to the enforcement of a franchise within the meaning of 47 U.S.C. § 542(g)(2)(D), and may not be deducted from the franchise fee imposed by this Article or any franchise agreement. Furthermore, the City may invoke all rights and remedies available under applicable law and this Article. 
(h)  When a franchise terminates for whatever reason, the Franchisee shall file with the City within 60 calendar days of the date its operations in the City of Casselberry cease, a financial statement, certified by a certified public accountant or the Franchisee's chief financial officer, showing the gross revenues received by the Franchisee since the end of the previous fiscal year. Adjustments shall be made at that time for franchise fees due to the date that the Franchisee's operations ceased. 
(i)  Any transaction or arrangement which has the effect of circumventing payment of franchise fees and/or evasion of payment of franchise fees (for example, by non-collection of revenues, non-reporting of revenues, collection of revenues by parents, affiliates or subsidiaries, bartering, or any other means) from the operation of the Franchisee's cable system to provide cable service in the City of Casselberry is strictly prohibited.

Such reports shall be certified by the corporate officer responsible for the preparation of the gross revenue report expressing an opinion thereon. At any other time, upon request of the City, the Franchisee shall submit any further information regarding the Franchisee's performance of the franchise agreement as may be required by the City. 
(3)  A summary of written subscriber or consumer complaints, or those complaints requiring a service call, identifying the number and nature of complaints and their disposition.

Alternatively, the annual ownership information required by the FCC for broadcast licensees may be supplied, or if a parent corporation's stock is publicly traded, a copy of its most recent annual report shall suffice. 
(6)  A copy of customer notifications provided under Section 48-49.

(b)  Within 30 days of a request by the City, a Franchisee shall make available to the City books and records adequate to enable the Franchisee to demonstrate that it is in compliance with the requirements of this Article and the franchise agreement. This provision shall not be deemed as a waiver of a Franchisee's right to assert that the information sought by the City is proprietary and should not be disclosed, and to withhold such information upon the agreement of the City. If the City Manager does not concur with such assertion, then the Franchisee may appeal such decision to the City Commission in accordance with applicable laws and procedures. If the City Commission finds the books and records should be disclosed, and if the Franchisee does not appeal such decision to a court of law, then the Franchisee shall promptly provide such documents, including the alleged proprietary portion thereof, to the City. The City shall maintain confidentiality of information provided by the Franchisee when Franchisee has designated such information as proprietary if legally possible. The City shall provide Franchisee with notice of any request by a third party for such information.

Sec. 48-42. - Discrimination prohibited. 
(a)  Unless approved by the City, or to the extent consistent with federal law, no Franchisee may in its rates or charges, or in the availability of the services or facilities of its system, or in any other respect, make or grant illegal preferences or advantages to any subscriber or potential subscriber to the system, or to any user or potential user of the system, nor subject any such persons to any illegal prejudice or any disadvantage; provided, however, a Franchisee may offer discounts in order to attract or maintain subscribers, so long as such discounts are offered on a legally non-discriminatory basis within the service area. A Franchisee must not deny, delay or otherwise burden service or discriminate against subscribers or users on the basis of age, race, creed, religion, color, sex, disability status, national origin, marital status, except for discounts for senior citizens or economically disadvantaged groups of subscribers that are applied in a uniform and consistent manner. 
(b)  A Franchisee must not deny cable service to any potential subscribers because of the income of the residents of the area in which the subscribers reside. 
(c)  Franchisee may offer services to commercial subscribers at rates different than those charged residential subscribers and may enter into separate contracts with multiple dwelling unit buildings. Franchisee may also charge different rates for services based upon single point billing or other contractual considerations.

(Ord. No. 02-1044, § 18, 3-25-02)

An application for approval of such a pro forma transfer shall clearly identify the application as such. 
(d)  The City Manager shall make recommendations to the Commission on each transfer application submitted to the Commission for final action. The Commission shall hold a public hearing before taking final action on an application for transfer of a franchise. 
(e)  In making a determination on whether to grant an application to transfer a franchise, the Commission will consider the legal, financial, technical and character qualifications of the transferee to operate the system and whether operation by the Franchisee would adversely affect the cable services to subscribers. The Franchisee will provide all information necessary to this determination. The transferee will take on all the obligations of the Franchisee under this Article and the Franchise Agreement. 
(f)  Approval by the City of a transfer of a franchise does not constitute a waiver or release of any of the rights of the City under this Article or a franchise agreement.

Sec. 48-47. - Minimum facilities and services. 
(a)  The following minimum requirements for facilities and services apply to all franchises, except where expressly specified in a franchise document. The City may require in a franchise agreement that a Franchisee exceed these minimum requirements where it determines, under circumstances existing at the time of the application, that the higher requirements are necessary to meet reasonable public needs, taking into account the costs thereof, and that such requirements are consistent with current state-of-the-art capabilities and are economically feasible: 
(1)  Any cable system construction occurring after the effective date of this Article shall have a minimum capacity of 78 video channels, available for immediate or potential use, and have the capability for two-way communications. 
(2)  Until its franchise is renewed, if at all, unless its franchise agreement expressly provides otherwise, a Franchisee existing as of March 11, 2002, shall make available, without charge, unlimited time on up to two channels, as follows: 
a.  The Seminole County government access channel for non-commercial governmental use. To the extent permitted by applicable law, a Franchisee shall be required to make this local government access channel available as part of its lowest basic service level. 
b.  At such time as Franchisee provides an educational access channel to its customers in unincorporated Seminole County, an educational access channel to be used by the Seminole County School Board for non-commercial local educational use. 
(3)  A Franchisee may be required to provide the most commonly provided service offering without charge to facilities within the City passed by the cable system which are owned or occupied by a local governmental entity for predominantly educational or governmental use. Such service shall be provided by means of a single drop extending to the facility or, in the event the facility consists of more than one building, to a single building within such facility selected by the governmental entity. The Franchisee shall not be required to extend such single drop more than 250 feet from the cable distribution line with the expense of any additional extension to be borne by the entity being served.

(5)  A Franchisee shall make available to its subscribers equipment capable of decoding closed circuit captioning information for the hearing impaired. A Franchisee may charge for such equipment. 
(b)  A Franchisee shall make cable service available to every dwelling within the City where the dwelling is in an area with a minimum density of 20 dwellings per cable mile as measured from the Franchisee's existing cable plant. Density per cable mile shall be computed by dividing the number of Residential Dwelling Units in the area by the length, in miles or fractions thereof, of the total amount of aerial or underground cable necessary to make service available to the Residential Dwelling Units in such area in accordance with Franchisee's system design parameters. The cable length shall be measured from the nearest technically feasible point of access to the then-existing system, which is located within the public rights-of-way. The total cable length shall exclude the drop cable necessary to serve individual Subscriber premises. Where potential subscribers reside in a portion of the service area with dwelling density below the prescribed minimum, the Franchisee shall extend service to such potential subscribers under the following conditions: (1) if they are willing to pay a one-time charge equivalent to the Franchisee's construction cost per dwelling in each cable mile area; or (2) if 15 potential subscribers per cable mile measured from the existing cable feeder plan commit themselves to taking service in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Franchisee.

Sec. 48-86. - Short title. 
    This Ordinance shall be known as the "Electric Distribution Franchise Ordinance". 
(Ord. No. 01-1011, § 1, 3-12-01) 
Sec. 48-87. - City commission findings and legislative intent. 
    The City Commission of the City of Casselberry hereby makes the following findings and declares its legislative intent as follows: 
(1)  There is an immediate and continuing need for safe and reliable electric service for individuals, organizations, firms, and entities located within in the City of Casselberry (the "City"). 
(2)  Section 166.021(1), Florida Statutes, provides municipalities broad authority, including the governmental, corporate and proprietary powers to enable them to conduct municipal government, perform municipal functions, and render municipal services. Pursuant to this broad home rule authority, the City may, in its sole discretion make safe, reliable and affordable electric service available to its citizens by means of the construction, operation and maintenance of power generation facilities and associated transmission and distribution systems in and on the roadways and associated easements and rights-of-way of the City and such electric service would provide an economic benefit to the City's inhabitants, property owners and businesses. 
(3)  The City holds the public rights-of-way within its boundaries in trust on behalf of its citizens and has a duty to utilize or permit others to utilize rights-of-way in an appropriate manner while insuring that the City properly manages its resources to the maximum reasonable economic benefit of its citizens. 
(4)  The City is the sole authority empowered to own, operate and maintain the City streets, easements and rights-of-way within the City and structures located thereon and to grant the use of such streets, easements and rights-of-ways to others. 
(5)  The City has a continuing duty pursuant to Article III, Section 8(d), Code of Ordinances for the City of Casselberry, to regulate the use of its rights-of-ways within the City's jurisdiction in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens living and working in the City. 
(6)  Article III, Section 8(e), Code of Ordinances for the City of Casselberry, contains the basic requirements for franchises from the City to any corporation, partnerships, or private individuals operating within the municipality. 
(7)  The City's powers, both governmental and proprietary, in regard to its rights-of-way have not been preempted by the Florida Legislature. 
(8)  The Florida appellate decision known as City of Oviedo v. Alafaya Utilities, Inc., 704 So. 2d 206 (Fla. 5 th DCA 1998) has construed Section 337.401(1), Florida Statutes, to allow cities to grant the use of their rights-of-way subject to such reasonable rules and regulations governing such use as any such city deems necessary or appropriate. 
(9)  The City is entitled to collect from franchisees a fee in return for a grant of property rights to franchisees, namely the use and occupation of the rights-of-way and public lands within the city for the construction, ownership, operation and maintenance of electric distribution lines and associated facilities. Alachua County v. State of Florida, 737 So. 2d 1065 (Fla. 1999); City of Plant City v. Mayo, 337 So. 2d 966 (Fla. 1976); Santa Rosa County v. Gulf Power Co., 635 So. 2d 96 (Fla. 1 st DCA 1994). 
(10)  In order to insure that any franchise fee to be assessed against or negotiated with any franchisee which is granted the authority to use and occupy the City's right-of-way hereunder is appropriate and reasonable, the City declares that it may consider the testimony and advice of experts as to what constitutes an appropriate, reasonable and market-rate franchise fee and will negotiate and determine franchise fees based on such testimony and advice and other relevant considerations. 
(11)  The City's police powers in regard to its rights-of-way and Public lands are not preempted by the Florida Public Service Commission. See § 366.11(2), Florida Statutes. 
(12)  The City may charge rent for use of its rights-of-way and public lands so long as the amount of the rental has a reasonable nexus with the rental value of the rights-of-way and public lands, as stated in Alachua County v. State, 737 So. 2d 1065 (Fla. 1999), City of Pensacola v. Southern Bell Telephone Co., 37 So. 820 (Fla. 1905), and City of St. Louis v. Western Union, 148 U.S. 92 (1893). 
(13)  The aesthetics of the City are adversely affected by the Franchisee's use and occupation of the City's rights-of-way and public lands. 
(14)  The City is limited in its use of its rights-of-way and public lands used and occupied by Franchisee, in that it cannot allow another utility to occupy that space, so long as the Franchisee remains in the rights-of-way and public lands. 
(15)  The occupation of the rights-of-way by the Franchisee results in higher costs when the City makes improvements to the rights-of-way. 
(16)  It is hereby declared a matter protecting the public health, safety and welfare from unsafe and unauthorized use of public property interests, benefitting the public health, safety and welfare and in the best interests of the City and its inhabitants, property owners and merchants, that the City make affordable, safe and reliable electric service available within the City. 
(17)  It being within the City's authority to do so, the City hereby establishes the reasonable conditions set forth below which shall be the minimum conditions under which any existing franchise to provide electric distribution service shall be governed upon the expiration of any such franchise and until the terms of a new franchise are agreed and under which any future franchises to provide electric distribution service within the City shall be granted by the City. 
(18)  The City hereby adopts this Ordinance pursuant to the power and authority granted to the City by Article VIII, Section 2, Florida Constitution Chapter 166, Florida Statutes. 
(19)  Due to the pervasive regulation of telecommunications by federal law, the City specifically makes these minimum franchise conditions inapplicable to any franchise relative to the provision of telecommunications service. 
(Ord. No. 01-1011, § 2, 3-12-01) 
Sec. 48-88. - Nature of franchise granted. 
    The City may grant any franchisee ("Franchisee") which the City finds capable of meeting the requirements of this Ordinance a non-exclusive right to construct, operate and maintain an electric distribution system ("Electric Distribution System") within the rights-of-way in the City. Any such franchise shall be provided by the City by means of a specific franchise ordinance which shall be negotiated at arms length with the intended Franchisee, and which shall at minimum, incorporate the terms and conditions contained herein and shall also contain additional terms and conditions consistent with the City's authority under Florida law which the City and Franchisee may negotiate (the "Electric Distribution Service Franchise"). Applicants for an Electric Distribution Service Franchise shall submit to the City written application on forms to be provided by the City. All such franchise applications when filed shall be available for public inspection at places designated by the City. No later than sixty days after the application is submitted, the first of two or more public hearings shall be held on the application. A decision shall be made by the City not later than 21 days after the conclusion of the last of such public hearings based upon an evaluation of the application, the hearings, and other information that the City may deem relevant. The applicant shall assume the cost of publication of any ordinance to grant a franchise, as such publication is required by law, and such is payable prior to final consideration of the request by the City commission. No person, firm, or entity may conduct business in the City's right-of-way unless it complies with the terms of this Ordinance unless said person, firm, or corporation was in place and operating prior to the grant of any franchise to that person, firm or corporation by the City. Grant of a franchise under this Ordinance shall create a vested right in the Franchisee for the term of the franchise, subject to state law and this Ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 01-1011, § 3, 3-12-01) 
Sec. 48-89. - Reservation of rights. 
    Nothing in this Ordinance or in any Electric Distribution Service Franchise shall be construed to prevent the City from constructing any public facility, grading, paving, repairing and/or altering any rights-of-way or easements. Whenever the City deems it necessary that Franchisee's Electric Distribution System and any rights-of-way or easements must be relocated, Franchisee shall relocate, support and protect that portion of the Electric Distribution System at Franchisee's sole cost. In such event, the City shall order the relocation in writing and provide Franchisee with adequate time to complete the relocation. The City agrees to cooperate with Franchisee in an effort to minimize interruption electric service and any relocation cost. The City hereby expressly reserves the following additional rights to: 
(1)  Exercise its governmental powers, now or hereafter, to the full extent that such powers may be vested in or granted to the City. 
(2)  Adopt, in addition to the provisions contained herein, in the Electric Distribution Service Franchise and in any existing ordinances, such additional reasonable regulations as it shall find necessary and appropriate in the exercise of its police powers. Nothing herein shall be construed as a waiver of the Franchisee's legal rights to timely contest the exercise or the validity of the exercise of the City's police powers. 
(3)  Renegotiate in good faith any Electric Distribution Service Franchise granted pursuant to this Ordinance should any material provision of this Ordinance or the Electric Distribution Service Franchise be declared unenforceable, illegal or invalid. 
(4)  The City shall have the right at any time during the life of an Electric Distribution Service Franchise granted herein to acquire by condemnation for any public purpose all or part of the Electric Distribution System, placed under this grant within the City's property, streets or rights-of-way, at a fair and just value, which shall not include any amount for the grant itself, or of any of the rights and privileges hereby granted, and this grant and franchise shall there upon terminate as to the portion so acquired by the City. 
(5)  The City specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, as many Electric Distribution Service Franchises as it deems appropriate; provided, however, that no such additional grant shall operate to materially modify, revoke or terminate any rights previously granted to any Franchisee. 
(6)  No provision of this Ordinance shall be deemed to bar the right of the City to seek or obtain judicial relief from a violation of any provisions of this Ordinance, an Electric Distribution Service Franchise or any rule, regulation, requirement or directive promulgated under this Ordinance, whether administratively, judicially or both. Neither the existence of other remedies identified in this Ordinance nor the exercise thereof shall be deemed to bar or otherwise limit the right of the City to recover fines, penalties or monetary damages for such violation by Franchisee or judicial enforcement of Franchisee's obligations by means of specific performance, injunctive relief or mandate or any other administrative remedy or judicial remedy at law or in equity. 
(Ord. No. 01-1011, § 4, 3-12-01) 
Sec. 48-90. - Term of franchise. 
    Any Electric Distribution Service Franchise shall have a fixed term not to exceed 30 years, commencing on the Effective Date thereof and ending on the agreed anniversary date thereafter ("Franchise Term"), unless terminated sooner in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance or the terms contained therein. 
(Ord. No. 01-1011, § 5, 3-12-01) 
Sec. 48-91. - Access to rights of way. 
    Franchisee or its designee shall be responsible for the cost associated with the design, construction and operation of the Electric Distribution System and any modifications thereto. The City shall provide Franchisee access to its rights-of-way within the City necessary to allow the timely construction, operation and maintenance of the Electric Distribution System as permitted in the applicable Electric Distribution Service Franchise. 
(Ord. No. 01-1011, § 6, 3-12-01) 
Sec. 48-92. - Conditions on use of rights of way. 
    The following shall constitute general conditions applicable to the placement of any Electric Distribution System within the City's streets, rights-of-way or property: 
(1)  Prior to the installation, placement or removal of any conduits, facilities, cables or pole lines, or the start of any other type of construction on the public rights-of-way, Franchisee shall, pursuant to the requirements of existing or subsequently enacted City ordinances, obtain all permits from, and pay all applicable fees to, the City's Department of Public Works. Such permits shall set out the place, date and time where the cables or pole lines, or other form of construction, are to be installed, or removed or where the construction is to be conducted. All permit applications submitted by Franchisee shall contain plans showing known utility facilities and specifications, and the proposed location of its conduits, cables, poles, lines and other associated facilities. No such permit shall create a vested property right in the Franchisee. Further, issuance of a permit by the City shall not be construed by Franchisee as a warranty that the placement by Franchisee of its Electric Distribution System is in compliance with any applicable rules, regulations or laws. 
(2)  Any type of construction by Franchisee shall be performed with the least possible interference with the use of the public rights-of-way and to adjoining property owners and in compliance with the rules and regulations of the State Department of Transportation and any other applicable governmental authority having jurisdiction. 
(3)  Any addition or improvement to the Electric Distribution System placed without first having obtained all applicable City permits shall be removed within 30 days' written notice by the City to remove the same and, in default of compliance with such notice, the conduits, cables or poles may be removed by order of the Department of Public Works of the City and the cost of removal shall be borne and paid by Franchisee, or in the event the City approves the placement of same after the fact, Franchisee shall obtain all requisite permits therefor and pay all applicable penalties and fees. 
(4)  Franchisee shall not in any way displace, damage or destroy any electric distribution system, sewer, water main, pipe or any other facilities belonging to the City, or to any third party who placed such facilities therein by express authority of the City, without the consent of the City, and Franchisee shall be liable to the City or to the third party owner, as the case may be, for the cost of any repairs made necessary by any such displacement, damage or destruction and shall pay such costs within 30 days of Franchisee's receipt of an invoice for same. 
(5)  Franchisee shall, at its own cost and expense, replace and repair without delay any sidewalk, public way, alley, highway, waterway, bridge or any other public place that has been excavated, broken, removed, displaced, or disarranged by Franchisee during the construction, maintenance and operation of any portion of the Electric Distribution System, or as a result of the deterioration of any portion of the Electric Distribution System, and restore the same to as good a condition as it existed prior to Franchisee commencing its work. Upon failure of Franchisee to do so after 30 days' written notice by the Director of Public Works of the City, the City may make such repairs and replacements as it deems reasonably necessary, and Franchisee shall pay the City upon demand all costs of such repairs and replacements. Franchisee shall, to the satisfaction of the Public Works Director, warrant any repairs it makes pursuant to this Section against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of one year following the date of such repair. 
(6)  Franchisee shall use all proper and reasonable care in connection with any work which it may do pursuant to an Electric Distribution Service Franchise in seeking to prevent harm, damage or injury to persons or property therefrom. 
(7)  The Franchisee shall not, and shall prohibit any officer, agent, employee, contractor or subcontractor which the Franchisee retains, from removing or substantially trimming any tree or major portion thereof, either above, at or below ground level, which is located within a public way without the prior written approval of the City. Each Franchisee shall be responsible for all damages arising from or resulting from the removal, trimming, mutilation of or any injury to any tree proximately caused by the Franchisee or its officers, agents, employees, contractors or subcontractors. 
(8)  Franchisee shall also keep all rights-of-way occupied by the Electric Distribution System free of excess debris. 
(Ord. No. 01-1011, § 7, 3-12-01) 
Sec. 48-93. - Standards for the electric distribution system. 
    The Electric Distribution System shall meet or exceed the standards and requirements established by the Florida Public Service Commission and must also comply with the following requirements: (a) the equipment used in the Electric Distribution System must be capable of operating in a safe and reliable manner as determined by the Florida Public Service Commission; (b) the Electric Distribution System must be constructed in a way which does not obstruct or otherwise make unusable any of the City streets or rights-of-way; (c) the Electric Distribution System shall be constructed in a manner consistent with all applicable laws of the State of Florida and of the United States as well as all applicable codes, standards and permit requirements. 
(Ord. No. 01-1011, § 8, 3-12-01) 
Sec. 48-94. - Franchise fees/audit rights. 
(a)  Franchise Fee Payment. As a consideration for the grant of any Electric Service Distribution Franchise, Franchisee shall pay to the City a franchise fee ("Franchise Fee") in the amount to be negotiated by Franchisee and the City based upon a reasonable percentage of the annual gross revenue of Franchisee from the sale of electric energy over the Electric Distribution System or any such other mutually agreeable methodology as the reasonable rental and use for such rights-of-way. The Franchise Fee provided for herein shall constitute the exclusive payment by Franchisee to the City for Franchisee's use and occupancy of the rights-of-way within the City's boundaries. For purposes of this Ordinance, a franchise fee of six percent shall be rebuttably presumed to be a reasonable franchise fee. The City may negotiate with Franchisee a Franchise Fee which is more or less than six percent in return for other value provided to the City through negotiations with Franchisee or based on other relevant considerations. 
(b)  Time of Payment. Within 30 calendar days after the close of each month, the Franchisee shall pay the franchise fee as provided in subsection (a) of this Section and file with the City's finance director a statement, signed and certified by an authorized accountant or financial representative of Franchisee, of the revenues derived in the preceding quarter. Acceptance of any franchise fee payment shall not be deemed a waiver or release of any claims the City may have for additional sums, nor be construed as an accord that the amount paid is correct. 
(c)  Documentation and Audit Rights. Accompanying each Franchise Fee payment, Franchisee shall prepare and provide all reasonable calculations and documentation necessary to support the Franchise Fee payment calculations. In the event the City disputes the amount of any Franchise Fee payment made, the City shall be entitled to perform or cause to be performed an independent audit of Franchisee's accounts with respect to revenues earned by Franchisee from the sale of electric energy over Electric Distribution System. The City shall provide Franchisee with 30 days' prior written notice of its intent to perform any such audit. Upon receipt of such notice, Franchisee shall make available the applicable documentation and records necessary to allow the City to perform the audit. 
(d)  Audit. The City may require an audit of Franchisee's books not more frequently than once each calendar year. Franchisee will reimburse City's audit costs if the audit identifies errors in the Franchisee's Franchise Revenues of five percent or more for the period audited that results in Franchisee having underpaid the Franchise Fee. Errors identified during the audit process shall be projected retrospectively for any additional time periods not covered during the audit if there is a reasonable probability these errors occurred during the unaudited period, but not for more than five years. If an underpayment of the Franchise Fee has occurred, interest will be computed at a rate of ten percent per annum from the date such underpayment was originally due. Both the underpayment and interest shall be paid within thirty days after receipt of demand therefor from City. 
(e)  Other Taxes. The sums of money to be paid by the Franchisee to the City under this section are compensation and consideration for the use by the Franchisee of the City's public ways for the construction, maintenance and operation of the Electric Distribution System and are not taxes as allowed by the Florida Constitution, the general or special laws of the state, or any other ordinances of the City. The Franchisee shall at all times continue to be subject to public service taxes (F.S. § 166.231), ad valorem taxes (F.S. § 166.211) and such other taxes, charges or fees as may be lawfully authorized by the Florida Constitution, the general or special laws of the state, the provisions of the Municipal Home Rule Powers Act (F.S. ch. 166) or the ordinances of the City.

Sec. 48-95. - Performance security. 
    Franchisee shall exercise none of the rights granted by permit, franchise or this Ordinance until evidence of compliance with the following bonding and preceding insurance requirements has been filed with the City of Casselberry, Florida.

Sec. 50-27. - Responsibility for condition of premises. 
(a)  The person responsible for the condition of any premises with regard to mosquito breeding sites is the person using or occupying the premises, or, in case no person is using or occupying the premises, the person who by law is entitled to the immediate possession of the premises. However, if the premises are used or occupied by two or more tenants of a common landlord or contain grounds appurtenant to a house occupied by two or more tenants of a common landlord, then the landlord is responsible, though each tenant is responsible for that part of the premises which he occupies to the exclusion of the other tenants. 
(b)  Where the premises are occupied by a tenant under a yearly or monthly tenancy or under a lease for not more than a year, or under any lease whereby the lessor is expressly or impliedly obligated to keep the premises in repair, and the collection of standing or flowing water in which mosquitoes breed or are likely to breed is due to the disrepair of the buildings, any natural quality of the premises, any condition that existed at the time when the tenant entered into possession, or anything done on the premises by the landlord during the existence of the tenancy or lease, then the landlord is the person responsible for such condition. 
(c)  Any person who has caused to exist on any premises of which he is not the owner, landlord, occupant or tenant any collection of water in which mosquitoes breed or are likely to breed is responsible for such condition, as well as the owner, landlord, tenant or occupant, as the case may be. 
(Code 1982, § 93.28(A)) 
Sec. 50-28. - Treatment of breeding places required; treatment methods. 
(a)  It shall be unlawful for any person to have, keep, maintain, cause or permit any collection of standing or flowing water in which mosquitoes breed or are likely to breed, unless the collection of water is treated so as effectually to prevent such breeding. Collections of water in which mosquitoes breed or are likely to breed are those contained in ditches, ponds, groundwater pools, swimming pools, pools, excavations, holes, depressions, open cesspools, privy vaults, fountains, cisterns, tanks, shallow wells, barrels, troughs, except horse troughs in frequent use, urns, cans, boxes, bottles, tubs, buckets, defective house roof gutters, tanks of flush closets, or other similar water containers. The natural presence of mosquito larvae in standing or running water shall be prima facie evidence that mosquitoes are breeding there. 
(b)  Collections of water in which mosquitoes breed or are likely to breed shall be treated by one or more of the following methods, as approved by the City: 
(1)  Screening with wire netting of at least 16 meshes to the inch each way, or any other material which will effectually prevent the ingress or egress of mosquitoes. 
(2)  Complete emptying every seven days of unscreened containers, together with thorough drying or cleaning. 
(3)  Using a larvicide approved and applied under the direction of the City. 
(4)  Completely covering the surface of the water with kerosene, petroleum or paraffin oil once every seven days. 
(5)  Cleaning and keeping sufficiently free of vegetable growth and other obstructions, and stocking with mosquito-destroying fish.

(Code 1982, § 93.26) 
Sec. 50-29. - Failure to treat breeding places; treatment by City. 
(a)  In case the person responsible for the condition of the premises on which mosquitoes breed or are likely to breed fails or refuses to take necessary measures to prevent their breeding within three days after written notice has been given him by the Code Enforcement Officer, or within a longer time as specified in the notice, but not to exceed five days, the person responsible shall be deemed guilty of a violation of this Article. For each day after the expiration of three days from the day on which the notice is given him, or for each day after the expiration of the time specified in the notice, as the case may be, that the person responsible fails or refuses to take measures, the person responsible shall be deemed guilty of a separate violation of this Article. 
(b)  In case of the failure or refusal of the person responsible, the City is authorized to take necessary measures to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes, and all necessary costs incurred by the City for that purpose shall be a charge against the person responsible.

Sec. 53-1. - Short title. 
    This Chapter shall be known and may be cited as "Impact Fees." 
(Ord. No. 13-1393, § III, 8-12-13) 
Sec. 53-2. - Findings of fact, purpose and intent of ordinance. 
    It is hereby ascertained, determined and declared that: 
A.  Both existing development and development necessitated by the growth contemplated in the comprehensive plan will require improvements and additions to the multi-modal transportation system, the city park system, law enforcement facilities, and fire and rescue facilities of the City to accommodate and maintain existing level of service standards. 
B.  Future growth represented by capital improvement impact projects should contribute its fair share of the cost of capacity-adding improvements and additions to the multi-modal transportation system, the city park system, law enforcement facilities, and fire and rescue facilities required to accommodate capital improvement demands generated by such growth as adopted in the comprehensive plan. 
C.  Implementation of a reasonable impact fee structure to require future capital improvement impact projects to contribute their fair share of the cost of required new capital improvement capacity is an integral and vital element of the regulatory plan of growth management incorporated in the comprehensive plan. 
D.  The projected capital improvements and additions to the capital improvement system of the City and the allocation of projected costs between those necessary to serve existing development and those required to accommodate new capital improvement impact projects, as presented in the study entitled "Impact Fee Study," were approved and adopted via Resolution 13-2482 by the City Commission on April 8, 2013, and such projections are found to be in conformity with the comprehensive plan. 
E.  Capital improvement planning is an evolving process, and the capital improvements and additions to the multi-modal transportation system, the city park system, law enforcement facilities, and fire and rescue facilities identified upon the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived constitute projections of growth patterns and improvements and additions based upon present knowledge and judgment. Therefore, in recognition of changing growth patterns and the dynamic nature of population growth, it is the intent of the City Commission that the identified improvements and additions to the capital improvement system be reviewed and adjusted periodically to ensure that impact fees are imposed equitably and lawfully and are utilized effectively based upon actual and anticipated conditions at the time of their imposition. 
F.  The purpose of this chapter is to require payment of citywide impact fees by new capital improvement impact projects and to provide for the cost of capital improvements to the city's capital improvement system, which are required to accommodate the additional demand caused by such capital improvement impact projects. This chapter shall not be construed to permit the collection of impact fees from capital improvement impact projects in excess of the amount reasonably anticipated to offset the demand new growth will have on the City's capital improvement systems.

(Ord. No. 13-1393, § III, 8-12-13) 
Sec. 53-6. - Calculation generally; impact fee statement. 
    An impact fee statement shall be calculated and issued as provided in Section 53-12. 
(Ord. No. 13-1393, § III, 8-12-13) 
Sec. 53-7. - Alternative fee; calculation. 
A.  If an applicant believes that the impact to the multi-modal transportation system, the city park system, law enforcement facilities, or fire and rescue facilities caused by the applicant's proposed capital improvement impact project is less than the fee established in Section 53-5 or Section 53-17, the applicant may, at his or her own expense, prior to issuance of a building permit for such capital improvement impact project, submit a calculation of an alternative impact fee to the City Engineer pursuant to the provisions of this Section. The City Engineer shall make a determination within ten business days of submittal as to whether that calculation complies with the requirements of this Section. 
B.  For purposes of any alternative impact fee calculation, the capital improvement impact project shall be presumed to have the maximum impact on the capital improvement system for the land use category contemplated under the impact fee rate. 
C.  If an applicant decides to perform an alternative impact fee study, the methodology for said study shall be approved by the City Engineer, based on the methodology adopted by the City Commission in the impact fee study, before the applicant begins the study. 
D.  An alternative impact fee shall be calculated by use of the formula and methodologies used in the impact fee study. 
E.  The alternative impact fee calculations shall be based on data, information or assumptions contained in this chapter or independent sources, provided that: 
(1)  The independent source is a City-accepted source of engineering or planning information; or 
(2)  The independent source is a local study supported by a database adequate for the conclusions contained in that study, performed by a professional engineer or planner, pursuant to a generally accepted methodology of planning or engineering; or 
(3)  If a previously approved capital improvement impact project submitted a traffic impact study during its approval process, which is substantially consistent with the criteria required by this Section, and if that study is determined by the City Engineer to be current, the impact of that previously approved capital improvement impact project shall be presumed for the proposed capital improvement impact project to be as described in the prior study. In such circumstances, an alternative impact fee shall be established reflecting the capital improvement impacts described in the prior study. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that an alternative impact fee study conducted more than two years earlier is invalid. 
(4)  It is acknowledged that the multi-modal impact fee rates are based upon the applicable trip generation rates for the land use set forth in the multi-modal transportation impact fee rate schedule. In recognition of such acknowledgment, the trip generation rate for the land use categories shall be considered an independent source for the purposes of the calculation of an alternative impact fee calculation without the necessity of a study as required by Subsection (E)(2) of this Section. 
F.  If the City Engineer determines that the data, information and assumptions utilized by the applicant to calculate the alternative impact fee comply with the requirements of this Section, the alternative impact fee shall be paid in lieu of the fee set forth in Section 53-5. 
G.  If the City Engineer determines that the data, information and assumptions utilized by the applicant to calculate the alternative impact fee do not comply with the requirements of this Section, then the City shall provide to the applicant by certified mail, return receipt requested, written notification of the rejection of the alternative citywide impact fee, and the reason. The applicant shall have 15 calendar days from the receipt of the written notification of rejection to request a review hearing pursuant to Section 53-15. 
H.  The City Engineer or designee may conduct a follow up review to confirm the approved assumptions in the alternative impact fee calculation study within five years of acceptance of the study by the City. Impact fees attributable to any impacts shown to exist in the follow up review, but which were not previously accounted for in the alternative impact fee study, shall be paid by the then current property owner within 30 days of a demand letter issued by the City to the then current property owner. A fee may be collected by the City for this monitoring study at the time the alternative impact fee is paid, based only on actual costs incurred by the City. 
(Ord. No. 13-1393, § III, 8-12-13) 
Sec. 53-8. - Use of funds; refunds; audits.

D.  Funds on deposit in an impact fee trust account shall not be used for any expenditure that would be classified as a maintenance, operation, or repair expense or to cure an existing deficiency in the capital improvement system. 
E.  The monies deposited into an impact fee trust account shall be used solely to provide additional capital improvement capacity to the city's capital improvement system required to accommodate new capital improvement impact projects, as provided in the City's Five Year Capital Improvement Plan or Capital Improvements Element of the adopted Comprehensive Plan, as applicable. 
F.  Any monies on deposit which are not immediately necessary for expenditure shall be invested in interest bearing accounts by the City. All interest income derived from such investments shall remain or be deposited in the impact fee trust account on which the interest income was earned. 
G.  The impact fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be returned to the current owner of the property on behalf of which such fee was paid if such fees have not been expended or encumbered prior to the end of the fiscal year immediately following the seventh anniversary of the date upon which such fees were paid. Refunds shall be made only in accordance with the following procedure: 
(1)  The current owner shall petition the City Commission for the refund within one year following the end of the fiscal year in which occurs the date of the seventh anniversary of the payment of the impact fee by the original capital improvement impact project. 
(2)  The petition for refund shall be submitted to the City Engineer and shall contain: 
a.  A notarized sworn statement that the petitioner is the then current owner of the property on behalf of which the impact fee was paid;

d.  A copy of the most recent ad valorem tax bill. 
(3)  Within three months from the date of receipt of a petition for refund, the City Engineer will advise the petitioner and the City Commission of the status of the impact fee refund request, and, whether the impact fee paid has been spent or encumbered within the applicable time period. If it was not, the fees shall be returned to the petitioner with interest at the average net interest rate earned by the City in the applicable impact fee trust account during the time such impact fee was on deposit. For the purposes of this Section, fees collected are deemed to be spent or encumbered on the following basis: The first fee in shall be the first fee out. 
H.  Audits of the City's financial statements, which are performed by a certified public accountant pursuant to F.S. § 218.39 and submitted to the Auditor General, must include an affidavit signed by the City's Finance Director, stating that the City has complied with the requirements F.S. § 163.31801. 
(Ord. No. 13-1393, § III, 8-12-13) 
Sec. 53-9. - Exemptions. 
    The following shall be exempted from payment of impact fees: 
(1)  Alteration, expansion or replacement of an existing dwelling unit which does not increase the number of families which that dwelling unit is arranged, designed, or intended to accommodate for the purpose of providing living quarters.

(3)  Replacement of a building or the construction of an accessory building if the replacement building or accessory building does not result in a land use generating greater demand for the applicable category of capital improvement than was assumed in the impact fee study and reflected under the applicable impact fee rate. 
(4)  Construction of publicly owned projects. 
(5)  Temporary construction sheds or trailers erected to assist in construction and maintained during the term of a building permit. 
(Ord. No. 13-1393, § III, 8-12-13) 
Sec. 53-10. - Changes in use. 
    Impact fees shall be imposed and calculated on any or all of the applicable below listed conditions for the alteration, expansion or replacement of a building or dwelling unit or the construction of an accessory building if the alteration, expansion, or replacement of the building or dwelling unit or the construction of an accessory building results in a land use determined to generate greater impacts on the City's capital improvement systems than the present use under the applicable impact fee rate. The impact fee imposed under the applicable impact fee rate shall be calculated as follows: 
A.  When there is a change in land use, the impact fees imposed shall be the impact fees due under the applicable impact fee rate for the impact fee land use category resulting from the land use change less the impact fee that would be imposed under the applicable impact fee rate for the impact fee land use category prior to the land use change. 
B.  Unless exempt by Section 53-9, when the square footage of a building is increased, the impact fee rate shall be calculated based only on the increased square footage. 
C.  Unless exempt by Section 53-9, the impact fee imposed for any accessory buildings shall be that applicable under the impact fee rate for the land use for the primary building. 
(Ord. No. 13-1393, § III, 8-12-13) 
Sec. 53-11. - Vested rights. 
A.  Any owner which was the subject of a development order of the City prior to August 21, 2013, may petition the City Commission for a vested rights determination which, if approved, would exempt the owner from the provisions of this chapter. The petition shall be evaluated by the City Attorney and a determination thereon submitted to the City Commission based on the following criteria: 
1.  The existence of a valid unexpired governmental act of the City authorizing the specific development for which a determination is sought; 
2.  Expenditures or obligations made or incurred in reliance upon the authorizing governmental act that are reasonably equivalent to the fees required by this chapter; 
3.  Other factors that demonstrate that it is inequitable to deny the owner the opportunity to complete the previously approved development under the conditions of approval by requiring the owner to comply with the requirements of this chapter. For the purposes of this subsection, the following factors shall be considered in determining whether it is inequitable to deny the owner the opportunity to complete the previously approved development without having to comply with this chapter: 
a.  Whether the injury suffered by the owner outweighs the public cost of allowing the development to go forward without payment of the impact fees required by this chapter; and 
b.  Whether the expenses or obligations for the development were made or incurred subsequent or prior to February 15, 1988, the date of adoption of the original ordinance from which this chapter is derived. 
B.  The City Attorney shall make a written determination, subject to the approval of the City Commission, as to whether the owner has a vested right, and, if so, whether that vested right would exempt the owner from the provisions of this chapter. 
C.  Any written agreement entered into prior to the effective date of this chapter, or any amendments thereto, between the owner of any property and the City, which expressly establishes, restricts or prohibits the imposition of impact fees by the City, shall be binding upon the City and not subject to the provisions of this chapter. However, if such written agreement is amended to increase the amount of capital improvement impact project construction permitted on the property, then such additional capital improvement impact project construction shall be required to pay the impact fee as provided by this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 13-1393, § III, 8-12-13) 
Sec. 53-12. - Payment. 
A.  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no person shall carry out any capital improvement impact project unless the appropriate impact fee as set forth in Section 53-5 or 53-7 was paid at the time of issuance of the building permit for the capital improvement impact project. 
B.  Each capital improvement impact project shall be categorized by the City Engineer according to the land use categories set forth in Section53-5. The City Engineer will categorize a proposed capital improvement impact project based on the meanings assumed in the impact fee study, the definitions in Section 5.21.2 of the Unified Land Development Regulations, the Land-Based Classification Standards, (published by the APA), or other generally-accepted source. If a proposed use is not specifically listed and is determined by the City Engineer not to fit into any listed land use category in Section 53-5, the provisions of Section 53-28 of this chapter apply. 
C.  All impact fees required by this chapter shall be paid directly to the City. 
D.  If the impact fee rate for a particular capital improvement impact project is changed subsequent to the issuance of an impact fee statement, the impact fee rate calculated in the issued impact fee statement shall be the impact fee imposed for that capital improvement impact project. 
E.  The payment of impact fees shall be in addition to any other fees, charges or assessments due for the issuance of a building permit, except as expressly provided otherwise by the City Code of Ordinances. 
F.  The obligation for payment of impact fee shall run with the land. 
(Ord. No. 13-1393, § III, 8-12-13) 
Sec. 53-13. - Collection of unpaid fees; delinquency. 
    If the impact fee is not paid prior to the issuance of a building permit for the affected capital improvement impact project because of mistake or inadvertence on the part of the City, the City shall proceed to collect the impact fees as follows: 
A.  The City shall serve, by certified mail, return receipt requested, an impact fee statement notice upon the applicant at the address set forth in the application for the building permit, and on the owner at the address appearing on the most recent records maintained by the county property appraiser. Service of the impact fee statement notice shall be deemed notice of the impact fees due, and service shall be deemed effective on the date the return receipt indicates the notice was received by either the applicant or the owner, or the date the notice was attached to the building permit, whichever occurs first. The impact fee statement notice shall contain the legal description of the property, and shall advise the applicant and the owner as follows: 
1.  Of the amount due and the general purpose for which the impact fee was imposed; 
2.  That a hearing pursuant to Section 53-15 may be requested within 20 calendar days from the date of receipt of the impact fee statement notice, by making application to the Department of Community Development; 
3.  That the impact fee shall be delinquent if not paid and received by the City within 30 calendar days of the date the impact fee statement notice is received, excluding the date of receipt; or if a hearing is not requested pursuant to Section 53-15, upon becoming delinquent, shall be subject to the imposition of a delinquent fee and interest on the unpaid amount until paid; 
4.  That, if the impact fee becomes delinquent, a lien against the property for which the building permit was secured shall be recorded in the official record book of Seminole County. 
B.  The impact fee shall be delinquent if, within 30 calendar days from the date of the receipt of the impact fee statement notice by either the applicant or the owner, or the date the notice was attached to the building permit, neither the impact fees have been paid and received by the City, nor has a hearing been requested pursuant to Section 53-15. If a hearing is requested pursuant to Section 53-15, the impact fees shall become delinquent if not paid within 30 calendar days from the date the City Commission determines the amount of impact fees due upon the conclusion of such hearing. These time periods shall be calculated on a calendar day basis, including Sundays and legal holidays, but excluding the date of the earliest receipt of the impact fee statement notice, or the hearing date in the event of an appeal. If the last day falls on a Sunday or legal holiday, the last due date prior to becoming delinquent shall be the next business day. Upon becoming delinquent, a delinquency fee equal to ten percent of the total impact fees imposed shall be assessed. Such total impact fees, plus a delinquency fee, shall bear interest at the statutory rate for final judgments, calculated on a calendar day basis, until paid. 
C.  Should the impact fee become delinquent as set forth in Subsection B of this Section, the City shall serve, by certified mail, return receipt requested, a notice of lien upon the delinquent applicant, if the building is under construction, at the address indicated in the application for the building permit, and upon the delinquent owner at the address appearing on the most recent records maintained by the county property appraiser. The notice of lien shall notify the delinquent applicant and owner that, due to their failure to pay the impact fees, the City shall file a claim of lien with the clerk of the circuit court. 
D.  Upon mailing of the notice of lien, the City shall file a claim of lien with the clerk of the circuit court for recording in the official records of the county. The claim of lien shall contain the legal description of the property, and the amount of the delinquent impact fees and the date of their imposition. Once recorded, the claim of lien shall constitute a lien against the property described therein. The City Attorney shall proceed expeditiously to collect or otherwise enforce the lien, if authorized to proceed by the City Commission. 
E.  After the expiration of one year from the date of recording of the claim of lien, as provided in this Section, a suit may be filed to foreclose the lien. The foreclosure proceedings shall be instituted, conducted and enforced in conformity with the procedures for the foreclosure of municipal special assessment liens, as set forth in F.S. §§ 173.04-173.12, inclusive, which provisions are incorporated in this Section in their entirety to the same extent as if those provisions were set forth in this Section verbatim. 
F.  The collection and enforcement procedures set forth in this Section shall be cumulative with, supplemental and in addition to any applicable procedures provided in any other ordinances or administrative regulations of the City, or any applicable law or administrative regulation of the state. Failure of the City to follow the procedure set forth in this Section shall not constitute a waiver of its rights to proceed under any other ordinances or administrative regulations of the City or any applicable law or administrative regulation of the state. 
(Ord. No. 13-1393, § III, 8-12-13) 
Sec. 53-14. - Developer contribution credits.

Such land donation and construction of off-site improvement shall be subject to the following standards: 
1.  The donated land shall be an integral part of and a necessary accommodation of the contemplated offsite improvements to the category of capital improvement system included in the City's Five Year Capital Improvement Plan or Capital Improvements Element of the adopted Comprehensive Plan, as applicable. 
2.  The offsite improvements to be constructed shall be an integral part of and a necessary accommodation of the contemplated offsite improvements to the category of capital improvement system included in the City's Five Year Capital Improvement Plan or Capital Improvements Element of the adopted Comprehensive Plan, as applicable. 
B.  The amount of developer contribution credit to be applied shall be determined according to the following standards of valuation: 
1.  The value of donated land shall be based upon a written appraisal of fair market value by an M.A.I. appraiser, selected and paid for by the applicant, based upon comparable sales of similar property between unrelated parties utilizing accepted right-of-way appraisal techniques. If the appraisal does not conform to the requirements of this Section, the appraisal shall be corrected and resubmitted. If the City disagrees with the appraised value, the City may engage another appraiser and the value of the land donation shall be an amount equal to the average of the two appraisals; and 
2.  The cost of anticipated construction of offsite improvements to a category of the capital improvement system shall be based upon cost estimates certified by a registered professional engineer and approved by the City; and 
3.  The land and construction contributions shall receive credits under this Section, only for capacity adding capital improvements to the applicable category of the capital improvements system, in order to accommodate capital improvement impact projects, consistent with the impact fee study and the City's Five Year Capital Improvement Plan or Capital Improvements Element of the adopted Comprehensive Plan, as applicable; and 
C.  Prior to issuance of a building permit, the applicant shall submit to the City Engineer a proposed plan of construction of offsite improvements for the applicable category of the capital improvements system. The proposed plan of construction shall include:

2.  If the proposed donation and construction by the applicant is consistent with the public interest; and 
3.  If the proposed construction time schedule is consistent with the City capital improvements work schedule. 
    Upon receipt of a proposed plan of construction, the City Engineer shall determine the amount of construction credit based upon the standards of valuation set out in this Section, and shall approve a timetable for completion of construction. 
E.  All construction cost estimates shall be based upon, and all construction plans and specifications shall be in conformity with, the construction standards of the City. All plans and specifications shall be approved by the City Engineer prior to commencement of construction. 
F.  Any applicant shall have a right of review, pursuant to Section 53-15, of the determinations and certifications of a proposed plan of construction and the determination and valuation of the developer contribution credit by the City Engineer. 
G.  If the amount of developer contribution credit for a category of capital improvement system impact fees, as determined by the City Engineer, exceeds the total amount of impact fees due by the applicant, the City shall execute with the applicant an agreement for future reimbursement of the excess of such construction credit from future receipts by the City of impact fees for that category of fee only. Such agreement for reimbursement shall not be for a period in excess of ten years from the date of completion of the approved plan of construction, and shall provide for a forfeiture of any remaining reimbursement balance at the end of such ten-year period. 
H.  A credit shall not be awarded for any contribution of land, money, or services not made directly by the applicant, including a contribution or grant made by another entity. 
I.  Nothing contained in this Section shall be interpreted or construed to qualify any land required as right-of-way under the City's land development regulations, or required by the county or the state, as donated land under this Section. 
(Ord. No. 13-1393, § III, 8-12-13)

Dexterhouse, 348 So. 2d 916 (Fla. 2nd DCA 1977)), and as such is protected by the United States Constitution or Florida Constitution, or (ii) it is otherwise protected by the United States Constitution or Florida Constitution. 
(3)  A mother's breastfeeding of her baby does not under any circumstance violate the provisions of this Section.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 17-462, § 3, adopted July 24, 2017, repealed the former Ch. 60, §§ 60-1-60-23, and enacted a new Ch. 60 as set out herein. The former Ch. 60 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 06-1189, § 1(Exh. 1), 8-28-06; Ord. No. 11-1358, § 4, 9-12-11. 

Sec. 60-1. - Applicability of chapter. 
    The provisions of this chapter shall govern the use of city-owned parks and recreational areas and the facilities located therein. 
(Ord. No. 17-1462, § 3, 7-24-17) 
Sec. 60-2. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    City park means any land owned and maintained by the City of Casselberry for recreational use, whether passive or active, and designated as a "City Park" by a resolution, or any land which has been dedicated for use as a City Park developed or undeveloped, which has been accepted by the City Commission. Included in the definition of the term "City Park" are all natural resources, wildlife, facilities, improvements, waters and materials in, on or under the lands so designated. Properties in any system of trails owned by the City are intended to be designated as a City Park. Due to the diversity of City Parks and available park facilities, all City Parks shall be classified as either active recreation, passive recreation, special use, or golf club: 
(1)  Active recreation park. Those parks which have structured recreational activities for teams or individuals, or which provide active facility sites for non-organized leisure play, requiring specialized parkland development and management which may restrict general use of the park or facility. Active recreation is generally any recreational activity that requires significant infrastructure for the purposes of active sports or organized events. Active recreation involving team sports or organized events, typically involves intensive management, maintenance, and therefore higher costs, due to the need to provide substantial space to congregate. 
Examples of active recreation activities: 
  Sports fields 
  Ball fields 
  Playgrounds and play areas 
  Swimming pools 
  Tennis 
  Racquetball 
Active recreation parks: Dew Drop, Sunnytown, Lake Hodge, Branch Tree, Plumosa Oaks, Casselberry Greenway Trail 
(2)  Passive recreation park. Those parks which do not have organized, scheduled recreational activities, but include low intensity recreational activities requiring little or no specialized parkland development and management, and therefore can be provided at a low cost to communities. A passive recreation park is generally an undeveloped space or environmentally sensitive area that requires minimal development. Emphasis is placed on preservation of wildlife and the environment. Passive park use involves casual activities and pursuit of hobbies, with no adverse impact to the natural habitat. Passive recreation parks are enjoyed on a first-come, first-served basis, and only minimal visitor facilities and services are available. 
Examples of passive recreation activities: 
  Walking and jogging 
  Hiking and nature walks 
  Frisbee 
  Painting 
  Photography 
  Fishing 
  Rustic picnic areas 
  Canoeing

    In the event a Member dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing USERRA Qualified Military Service, the beneficiaries of the Member are entitled to any benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) as if the Member had resumed employment and then died while employed.

This provision shall be applied to all similarly situated individuals in a reasonably equivalent manner.

However, payments for overtime in excess of 300 hours per fiscal year or accrued unused sick or annual leave accrued as of the effective date and attributable to service earned prior to the effective date, may still be included in Salary for pension purposes even if the payment is not actually made until on or after the effective date. With respect to unused sick leave and unused annual leave accrued prior to the effective date, Salary will include the amount of sick or annual leave time accrued on the effective date or the actual amount of sick or annual leave time for which the retiree receives payment at the time of retirement, whichever is less. Overtime earned as part of the Members' regularly scheduled hours of work (also known as "built-in" or "FLSA" overtime) will not count towards the 300-hour annual overtime cap and will be considered pensionable earnings. Members who have reached age 55 and completed six or more years of credited service, or completed 25 years of credited service, regardless of age on September 15, 2013, shall not be subject to the above 300-hour limitation on overtime.

If the compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a Member's contributions or benefits for the current Plan Year, the compensation for such prior determination period is subject to the applicable annual compensation limit in effect for that prior period. The limitation on compensation for an "eligible employee" shall not be less than the amount which was allowed to be taken into account hereunder as in effect on July 1, 1993. "Eligible employee" is an individual who was a Member before the first Plan Year beginning after December 31, 1995.

(a)  As part of the System, there exists the Fund, into which shall be deposited all of the contributions and assets whatsoever attributable to the System. 
(b)  The actual custody and supervision of the Fund (and assets thereof) shall be vested in the Board. Payment of benefits and disbursements from the Fund shall be made by the disbursing agent but only upon written authorization from the Board. 
(c)  All funds of the Police Officers' and Firefighters' Pension Plan may be deposited by the Board with the Finance Director of the City, acting in a ministerial capacity only, who shall be liable in the same manner and to the same extent as he is liable for the safekeeping of funds for the City. However, any funds so deposited with the Finance Director of the City shall be kept in a separate fund by the Finance Director or clearly identified as such funds of the Police Officers' and Firefighters' Pension Plan. In lieu thereof, the Board shall deposit the funds of the Police Officers' and Firefighters' Pension Plan in a qualified public depository as defined in F.S. § 280.02, which depository with regard to such funds shall conform to and be bound by all of the provisions of Chapter 280, Florida Statutes. In order to fulfill its investment responsibilities as set forth herein, the Board may retain the services of a custodian bank, an investment advisor registered under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 or otherwise exempt from such required registration, an insurance company, or a combination of these, for the purposes of investment decisions and management. Such investment manager shall have discretion, subject to any guidelines as prescribed by the Board, in the investment of all Fund assets. 
(d)  All funds and securities of the System may be commingled in the Fund, provided that accurate records are maintained at all times reflecting the financial composition of the Fund, including accurate current accounts and entries as regards the following: 
(1)  Current amounts of Accumulated Contributions of Members on both an individual and aggregate account basis, and 
(2)  Receipts and disbursements, and 
(3)  Benefit payments, and 
(4)  Current amounts clearly reflecting all monies, funds and assets whatsoever attributable to contributions and deposits from the City or County, and 
(5)  All interest, dividends and gains (or losses) whatsoever, and 
(6)  Such other entries as may be properly required so as to reflect a clear and complete financial report of the Fund. 
(e)  An audit shall be performed annually by a certified public accountant for the most recent fiscal year of the System showing a detailed listing of assets and a statement of all income and disbursements during the year. Such income and disbursements must be reconciled with the assets at the beginning and end of the year. Such report shall reflect a complete evaluation of assets on both a cost and market basis, as well as other items normally included in a certified audit. 
(f)  The Board shall have the following investment powers and authority: 
(1)  The Board shall be vested with full legal title to said Fund, subject, however, and in any event to the authority and power of the Casselberry City Commission to amend or terminate this Fund, provided that no amendment or Fund termination shall ever result in the use of any assets of this Fund except for the payment of regular expenses and benefits under this System, except as otherwise provided herein. All contributions from time to time paid into the Fund, and the income thereof, without distinction between principal and income, shall be held and administered by the Board or its agent in the Fund and the Board shall not be required to segregate or invest separately any portion of the Fund. 
(2)  All monies paid into or held in the Fund shall be invested and reinvested by the Board and the investment of all or any part of such funds shall be subject to the following: 
a.  Notwithstanding any limitation provided for in F.S. Ch. 175 and 185, to the contrary (unless such limitation may not be amended by local ordinance) or any limitation in prior City ordinances to the contrary, all monies paid into or held in the Fund may be invested and reinvested in such securities, investment vehicles or property wherever situated and of whatever kind, as shall be approved by the Board, including but not limited to common or preferred stocks, bonds, and other evidences of indebtedness or ownership. In no event, however, shall more than 25 percent of the assets of the fund at market value be invested in foreign securities. 
b.  The Board shall develop and adopt a written investment policy statement setting forth permissible types of investments, goals and objectives of investments and setting quality and quantity limitations on investments in accordance with the recommendations of its investment consultants. The investment policy statement shall be reviewed by the Board at least annually. 
c.  In addition, the Board may, upon recommendation by the board's investment consultant, make investments in group trusts meeting the requirements of Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 81-100, Revenue Ruling 2011-1, IRS Notice 2012-6 and Revenue Ruling 2014-24 or successor rulings or guidance of similar import, and operated or maintained exclusively for the commingling and collective investment of monies, provided that the funds in the group trust consist exclusively of trust assets held under plans qualified under section 401(a) of the code, individual retirement accounts that are exempt under section 408(e) of the code, eligible governmental plans that meet the requirements of section 457(b) of the code, and governmental plans under 401(a)(24) of the code. For this purpose, a trust includes a custodial account or a separate tax favored account maintained by an insurance company that is treated as a trust under section 401(f) or under section 457(g)(3) of the code, While any portion of the assets of the fund are invested in such a group trust, such group trust is itself adopted as a part of the system or plan. 
1.  Any collective or common group trust to which assets of the fund are transferred pursuant to subsection c. shall be adopted by the Board as part of the plan by executing appropriate participation, adoption agreements, and/or trust agreements with the group trust's trustee. 
2.  The separate account maintained by the group trust for the plan pursuant to subsection c. shall not be used for, or diverted to, any purpose other than for the exclusive benefit of the Members and Beneficiaries of the plan. 
3.  For purposes of valuation, the value of the separate account maintained by the group trust for the plan shall be the fair market value of the portion of the group trust held for the plan, determined in accordance with generally recognized valuation procedures. 
(3)  At least once every three years, and more often as determined by the Board, the Board shall retain a professionally qualified independent consultant, as defined in F.S. §§ 175.071 and 185.06, to evaluate the performance of all current investment managers and make recommendations regarding the retention of all such investment managers. These recommendations shall be considered by the Board at its next regularly scheduled meeting. 
(4)  The Board may retain in cash and keep unproductive of income such amount of the Fund as it may deem advisable, having regard for the cash requirements of the System. 
(5)  Neither the Board nor any Trustee shall be liable for the making, retention or sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of the Fund, except that due to his or its own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. 
(6)  The Board may cause any investment in securities held by it to be registered in or transferred into its name as Trustee or into the name of such nominee as it may direct, or it may retain them unregistered and in form permitting transferability, but the books and records shall at all times show that all investments are part of the Fund. 
(7)  The Board is empowered, but is not required, to vote upon any stocks, bonds, or securities of any corporation, association, or trust and to give general or specific proxies or powers of attorney with or without power of substitution; to participate in mergers, reorganizations, recapitalizations, consolidations, and similar transactions with respect to such securities; to deposit such stock or other securities in any voting trust or any protective or like committee with the Trustees or with depositories designated thereby; to amortize or fail to amortize any part or all of the premium or discount resulting from the acquisition or disposition of assets; and generally to exercise any of the powers of an owner with respect to stocks, bonds, or other investments comprising the Fund which it may deem to be to the best interest of the Fund to exercise. 
(8)  The Board shall not be required to make any inventory or appraisal or report to any court, nor to secure any order of court for the exercise of any power contained herein. 
(9)  Where any action which the Board is required to take or any duty or function which it is required to perform either under the terms herein or under the general law applicable to it as Trustee under this article, can reasonably be taken or performed only after receipt by it from a Member, the City, or any other entity, of specific information, certification, direction or instructions, the Board shall be free of liability in failing to take such action or perform such duty or function until such information, certification, direction or instruction has been received by it. 
(10)  Any overpayments or underpayments from the Fund to a Member, Retiree or Beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate per annum approved by the Board in such a manner that the Actuarial Equivalent of the benefit to which the Member, Retiree or Beneficiary was correctly entitled, shall be paid. Overpayments shall be charged against payments next succeeding the correction or collected in another manner if prudent. Underpayments shall be made up from the Fund in a prudent manner. 
(11)  The Board shall sustain no liability whatsoever for the sufficiency of the Fund to meet the payments and benefits provided for herein. 
(12)  In any application to or proceeding or action in the courts, only the Board shall be a necessary party, and no Member or other person having an interest in the Fund shall be entitled to any notice or service of process. Any judgment entered in such a proceeding or action shall be conclusive upon all persons. 
(13)  Any of the foregoing powers and functions reposed in the Board may be performed or carried out by the Board through duly authorized agents, provided that the Board at all times maintains continuous supervision over the acts of any such agent; provided further, that legal title to said Fund shall always remain in the Board.

(a)  Member contributions. 
(1)  Amount. 
a.  Police Officer Members. Effective September 15, 2013, each Member of the System shall be required to make regular contributions to the Fund in the amount of three percent of his Salary. However, if the benefit improvements contained in Ordinance No. 05-1165 [15-1431] result in any increased City contributions or cost, Member contributions may be increased to cover the cost of said benefit improvements. Member contributions withheld by the City on behalf of the Member shall be deposited with the Board immediately after each pay period. The contributions made by each Member to the Fund shall be designated as employer contributions pursuant to section 414(h) of the Code. Such designation is contingent upon the contributions being excluded from the Members' gross income for Federal Income Tax purposes. For all other purposes of the System, such contributions shall be considered to be Member contributions. 
b.  Firefighter Members. Each Member of the System shall be required to make regular contributions to the Fund in the amount of three percent of his Salary. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Member contribution rate shall be increased or decreased to the rate paid by the Florida Retirement System's "special risk class" employees, effective on the first day of the plan's fiscal year immediately following the FRS increase or decrease. However, if the benefit improvements contained in Ordinance No. 05-1165 [15-1431] result in any increased City contributions or cost, Member contributions may be increased to cover the cost of said benefit improvements. Member contributions withheld by the City or County on behalf of the Member shall be deposited with the Board immediately after each pay period. The contributions made by each Member to the Fund shall be designated as employer contributions pursuant to section 414(h) of the Code. Such designation is contingent upon the contributions being excluded from the Members' gross income for Federal Income Tax purposes. For all other purposes of the System, such contributions shall be considered to be Member contributions. 
(2)  Method. Such contributions shall be made by payroll deduction. 
(b)  State contributions. Any monies received or receivable by reason of laws of the State of Florida, for the express purpose of funding and paying for retirement benefits for Police Officers or Firefighters of the City or County shall be deposited in the Fund comprising part of this System immediately and under no circumstances more than five days after receipt by the City. 
(c)  City contributions. So long as this System is in effect, the City and County shall make at least quarterly contributions to the Fund in an amount equal to the required city contribution, as shown by the applicable actuarial valuation of the System. The County shall contribute to the plan the funding required for the Firefighters as provided for in Section 62-2029. The funding credit balance as reflected in the actuarial valuation report as of October 1, 2004 and future actuarial reports, shall continue to be utilized to offset required City contributions to the pension plan in an amount determined annually by the City, for as long as such credit funding balance exists. 
(d)  Other. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the Fund, but such deposits must be accounted for separately and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis. Funds arising from these sources may be used only for additional benefits for Members, as determined by the Board, and may not be used to reduce what would have otherwise been required City contributions.

(Ord. No. 15-1431, 12-14-15, effective October 1, 2015) 
Sec. 62-2007. - Pre-retirement death. 
(a)  Prior to vesting or eligibility for retirement. The Beneficiary of a deceased Member who had completed less than six years of Credited Service, was not receiving monthly benefits or was not eligible for early or normal retirement shall receive a refund of 100 percent of the Member's Accumulated Contributions.

Sec. 62-2008. - Disability. 
(a)  Disability benefits in-line of duty. Any Member who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a Police Officer or Firefighter, which disability was directly caused by the performance of his duty as a Police Officer or Firefighter, shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the Board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to three percent of his Average Final Compensation multiplied by the total years of Credited Service, but in any event the minimum amount paid to the Member shall be 65 percent of the Average Final Compensation of the Member. Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence: 
(1)  If a member is terminated by the city for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within 30 days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(2)  If a member has resigned from employment or separated from employment in connection with the resolution of a worker's compensation claim with the city and has, prior to such resignation or separation, applied for a disability pension, then such person's application shall continue to be processed and he shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(b)  In-Line of duty presumptions. 
(1)  Presumption. Any condition or impairment of health of a Member caused by hypertension or heart disease shall be presumed to have been suffered in line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence, provided that such Member shall have successfully passed a physical examination upon entering into such service, including cardiogram for Police Officers, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of such condition; and provided further, that such presumption shall not apply to benefits payable or granted in a policy of life insurance or disability insurance. 
(2)  Additional presumption. The presumption provided for in this subsection (2) shall apply only to those conditions described in this subsection (2) that are diagnosed on or after January 1, 1996. 
a.  Definitions. As used in this subsection (b)(2), the following definitions apply: 
Body fluids means blood and body fluids containing visible blood and other body fluids to which universal precautions for prevention of occupational transmission of blood-borne pathogens, as established by the Centers for Disease Control, apply. For purposes of potential transmission of meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis, the term "body fluids" includes respiratory, salivary, and sinus fluids, including droplets, sputum, and saliva, mucous, and other fluids through which infectious airborne organisms can be transmitted between persons. 
Emergency rescue or public safety member means any Member employed full time by the City as a firefighter, paramedic, emergency medical technician, law enforcement officer, or correctional officer who, in the course of employment, runs a high risk of occupational exposure to hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis and who is not employed elsewhere in a similar capacity. However, the term "emergency rescue or public safety Member" does not include any person employed by a public hospital licensed under Chapter 395, Florida Statutes, or any person employed by a subsidiary thereof. 
Hepatitis means hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis non-A, hepatitis non-B, hepatitis C, or any other strain of hepatitis generally recognized by the medical community. 
High risk of occupational exposure means that risk that is incurred because a person subject to the provisions of this subsection, in performing the basic duties associated with his employment: 
1. Provides emergency medical treatment in a non-health-care setting where there is a potential for transfer of body fluids between persons; 
2. At the site of an accident, fire, or other rescue or public safety operation, or in an emergency rescue or public safety vehicle, handles body fluids in or out of containers or works with or otherwise handles needles or other sharp instruments exposed to body fluids; 
3. Engages in the pursuit, apprehension, and arrest of law violators or suspected law violators and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids; or 
4. Is responsible for the custody, and physical restraint when necessary, of prisoners or inmates within a prison, jail, or other criminal detention facility, while on work detail outside the facility, or while being transported and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids. 
Occupational exposure, in the case of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, means an exposure that occurs during the performance of job duties that may place a worker at risk of infection. 
b.  Presumption. Any emergency rescue or public safety Member who suffers a condition or impairment of health that is caused by hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, that requires medical treatment, and that results in total or partial disability or death shall be presumed to have a disability suffered in the line of duty, unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence; however, in order to be entitled to the presumption, the Member must, by written affidavit as provided in F.S. § 92.50, verify by written declaration that, to the best of his knowledge and belief: 
1.  In the case of a medical condition caused by or derived from hepatitis, he has not: 
i.  Been exposed, through transfer of bodily fluids, to any person known to have sickness or medical conditions derived from hepatitis, outside the scope of his employment; 
ii.  Had a transfusion of blood or blood components, other than a transfusion arising out of an accident or injury happening in connection with his present employment, or received any blood products for the treatment of a coagulation disorder since last undergoing medical tests for hepatitis, which tests failed to indicate the presence of hepatitis; 
iii.  Engaged in unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior, as identified by the Centers for Disease Control or the Surgeon General of the United States or had sexual relations with a person known to him to have engaged in such unsafe sexual practices or other high-risk behavior; or 
iv.  Used intravenous drugs not prescribed by a physician. 
2.  In the case of meningococcal meningitis, in the ten days immediately preceding diagnosis he was not exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known to have meningococcal meningitis or known to be an asymptomatic carrier of the disease. 
3.  In the case of tuberculosis, in the period of time since the Member's last negative tuberculosis skin test, he has not been exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known by him to have tuberculosis. 
c.  Immunization. Whenever any standard, medically recognized vaccine or other form of immunization or prophylaxis exists for the prevention of a communicable disease for which a presumption is granted under this section, if medically indicated in the given circumstances pursuant to immunization policies established by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Public Health Service, an emergency rescue or public safety Member may be required by the City to undergo the immunization or prophylaxis unless the Member's physician determines in writing that the immunization or other prophylaxis would pose a significant risk to the Member's health. Absent such written declaration, failure or refusal by an emergency rescue or public safety Member to undergo such immunization or prophylaxis disqualifies the Member from the benefits of the presumption. 
d.  Record of exposures. The City shall maintain a record of any known or reasonably suspected exposure of an emergency rescue or public safety Member in its employ to the disease described in this section and shall immediately notify the Member of such exposure. An emergency rescue or public safety Member shall file an incident or accident report with the City of each instance of known or suspected occupational exposure to hepatitis infection, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis. 
e.  Required medical tests; preemployment physical. In order to be entitled to the presumption provided by this section: 
1.  An emergency rescue or public safety Member must, prior to diagnosis, have undergone standard, medically acceptable tests for evidence of the communicable disease for which the presumption is sought, or evidence of medical conditions derived therefrom, which tests fail to indicate the presence of infection. This paragraph does not apply in the case of meningococcal meningitis. 
2.  On or after June 15, 1995, an emergency rescue or public safety Member may be required to undergo a preemployment physical examination that tests for and fails to reveal any evidence of hepatitis or tuberculosis. 
(c)  Disability benefits not-in-line of duty. Any Member with six years or more Credited Service who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a Police Officer or Firefighter, which disability is not directly caused by the performance of his duties as a Police Officer or Firefighter shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the Board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to three percent of his Average Final Compensation multiplied by the total years of Credited Service. Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence; 
(1)  if a member is terminated by the city for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within 30 days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(2)  if a member has resigned from employment or separated from employment in connection with the resolution of a worker's compensation claim with the city and has, prior to such resignation or separation, applied for a disability pension, then such person's application shall continue to be processed and he shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(d)  Conditions disqualifying disability benefits. Each Member who is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the Board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
(1)  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or narcotics. 
(2)  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections or while committing a crime. 
(3)  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the Armed Forces. 
(4)  Injury or disease sustained after his employment as a Police Officer with the City or Firefighter with the County shall have terminated. 
(5)  For Police Officer Members, injury or disease sustained while working for anyone other than the City and arising out of such employment. 
(e)  Physical examination requirement. 
(1)  A Member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons, who shall be selected by the Board for that purpose. The Board shall not select the Member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose except in an unusual case where the Board determines that it would be reasonable and prudent to do so. 
(2)  Any Retiree receiving disability benefits under provisions of this article may be required by the Board to submit sworn statements of his condition accompanied by a physician's statement (provided at the Retiree's expense) to the Board annually and may be required by the Board to undergo additional periodic re-examinations by a qualified physician or physicians and/or surgeon or surgeons who shall be selected by the Board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the Board finds that the Retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a Police Officer or Firefighter, the Board shall recommend to the City or County that the Retiree be returned to performance of duty as a Police Officer or Firefighter, and the Retiree so returned shall enjoy the same rights that Member had at the time he was placed upon pension. In the event the Retiree so ordered to return shall refuse to comply with the order within 30 days from the issuance thereof, he shall forfeit the right to his pension. 
(3)  The cost of the physical examination and/or re-examination of the Member claiming or the Retiree receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the Fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by the Board incident to the physical examination, such as, but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the Fund. 
(4)  If the Retiree recovers from disability and reenters the service of the City as a Police Officer or the County as a Firefighter, his service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he reentered the service of the City or County will not be considered as Credited Service for the purposes of the System. 
(5)  The Board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability claims. 
(f)  Disability Payments. The monthly benefit to which a Member is entitled in the event of the Member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the Board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the Board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be: 
(1)  If the Retiree recovers from the disability, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery, or 
(2)  If the Retiree dies without recovering from disability, the payment due next preceding his death or the 120th monthly payment, whichever is later. 
Provided, however, the disability Retiree may select, at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in subsection 62-2010(a)(1) or (a)(2), which shall be the Actuarial Equivalent of the normal form of benefit. 
(g)  Workers' compensation. When a Retiree is receiving a disability pension and workers' compensation benefits pursuant to Florida Statute Chapter 440, for the same disability, and the total monthly benefits received from both exceed 100 percent of the Member's average monthly wage, as defined in Chapter 440, Florida Statutes, the disability pension benefit shall be reduced so that the total monthly amount received by the Retiree does not exceed 100 percent of such average monthly wage. The amount of any lump sum workers' compensation payment shall be converted to an equivalent monthly benefit payable for ten Years Certain by dividing the lump sum amount by 83.9692. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the disability pension benefit be reduced below the greater of 42 percent of Average Final Compensation or two percent of Average Final Compensation times years of Credited Service.

Sec. 62-2009. - Vesting. 
    If a Member terminates his employment with the City or County, either voluntarily or by discharge, and is not eligible for any other benefits under this System, the Member shall be entitled to the following: 
(1)  If a Member was hired before September 15, 2013 and has less than six years of Credited Service upon termination, or if a Member was hired on or after September 15, 2013 and has less than eight years of Credited Service upon termination, he shall be entitled to a refund of his Accumulated Contributions or he may leave it deposited with the Fund. 
(2)  If a Member was hired before September 15, 2013 and has six years or more of Credited Service upon termination, or if a Member was hired on or after September 15, 2013 and has eight or more years of Credited Service upon termination, he shall be entitled to a monthly retirement benefit, payable for life, determined in the same manner as for normal or early retirement and based upon the Member's Credited Service, Average Final Compensation and the benefit accrual rate as of the date of termination, payable to him commencing at the Member's otherwise normal or early retirement date, determined as if he had remained employed, or the first day of any month prior to the normal retirement date, in which event the amount shall be reduced as for early retirement, provided he does not elect to withdraw his Accumulated Contributions and provided the Member survives until benefits actually begin. If the Member does not withdraw his Accumulated Contributions and does not survive until his benefits actually begin, his designated Beneficiary shall be entitled to a return of the Member's Accumulated Contributions. 
(Ord. No. 15-1431, 12-14-15, effective October 1, 2015) 
Sec. 62-2010. - Optional forms of benefits. 
(a)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable in the event of normal or early retirement as specified herein, a Member, upon written request to the Board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one of the following options: 
(1)  A retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the Retiree for his lifetime only. 
(2)  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the Retiree during the lifetime of the Retiree and following the death of the Retiree, 100 percent, 75 percent, 66? percent or 50 percent of such monthly amount payable to a joint pensioner for his lifetime. Except where the Retiree's joint pensioner is his spouse, the payments to the joint pensioner as a percentage of the payments to the Retiree shall not exceed the applicable percentage provided for in the applicable table in the Treasury regulations. (See Q & A-2 of 1.401(a)(9)-6) 
(3)  If a Member retires prior to the time at which Social Security benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as social security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of Retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the System, based upon the social security law in effect at the time of the Member's Retirement. 
(b)  The Member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner (subsection (a)(2) above) or Beneficiary (or Beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the System in the event of Member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one or more primary Beneficiaries where applicable. A Member may change his Beneficiary at any time. If a Member has elected an option with a joint pensioner and the Member's retirement income benefits have commenced, the Member may thereafter change his designated Beneficiary at any time, but may only change his joint pensioner twice. Subject to the restriction in the previous sentence, a Member may substitute a new joint pensioner for a deceased joint pensioner. In the absence of proof of good health of the joint pensioner being replaced, the actuary will assume that the joint pensioner has deceased for purposes of calculating the new payment. 
(c)  The consent of a Member's or Retiree's joint pensioner or Beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously-designated Beneficiaries to receive benefits under the System shall thereupon cease. 
(d)  Upon change of a Retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this section, the amount of the retirement income payable to the Retiree shall be actuarially redetermined to take into account the age of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the Retiree and to ensure that the benefit paid is the Actuarial Equivalent of the Retiree's then-current benefit at the time of the change. Any such Retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses and shall make repayment of any overage of previously-paid pension benefits as a result of said recalculations. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the Board and on completion will be filed with the Board. In the event that no designated Beneficiary survives the Retiree, such benefits as are payable in the event of the death of the Retiree subsequent to his Retirement shall be paid as provided in section 62-2011. 
(e)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(1)  If a Member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under section 62-2007. 
(2)  If the designated Beneficiary (or Beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the Member's Retirement under the System, the option elected will be canceled automatically and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the Member upon his Retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with the provisions of this section or a new Beneficiary is designated by the Member prior to his Retirement. 
(3)  If both the Retiree and the Beneficiary (or Beneficiaries) designated by Member or Retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a), the Board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with section 62-2011. 
(4)  If a Member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to the provisions of subsection 62-2006(a), and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to the provisions of this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made, or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a Beneficiary (or Beneficiaries) designated by the Member in the amount or amounts computed as if the Member had retired under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
(5)  The Member's benefit under this Section must begin to be distributed to the Member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the Member attains age 701/2 or the calendar year in which the Member terminates employment with the City. 
(f)  A Retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
(g)  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Board in its discretion, may elect to make a lump sum payment to a Member or a Member's Beneficiary in the event that the total commuted value of the monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed $1,000.00. Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the Board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the System with regard to such Member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(Ord. No. 15-1431, 12-14-15, effective October 1, 2015) 
Sec. 62-2011. - Beneficiaries. 
(a)  Each Member or Retiree may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the Board, designate a Beneficiary (or Beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the event of his death. Each designation may be revoked or changed by such Member or Retiree by signing and filing with the Board a new designation-of-beneficiary form. Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated Beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the System shall cease. 
(b)  If a deceased Member or Retiree failed to name a Beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection (a), or if the Beneficiary (or Beneficiaries) named by a deceased Member or Retiree predeceased the Member or Retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the System with respect to such deceased Member or Retiree, shall be paid to the estate of the Member or Retiree and the Board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum. 
(c)  Any payment made to any person pursuant to this section shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the System with regard to the deceased Member and any other persons with rights under the System and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 15-1431, 12-14-15, effective October 1, 2015) 
Sec. 62-2012. - Claims procedures. 
(a)  The Board shall establish administrative claims procedures to be utilized in processing written requests ("claims"), on matters which affect the substantial rights of any person ("Claimant"), including Members, Retirees, Beneficiaries, or any person affected by a decision of the Board. 
(b)  The Board shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents for discovery prior to and at any proceedings provided for in the Board's claims procedures. The Claimant may request in writing the issuance of subpoenas by the Board. A reasonable fee may be charged for the issuance of any subpoenas not to exceed the fees set forth in Florida Statutes.

Sec. 62-2013. - Reports to Division of Retirement.

(Ord. No. 15-1431, 12-14-15, effective October 1, 2015) 
Sec. 62-2014. - Roster of retirees. 
    The Secretary of the Board shall keep a record of all persons enjoying a pension under the provisions of this article in which it shall be noted the time when the pension is allowed and when the same shall cease to be paid. Additionally, the Secretary shall keep a record of all Members in such a manner as to show the name, address, date of employment and date of termination of employment. 
(Ord. No. 15-1431, 12-14-15, effective October 1, 2015) 
Sec. 62-2015. - Maximum pension. 
(a)  Basic limitation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this System to the contrary, the Member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from the System shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of Code Section 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan Member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in Code Section 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan Member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) ($160,000.00), subject to the applicable adjustments in Code Section 415(b) and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this System. For purposes of this section, "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
    For purposes of Code Section 415(b), the "annual benefit" means a benefit payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity (with no ancillary benefits) without regard to the benefit attributable to after-tax employee contributions (except pursuant to Code Section 415(n) and to rollover contributions (as defined in Code Section 415(b)(2)(A)). The "benefit attributable" shall be determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations. 
(b)  Adjustments to Basic Limitation for Form of Benefit. If the benefit under the plan is other than the annual benefit described in subsection (a), then the benefit shall be adjusted so that it is the equivalent of the annual benefit, using factors prescribed in Treasury Regulations. If the form of the benefit without regard to any automatic benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity or a qualified joint and survivor annuity, then the preceding sentence is applied by either reducing the Code Section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date or adjusting the form of benefit to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the additional benefits under the form of benefit as follows: 
(1)  For a benefit paid in a form to which section 417(e)(3) of the code does not apply (generally, a monthly benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greater of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity (if any) payable to the Member under the plan commencing at the same annuity starting date as the form of benefit to the member, or 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the member, computed using a five percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Rulings 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code); or 
(2)  For a benefit paid in a form to which section 417(e)(3) of the code applies (generally, a lump sum benefit), the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity benefit that is the greatest of: 
a.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using the interest rate and mortality table, or tabular factor, specified in the plan for actuarial experience; 
b.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable, computed using a 5.5 percent interest assumption (or the applicable statutory interest assumption) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code); or 
c.  The annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the particular form of benefit payable (computed using the applicable interest rate for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(3) (the 30-year Treasury rate (prior to January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the month prior to retirement, and on and after January 1, 2007, using the rate in effect for the first day of the plan year with a one-year stabilization period)) and (i) for years prior to January 1, 2009, the applicable mortality tables for the distribution under Treasury Regulation Section 1.417(e)-1(d)(2) (the mortality table specified in Revenue Ruling 2001-62 or any subsequent Revenue Ruling modifying the applicable provisions of Revenue Ruling 2001-62), and (ii) for years after December 31, 2008, the applicable mortality tables described in section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code (Notice 2008-85 or any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance implementing section 417(e)(3)(B) of the code), divided by 1.05. 
(3)  The actuary may adjust the 415(b) limit at the annuity starting date in accordance with subsections (1) and (2) above. 
(c)  Benefits Not Taken into Account. For purposes of this Section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
(1)  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
(2)  Any other benefit not required under § 415(b)(2) of the Code and Regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of Code Section 415(b)(1); and 
(3)  That portion of any joint and survivor annuity that constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity. 
(d)  COLA Effect. Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b) (the "Limit"), the following will apply: 
(1)  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first limitation year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
(2)  Thereafter, in any subsequent limitation year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under Code Section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
(3)  In no event shall a member's benefit payable under the System in any limitation year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code Section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
    Unless otherwise specified in the system, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b), a Member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost of living increases as required by Section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable Treasury Regulations. 
(e)  Other Adjustments in Limitations. 
(1)  In the event the Member's retirement benefits become payable before age 62, the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of Code Section 415(b) of the Code, so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a $160,000.00.00 annual benefit beginning at age 62. 
(2)  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least 15 years of Credited Service as a full-time employee of the fire or police department of the City, the adjustments provided for in (e)(1) above shall not apply. 
(3)  The reductions provided for in (e)(1) above shall not be applicable to disability benefits pursuant to Section 62-2008, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to Section 62-2007. 
(4)  In the event the Member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age 65, for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (a) herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age 65. This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. 
(f)  Less than Ten Years of Participation. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any Member who has completed less than ten years of participation with the City shall be the amount determined under subsection (a) of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of participation and the denominator of which is ten of the limit determined without regard to this subsection. The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below ten percent. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to pre-retirement disability benefits paid pursuant to Section 62-2008, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to Section 62-2007. 
(g)  Participation in Other Defined Benefit Plans. The limit of this section with respect to any Member who at any time has been a Member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in Code Section 414(j) maintained by the City shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all City defined benefit plans in which the Member has been a Member were payable from one plan. 
(h)  Ten Thousand Dollar ($10,000.00) Limit; Less Than Ten Years of Service. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 62-2015, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a Member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this subsection (h) of Section 62-2015 if the benefits payable, with respect to such Member under this System and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the City contributes, do not exceed $10,000.00 for the applicable limitation year or for any prior limitation year, and the City has not at any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the Member participated; provided, however, that if the Member has completed less than ten years of credited service with the City, the limit under this subsection (h) of Section 62-2015 shall be a reduced limit equal to $10,000.00 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten. 
(i)  Reduction of Benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the Member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which Member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which Member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the Member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which Member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the Board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the Board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such Member. 
(j)  Service Credit Purchase Limits. 
(1)  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a Member makes one or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the system, as allowed in Sections 62-2026 and 62-2027, then the requirements of this section will be treated as met only if: 
a.  The requirements of Code Section 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of Code Section 415(b), or 
b.  The requirements of Code Section 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of Code Section 415(c). 
    For purposes of applying subparagraph (j)(1)a., the System will not fail to meet the reduced limit under Code Section 415(b)(2)(C) solely by reason of this subparagraph, and for purposes of applying subparagraph (j)(1)b. the System will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under Section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code solely by reason of this subparagraph. 
(2)  For purposes of this subsection the term "permissive service credit" means service credit- 
a.  recognized by the System for purposes of calculating a Member's benefit under the Plan, 
b.  which such Member has not received under the Plan, and 
c.  which such Member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the System, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the system, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding clause (j)(2)b., may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a Member is receiving under the System. 
(k)  Contribution Limits. 
(1)  For purposes of applying the Code Section 415(c) limits which are incorporated by reference and for purposes of this subsection (k), only and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable will be compensation actually paid or made available during a limitation year, except as noted below and as permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the system, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of Code Section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under Code Sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052 and will be determined without regard to any rules under Code Section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code Section 3401(a)(2). 
a.  However, for limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under Code Sections 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b). For limitation years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of Code Section 132(f)(4). 
b.  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the limitation year will also include compensation paid by the later of 21/2 months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
1.  the payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
2.  the payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
c.  Back pay, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this definition. 
(2)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the board may modify a request by a Member to make a contribution to the system if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in Code Section 415 by using the following methods: 
a.  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the Board may establish a periodic payment deduction plan for the Member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under Code Sections 415(c) or 415(n). 
b.  If payment pursuant to subparagraph (k)(2)a. will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by Code Section 415(c), the Board may either reduce the Member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the Member's contribution. 
(3)  If the annual additions for any Member for a limitation year exceed the limitation under section 415(c) of the code, the excess annual addition will be corrected as permitted under the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System (or similar IRS correction program). 
(4)  For limitation years beginning on or after January 1, 2009, a member's compensation for purposes of this subsection (k) shall not exceed the annual limit under section 401(a)(17) of the code. 
(l)  Additional Limitation on Pension Benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
(1)  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a Retiree who becomes a Member of the System and who has not previously participated in such System, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed 100 percent of his Average Final Compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
(2)  No Member of the System shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the Member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to social security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 1223, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
(m)  Effect of Direct Rollover on 415(b) Limit. If the plan accepts a direct rollover of an employee's or former employee's benefit from a defined contribution plan qualified under Code Section 401(a) which is maintained by the employer, any annuity resulting from the rollover amount that is determined using a more favorable actuarial basis than required under Code Section 417(e) shall be included in the annual benefit for purposes of the limit under Code Section 415(b).

Sec. 62-2016. - Minimum distribution of benefits. 
(a)  General Rules. 
(1)  Effective Date. Effective as of January 1, 1989, the Plan will pay all benefits in accordance with a good faith interpretation of the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations in effect under that section, as applicable to a governmental plan within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 414(d).

The provisions of this Section will apply for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for calendar years beginning with the 2003 calendar year. 
(2)  Precedence. The requirements of this Section will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the Plan. 
(3)  TEFRA Section 242(b)(2) Elections. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section other than this subsection (a)(3), distributions may be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, in accordance with Section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) and the provisions of the plan that related to Section 242(b)(2) of TEFRA. 
(b)  Time and Manner of Distribution. 
(1)  Required Beginning Date. The Member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the Member no later than the Member's required beginning date which shall not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the Member attains age 701/2 or the calendar year in which the Member terminates employment with the City. 
(2)  Death of Member Before Distributions Begin. If the Member dies before distributions begin, the Member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than as follows: 
a.  If the Member's surviving spouse is the Member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Member died, or by a date on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the Member would have attained age 701/2, if later, as the surviving spouse elects. 
b.  If the Member's surviving spouse is not the Member's sole designated beneficiary, then, distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Member died. 
c.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the Member's death, the Member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Member's death. 
d.  If the Member's surviving spouse is the Member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the Member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection (b)(2), other than subsection (b)(2)d., will apply as if the surviving spouse were the Member. 
For purposes of this subsection (b)(2), distributions are considered to begin on the Member's required beginning date or, if subsection 2.B.(4) applies, the date of distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the Member before the Member's required beginning date (or to the Member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a., the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(3)  Death After Distributions Begin. If the Member dies after the required distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the Member's interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution before the Member's death. 
(4)  Form of Distribution. Unless the Member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with this Section. If the Member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury regulations. Any part of the Member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in Section 414(k) of the Code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(c)  Determination of Amount to be Distributed Each Year. 
(1)  General Requirements. If the Member's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the Plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
a.  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year. 
b.  The Member's entire interest must be distributed pursuant to Section 62-2006, Section 62-2007, Section 62-2009, or Section 62-2010 (as applicable) and in any event over a period equal to or less than the Member's life or the lives of the Member and a designated Beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the Member or of the Member and a designated Beneficiary. The life expectancy of the Member, the Member's Spouse, or the Member's Beneficiary may not be recalculated after the initial determination for purposes of determining benefits. 
(2)  Amount Required to be Distributed by Required Beginning Date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the Member's required beginning date (or, if the Member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under Section 62-2007) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., monthly. All of the Member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the Member's required beginning date. 
(3)  Additional Accruals After First Distribution Calendar Year. Any additional benefits accruing to the Member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues.

(g)  Vesting. 
(1)  Member will be 100 percent vested in all benefits upon attainment of the plan's age and service requirements for the Plan's normal retirement benefit; and

(b)  If this article shall be repealed, or if contributions to the System are discontinued or if there is a transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions as provided in Chapter 121, Florida Statutes, the Board shall continue to administer the System in accordance with the provisions of this article, for the sole benefit of the then Members, any Beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one of the options provided for in this article who are designated by any of said Members. In the event of repeal, discontinuance of contributions, or transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions, there shall be full vesting (100 percent) of benefits accrued to date of repeal and such benefits shall be nonforfeitable. 
(c)  The fund shall be distributed in accordance with the following procedures: 
(1)  The Board shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value required to fund all the nonforfeitable benefits after taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The board shall inform the City if additional assets are required, in which event the City shall continue to financially support the plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded. 
(2)  The Board shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or otherwise, for each police officer or firefighter entitled to benefits under the plan as specified in subsection (3). 
(3)  The Board shall distribute the asset value as of the date of termination in the manner set forth in this subsection, on the basis that the amount required to provide any given retirement income is the actuarially computed single-sum value of such retirement income, except that if the method of distribution determined under subsection (2) involves the purchase of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given retirement income is the single premium payable for such annuity. The actuarial single-sum value may not be less than the police officer's or firefighter's accumulated contributions to the plan, with interest if provided by the plan, less the value of any plan benefits previously paid to the police officer or firefighter. 
(4)  If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection (3), and after the payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the city, less return to the State of the State's contributions, provided that, if the excess is less than the total contributions made by the City and the State to date of termination of the plan, such excess shall be divided proportionately to the total contributions made by the City and the State. 
(5)  The Board shall distribute, in accordance with subsection (2), the amounts determined under subsection (3). 
    If, after 24 months after the date the plan terminated or the date the Board received written notice that the contributions thereunder were being permanently discontinued, the City or the Board of the fund affected has not complied with all the provisions in this section, the Florida Department of Management Services will effect the termination of the fund in accordance with this section.

Sec. 62-2024. - Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions; elimination of mandatory distributions. 
(a)  Rollover distributions. 
(1)  General. This Section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the System to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions. 
Eligible Rollover Distribution : An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of any or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated Beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income. Effective January 1, 2002, any portion of any distribution which would be includible in gross income as after-tax employee contributions will be an eligible rollover distribution if the distribution is made to an individual retirement account described in section 408(a); to an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b); to a qualified defined contribution plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible; or on or after January 1, 2007, to a qualified defined benefit plan described in Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a) or to an annuity contract described in Internal Revenue Code Section 403(b), that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not so includible. 
Eligible Retirement Plan : An eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the Code; an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the Code; an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the Code; effective January 1, 2002, an eligible deferred compensation plan described in section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by an eligible employer described in section 457(e)(1)(A) of the Code and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan; effective January 1, 2002, an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Code; a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the Code; or effective January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described in Section 408A of the Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. This definition shall also apply in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving Spouse. 
Distributee : A distributee includes an employee or former employee. It also includes the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse. Effective January 1, 2007, it further includes a nonspouse beneficiary who is a designated beneficiary as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(9)(E). However, a nonspouse beneficiary may rollover the distribution only to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving the distribution and the account or annuity will be treated as an "inherited" individual retirement account or annuity. 
Direct Rollover : A direct rollover is a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(b)  Rollovers or transfers into the fund. On or after January 1, 2002, the System will accept, solely for the purpose of purchasing Credited Service as provided herein, permissible Member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans, Member rollover cash contributions and/or direct cash rollovers of distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, as follows: 
(1)  Transfers and direct rollovers or Member rollover contributions from other plans. The System will accept either a direct rollover of an eligible rollover distribution or a Member contribution of an eligible rollover distribution from a qualified plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code, from an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the Code or from an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state. The System will also accept legally permissible Member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans. 
(2)  Member rollover contributions from IRAs. The System will accept a Member rollover contribution of the portion of a distribution from an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or 408(b) of the Code that is eligible to be rolled over. 
(c)  Elimination of mandatory distributions. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event this Plan provides for a mandatory (involuntary) cash distribution from the Plan not otherwise required by law, for an amount in excess of $1,000.00, such distribution shall be made from the Plan only upon written request of the Member and completion by the Member of a written election on forms designated by the Board, to either receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount.

Sec. 62-2028. - Reemployment after retirement. 
(a)  Any retiree under this system, except for disability retirement as previously provided for, may be reemployed by any public or private employer, except the City, and may receive compensation from that employment without limiting or restricting in any way the retirement benefits payable under this System. Reemployment by the City shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this section. 
(b)  After normal retirement. Any retiree who is retired under normal (or early) retirement pursuant to this System and who is reemployed as a Police Officer and, by virtue of that reemployment, is eligible to participate in this System, shall upon being reemployed, discontinue receipt of benefits. Upon reemployment, the Member shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional Credited Service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final Retirement. Calculations of benefits upon Retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, Average Final Compensation, and Credited Service (and early retirement reduction factor, if applicable) as of that date and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, Average Final Compensation (based only on the subsequent employment period), and Credited Service (and early retirement reduction factor, if applicable) as of the date of subsequent retirement. The amount of any death or disability benefit received during a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the Retiree may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable only to the subsequent retirement benefit.

If the reemployed person is not eligible to participate in this System, that person's pension benefit payments shall be suspended until the earlier of termination of employment or such time as the reemployed retiree reaches the date that he would have been eligible for normal retirement under this system had he continued employment and not elected early retirement. "Normal retirement" as used in this subsection shall be the current normal retirement date provided for under this system. 
(e)  Reemployment of terminated vested persons. Reemployed terminated vested persons shall not be subject to the provisions of this section until such time as they begin to actually receive benefits. Upon receipt of benefits, terminated vested persons shall be treated as normal or early Retirees for purposes of applying the provisions of this section and their status as an early or normal Retiree shall be determined by the date they elect to begin to receive their benefit.

Sec. 62-2029. - Merger with County Fire Service. 
    Pursuant to an inter-local agreement with Seminole County, the Casselberry Fire Department merged with the County Fire Service on October 1, 2015. Pursuant to that agreement and notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, the following transitional rules shall apply to Firefighters who have elected to remain Members of this System subsequent to the merger. 
(1)  In the event a Firefighter has opted to remain in the System, the Firefighter shall be required to contribute three percent (3.0%) or such other amount as provided in Sec. 62-2005, of his Salary to the System. The County agrees to pay to the System the amount the City would otherwise be required to contribute to the plan necessary to maintain the actuarial soundness of the System as determined by the plan's actuary, so long as the total percentage of the County's contribution does not exceed the percentage that the County pays into the Florida Retirement System for its firefighter employees, as required by the State actuary, (hereinafter the AFRS Rate). As the current FRS Rate is 22.04 percent and the Firefighter contribution is three percent, the entire City contribution (20.8 percent) for the Firefighters shall be paid in full by the County for the fiscal year beginning October 1, 2015. In the event that the required City contribution to the plan, as determined by the plan's actuary, exceeds the AFRS Rate, the City shall be required to pay any such excess. 
(2)  The required contribution of both Member contributions and the County contributions shall be transferred by the County to the City by wire on the same day payroll is paid. The City agrees to transfer to the System by wire or otherwise deposit the funds received from the County within one business day from the day it is received from the County. 
(3)  The Board of Trustees shall remain responsible for administration of the System and the City shall continue to have the authority to make plan amendments and improvements. The System shall be responsible to make pension benefits payable to all current and future Retirees from the System, including Firefighters who have opted to remain in the System. 
(4)  Any Firefighter electing to remain in the System may continue membership in the System until Retirement and upon termination of employment and Retirement from the System shall be allowed to be reemployed by the County and shall become a member of the County retirement program in the same manner as a new County employee. 
(5)  In the event a Firefighter has opted to join the County retirement program and has less than six years or eight years of Credited Service in the System pursuant to the provisions of Sec. 62-2009, the Firefighter shall receive a refund of his Accumulated Contributions from the System upon completion of the necessary forms. 
(6)  In the event a Firefighter has opted to join the County retirement program and has six or more years of Credited Service if hired before September 15, 2013 or eight or more years if hired on or after September 15, 2013 in the System, the Firefighter may either receive an immediate or deferred early retirement benefit or a refund of his Accumulated Contributions from the System. If the Firefighter has opted to retire from the System, the Firefighter will then be eligible to join the County retirement system in the same manner as all other new County employees.

Sec. 62-2030. - Supplemental benefit component for special benefits; Chapter 175 and 185 share accounts. 
    There is hereby established an additional plan component to provide special benefits in the form of a supplemental retirement, termination, death and disability benefit to be in addition to the benefits provided for in the previous Sections of this plan, such benefit to be funded solely and entirely by Chapter 175 and 185 premium tax monies for each Plan Year which are allocated to this supplemental component as provided for in Sections 175.351 and 185.35. Amounts allocated to this supplemental component ("Share Plan"), if any, shall be further allocated to the Members and DROP participants as follows: 
(a)  Individual Member Share Accounts. The Board shall create individual "Member Share Accounts" for all actively employed plan Members and DROP participants and maintain appropriate books and records showing the respective interest of each Member or DROP participant hereunder. Each Member or DROP participant shall have a Member Share Account for his share of the Chapter 175 or 185, Florida Statutes, tax revenues described above, forfeitures and income and expense adjustments relating thereto. The Board shall maintain separate Member Share Accounts, however, the maintenance of separate accounts is for accounting purposes only and a segregation of the assets of the trust fund to each account shall not be required or permitted. 
(b)  Share Account Funding. 
(1)  Individual Member Share Accounts shall be established as of September 30, 2015 for all Members and DROP participants who were actively employed as of October 1, 2014. Individual Member Share Accounts shall be credited with an allocation as provided for in the following subsection (c) of any premium tax monies which have been allocated to the share plan for that Plan Year, beginning with the Plan Year ending September 30, 2015. 
(2)  In addition, any forfeitures as provided in subsection (d), shall be allocated to the individual Member share accounts in accordance with the formula set forth in subsection (d). 
(c)  Allocation of Monies to Share Accounts. 
(1)  Allocation of Chapter 175 and 185 Contributions. 
a.  Effective as of September 30, 2015, the amount of any premium tax monies allocated to the Share Plan shall be allocated to individual Member Share Accounts as provided for in this subsection. Members retiring on or after October 1, 2014 and prior to September 30, 2015 shall receive an allocation. In addition, all premium tax monies allocated to the Share Plan in any subsequent Plan Year shall also be allocated as provided for in this subsection. Available premium tax monies shall be allocated to individual Member Share Accounts at the end of each Plan Year on September 30 (a "valuation date"). 
b.  On each valuation date, each current actively employed Member of the plan not participating in the DROP, each DROP participant and each Retiree who retires or DROP participant who has terminated DROP participation in the Plan Year ending on the valuation date (including each disability retiree), or Beneficiary of a deceased Member (not including terminated vested persons) who is otherwise eligible for an allocation as of the valuation date shall receive a share allocation as follows: 
c.  The total funds subject to allocation on each valuation date shall be allocated to each Member Share Account of those eligible for an allocation in an amount equal to a fraction of the total amount, the numerator of which shall be the individual's total years and fractional parts of years of Credited Service as of the valuation date, and the denominator of which shall be the sum of the total years and fractional parts of years of Credited Service as of the valuation date of all individuals to whom allocations are being made. Beneficiaries shall receive an allocation based on the years of Credited Service of the deceased Member or DROP participant. 
d.  Re-employed Retirees shall be deemed new employees and shall receive an allocation based solely on the Credited Service in the reemployment period. 
(2)  Allocation of Investment Gains and Losses. On each valuation date, each individual Member Share Account shall be adjusted to reflect the net earnings or losses resulting from investments during the year. The net earnings or losses allocated to the individual Member Share Accounts shall be the same percentage which is earned or lost by the total plan investments, including realized and unrealized gains or losses, net of brokerage commissions, transaction costs and management fees. 
Net earnings or losses are determined as of the last business day of the fiscal year, which is the valuation date, and are debited or credited as of such date.

The investment consultant shall report these annual contractual fees to the Board. The investment consultant shall also report the net investment return for each manager and the net investment return for the total plan assets. 
(3)  Allocation of Costs, Fees and Expenses. On each valuation date, each individual Member Share Account shall be adjusted to allocate its pro rata share of the costs, fees and expenses of administration of the Share Plan. These fees shall be allocated to each individual Member Share Account on a proportionate basis taking the costs, fees and expenses of administration of the Share Plan as a whole multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total assets in each individual Member Share Account (after adding the annual investment gain or loss) and the denominator of which is the total assets of the fund as a whole as of the same date. 
(4)  No Right to Allocation. The fact of allocation or credit of an allocation to a Member's Share Account by the Board shall not vest in any Member, any right, title, or interest in the assets of the trust or in the Chapter 175 or 185 tax revenues except at the time or times, to the extent, and subject to the terms and conditions provided in this Section. 
(5)  Members shall be provided annual statements setting forth their share account balance as of the end of the Plan Year.

Any Member who has less than six years of Credited Service if the Member was hired before September 15, 2013 or eight years of Credited Service if the Member was hired on or after September 15, 2013 and who is not otherwise eligible for payment of benefits after termination of employment with the City as provided for in subsection (e) shall forfeit his individual Member share account or the non-vested portion thereof. Forfeited amounts shall be redistributed to the other individual Member Share Accounts on each valuation date in an amount determined in accordance with subsection (c)(1).

(2)  Termination Benefit. 
a.  In the event that a Member's employment as a Police Officer with the City or Firefighter with the County is terminated by reason other than retirement, death or disability, he shall be entitled to receive the value of his share account only if he is vested in accordance with Section 62-2009.

Neither the Board nor any Trustee shall be liable for the making, retention, or sale of any investment or reinvestment made as herein provided, nor for any loss or diminishment of the Member Share Account balances, except due to his or its own negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith. All investments shall be made by the Board subject to the restrictions otherwise applicable to fund investments. 
(h)  Notional account. The Member Share Account is a notional account, used only for the purpose of calculation of the share distribution amount. It is not a separate account in the System.

The Board shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in reliance upon such expert, accountant, actuary or counsel, and all actions taken or suffered in such reliance shall be conclusive upon any person with any interest in the DROP. 
(f)  General Provisions. 
(1)  The DROP Is Not a Separate Retirement Plan. Instead, it is a program under which a Member who is eligible for normal retirement under the System may elect to accrue future retirement benefits in the manner provided in this Section 62-2031 for the remainder of his employment, rather than in the normal manner provided under the plan. Upon termination of employment, a Member is entitled to a lump sum distribution of his or her DROP Account balance or may elect a rollover. The DROP Account distribution is in addition to the Member's monthly benefit. 
(2)  Notional Account. The DROP Account established for such a Member is a notional account, used only for the purpose of calculation of the DROP distribution amount. It is not a separate account in the System. There is no change in the System's assets, and there is no distribution available to the Member until the Member's termination from the DROP. The Member has no control over the investment of the DROP Account. 
(3)  No Employer Discretion. The DROP benefit is determined pursuant to a specific formula which does not involve employer discretion. 
(4)  IRC Limit. The DROP Account distribution, along with other benefits payable from the System, is subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b). 
(5)  Amendment of DROP. The DROP may be amended by an ordinance of the City at any time and from time to time, and retroactively if deemed necessary or appropriate, to amend in whole or in part any or all of the provisions of the DROP. However, except as otherwise provided by law, no amendment shall make it possible for any part of the DROP's funds to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of persons entitled to benefits under the DROP. No amendment shall be made which has the effect of decreasing the balance of the DROP Account of any Member. 
(6)  Facility of Payment. If a Member or other person entitled to a benefit under the DROP is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident or is a minor, the Board shall direct that any benefit due him shall be made only to a duly appointed legal representative. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of the liabilities of the DROP for that benefit. 
(7)  Information. Each Member, Beneficiary or other person entitled to a benefit, before any benefit shall be payable to him or on his account under the DROP, shall file with the Board the information that it shall require to establish his rights and benefits under the DROP. 
(8)  Prevention of Escheat. If the Board cannot ascertain the whereabouts of any person to whom a payment is due under the DROP, the Board may, no earlier than three years from the date such payment is due, mail a notice of such due and owing payment to the last known address of such person, as shown on the records of the Board or the County. If such person has not made written claim therefor within three months of the date of the mailing, the Board may, if it so elects and upon receiving advice from counsel to the System, direct that such payment and all remaining payments otherwise due such person be canceled on the records of the System. Upon such cancellation, the System shall have no further liability therefor except that, in the event such person or his Beneficiary later notifies the Board of his whereabouts and requests the payment or payments due to him under the DROP, the amount so applied shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of the DROP. 
(9)  Written Elections, Notification. 
a.  Any elections, notifications or designations made by a Member pursuant to the provisions of the DROP shall be made in writing and filed with the Board in a time and manner determined by the Board under rules uniformly applicable to all employees similarly situated. The Board reserves the right to change from time to time the manner for making notifications, elections or designations by Members under the DROP if it determines after due deliberation that such action is justified in that it improves the administration of the DROP. In the event of a conflict between the provisions for making an election, notification or designation set forth in the DROP and such new administrative procedures, those new administrative procedures shall prevail. 
b.  Each Member or Retiree who has a DROP Account shall be responsible for furnishing the Board with his current address and any subsequent changes in his address. Any notice required to be given to a Member or Retiree hereunder shall be deemed given if directed to him at the last such address given to the Board and mailed by registered or certified United States mail. If any check mailed by registered or certified United States mail to such address is returned, mailing of checks will be suspended until such time as the Member or Retiree notifies the Board of his address. 
(10)  Benefits Not Guaranteed. All benefits payable to a Member from the DROP shall be paid only from the assets of the Member's DROP Account and neither the City, the County nor the Board shall have any duty or liability to furnish the DROP with any funds, securities or other assets except to the extent required by any applicable law. 
(11)  Construction. 
a.  The DROP shall be construed, regulated and administered under the laws of Florida, except where other applicable law controls. 
b.  The titles and headings of the subsections in this Section 62-2031 are for convenience only. In the case of ambiguity or inconsistency, the text rather than the titles or headings shall control. 
(12)  Forfeiture of Retirement Benefits. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to remove DROP participants from the application of any forfeiture provisions applicable to the System. DROP participants shall be subject to forfeiture of all retirement benefits, including DROP benefits. 
(13)  Effect of DROP Participation on Employment. Participation in the DROP is not a guarantee of employment and DROP participants shall be subject to the same employment standards and policies that are applicable to employees who are not DROP participants.

Whenever the City Commission has taken final action regarding changing the zoning classification of property, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall not reconsider any petition for the rezoning of any part or all of the same property for a period of 180 days from the date of the final consideration by the City Commission. However, the time limits of this subsection may be waived by the affirmative vote of four members of the City Commission when such action is deemed necessary to prevent injustice or to facilitate the proper development of the City.

    It is the intent of the City of Casselberry to promote the public health, safety and general welfare by: providing for the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way within the City of Casselberry; adopting and administering reasonable rules and regulations not inconsistent with state and federal law, including F.S. § 337.401, as amended, the City of Casselberry's home-rule authority, and in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 and other federal and state law; establishing reasonable rules and regulations necessary to manage the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way by all communications services providers; and minimizing disruption to the public rights-of-way. In regulating its public rights-of-way, the City of Casselberry shall be governed by and shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws. These regulations are specifically subject to state and federal law limitations. 
(Ord. No. 18-1485, § 3, 7-23-18)

    For purposes of this Article, the following terms, phrases, words and their derivations shall have the meanings given. Where not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include the future tense, words in the plural number include the singular number, and words in the singular number include the plural number.

(4)  The type of communications services that the applicant intends to provide within the corporate limits of the City (if more than one, state all that apply), or, if none, state that the applicant is a pass-through provider or is intending only to place and maintain pass-through facilities, as the case may be, and whether the applicant currently remits or intends to remit Communications Services Tax, as authorized in F.S. ch. 202; and 
(5)  A copy of both the applicant's resale certificate and certificate of registration issued by the Florida Department of Revenue to engage in the business of providing communications services in the State of Florida, if any; and 
(6)  A copy of the applicant's certificate of authorization, public convenience and necessity of other similar certification issued by the Florida Public Service Commission, the FCC, or other federal or state authority, if any; and

If the applicant submits information in accordance with subsection (b) above, the registration shall be effective and the City shall notify the applicant of the effectiveness of registration in writing. If the City determines that the information has not been submitted in accordance with subsection (b) above, the City shall notify the applicant of the non-effectiveness of registration, and reasons for the non-effectiveness, in writing. The City shall so reply to an applicant within 30 days after receipt of registration information from the applicant. Non-effectiveness of registration shall not preclude an applicant from filing subsequent applications for registration under the provisions of this section. An applicant has 30 days after receipt of a notice of non-effectiveness of registration to appeal the decision as provided in section 68-164. 
(d)  Application Fees. No registration application fees shall be imposed for registration under this article. 
(e)  Limits of Registration. An effective registration shall not convey any title, equitable or legal, to the registrant in the public rights-of-way. Registration under this article governs only the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in public rights-of-way. Other ordinances, codes or regulations may apply to the placement or maintenance in the public rights-of-way of facilities that are not communications facilities. Registration does not excuse a communications services provider from obtaining appropriate access or pole attachment agreements before locating its facilities on the City or another person's facilities. Registration does not excuse a communications services provider from complying with all applicable City ordinances, codes or regulations, including this article. 
(f)  Cancellation of Registration. A registrant may cancel a registration upon written notice to the City stating that it will no longer place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way within the City and will no longer need to obtain permits to perform work in public rights-of-way. A registrant cannot cancel a registration if the registrant continues to place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way. 
(g)  Non-exclusivity. Registration does not in and of itself establish a right to place or maintain or priority for the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way within the City but shall establish for the registrant a right to apply for a permit, if permitting is required by the City. Registrations are expressly subject to any future amendment to or replacement of this article and further subject to any additional City ordinances, as well as any state or federal laws that may be enacted. Registration does not excuse or exempt a communications services provider from having to obtain a local business tax receipt, if required, from the City in accordance with the City code. 
(h)  Registration Renewal. A registrant shall renew its registration with the City by October 1 of even numbered years in accordance with the registration requirements in this article, except that a registrant that initially registers during the even numbered year when renewal would be due or the odd numbered year immediately preceding such even numbered year shall not be required to renew until the next even numbered year. Within 30 days of any change in the information required to be submitted pursuant to subsection (b), a registrant shall provide updated information to the City. If no information in the then-existing registration has changed, the renewal may state that no information has changed. Failure to renew a registration may result in the City restricting the issuance of additional permits until the communications services provider has complied with the registration requirements of this article. 
(i)  Effect of Registration. In accordance with applicable City ordinances, codes or regulations, a communications rights-of-way permit shall be required of a communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way. An effective registration shall be a condition of obtaining such permit. Notwithstanding an effective registration, permitting requirements shall apply. Subject to the terms and conditions prescribed in this article, a registrant may apply for a permit to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way. 
(j)  Applicability to resellers. A reseller, which by definition does not place or maintain communications facilities in the public rights-of-way, is not required to register with the City. 
(Ord. No. 18-1485, § 3, 7-23-18) 
Sec. 68-156. - Permit required. 
(a)  Communications Rights-of-Way Permit Required. Unless otherwise exempt as provided herein, a communications services provider shall not commence to place, modify, or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way until all applicable permits, including, but not limited to, a communications rights-of-way permit issued in accordance with this article, have been issued by the City or other appropriate authority. An effective registration shall be a condition of obtaining a permit. A permit may be obtained by or on behalf of a registration having an effective registration if all permitting requirements are met. The communications services provider acknowledges that as a condition of granting such permits, the City may impose reasonable rules or regulations governing the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way. Permits shall apply only to the areas of public rights-of-way specifically identified in the permit. 
(b)  Permit Not Required. 
(1)  A registrant shall be allowed to perform emergency maintenance within the public rights-of-way without first obtaining a permit. The term "emergency" shall mean a condition that affects the public's health, safety or welfare, which includes an unplanned out-of-service condition of a pre-existing service. Registrant shall provide prompt notice to the City of the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the event of an emergency, and may be required to obtain an after-the-fact permit within 15 days of completing the emergency work, if a permit would have originally been required to perform the work undertaken in public rights-of-way in connection with the emergency. 
(2)  A registrant shall be allowed to perform routine maintenance within the public rights-of-way if such proposed routine maintenance does not involve excavation, construction, or disruption to transportation in the public rights-of-way.

(12)  Sunshine State One-Call. Every communications services provider shall utilize, and if permissible, maintain membership in the utility notification one call system administered by Sunshine State One-Call of Florida, Inc. 
(13)  Safety and Minimal Interference. All placement and maintenance of communication facilities in the public rights-of-way shall be subject to the City Code and other regulations of the City, and shall be performed with the least possible interference with the use and appearance of the public rights-of-way and the rights and reasonable convenience of the property owners who abut or adjoin the public rights-of-way and in compliance with the rules and regulations of the Florida Department of Transportation. The communications services provider shall at all times employ reasonable care and use commonly accepted methods and devices for preventing failures and accidents which are likely to cause damage or injury or be a nuisance to the public. Suitable barricades, flags, lights, flares, or other devices shall be used at such times and places as are reasonably required for the safety of all members of the public. All placement and maintenance shall be done in such a manner as to minimize to the greatest extent any interference with the usual travel on such public rights-of-way. The use of trenchless technology (i.e., microtunneling and horizontal directional drilling techniques) for the installation of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way as well as joint trenching or the collocation of facilities in existing conduit is strongly encouraged, and should be employed wherever and whenever feasible. 
(14)  Correction of Harmful Conditions. If, at any time, the City or other authority of competent jurisdiction reasonably determines that any communications facility is, or has caused a condition that is, harmful to the health, safety or general welfare of any person, then the communications services provider shall, at its own expense, promptly correct or eliminate all such facilities and conditions. In an emergency, as determined by the City Engineer, when the communications services provider is not immediately available or is unable to provide the necessary immediate repairs to any communications facility that is damaged or malfunctioning, or has caused a sunken area or other condition and, in the City Engineer's sole discretion, is deemed a threat to public safety, then the City, when apprised of such an emergency, shall have the right to remove, make repairs to or eliminate same with the total cost being charged to and paid for by the communications services provider upon demand. 
(15)  Remedy of Hazardous Conditions. If, at any time, a condition exists that the City or other authority of competent jurisdiction reasonably determines is an emergency that is potentially hazardous or life threatening to any person or is a threat to the health or safety of the general public, and to remedy such condition the City or other authority of competent jurisdiction reasonably determines that a communications services provider must temporarily relocate or temporarily shut off service or transmissions through a specific facility, then the City, as an appropriate exercise of its police powers, may order the communications services provider to immediately perform such temporary relocation or shut off until the condition has been remedied, and to do so at its own expense and without liability to or recourse against the City. In such an emergency, when the communications services provider is not immediately available or is unable to provide the necessary immediate relocation or shut off of the specific communications facility, then the City shall have the right to perform, or cause to be performed, such temporary relocation or shut off until the condition has been remedied with the total cost being charged to and paid for by the communications services provider upon demand. 
(16)  Interference with Other Facilities. A communications services provider shall not, in violation of any applicable laws or regulatory standards, design, place or maintain its communications facilities in a manner that will interfere with the signals or facilities of any municipal or county police, fire or rescue department, the facilities of any public utility, or the communications facilities of another communications service provider, including any cable service provider. 
(17)  Relocation or Removal of Facilities. 
a.  The grant of a permit under this article shall not limit the authority and discretion of the City to regulate and control the public rights-of-way, and the city may at any time require the removal or relocation of a wireless or other communications facility within the rights-of-way in the interests of the public welfare, health, or safety, or as otherwise authorized by law. The registrant must remove its wireless facilities within 30 days' notice that the City will remove a utility pole. 
b.  Removal or relocation at the direction of the City of a registrant's communications facility in public rights-of-way shall be governed by applicable requirements of F.S. §§ 337.403 and 337.404, as amended, in addition to any other applicable City regulations or provisions of law. Unless otherwise provided by law, this City Code, or an agreement, a registrant shall bear all costs of any removal or relocation of its facilities. 
(18)  Temporary Raising or Lowering of Facilities. A communications services provider, upon request of any person holding a validly issued building or moving permit from the City to temporarily encroach on or perform moving operations in or across the public rights-of-way, shall temporarily raise or lower its communications facilities to accommodate such temporary encroachment or move. The expense of such temporary raising or lowering of facilities shall be paid by the Person requesting the same, and the communications services provider shall have the authority to require such payment in advance. The communications services provider shall be given not less than 20 days advance written notice from such person to arrange for the temporary relocation, which notice must detail the time and location of the permitted activity, and not less than 24 hours advance notice from the permit holder advising of the actual operation. The City is not subject to, nor shall it be liable for, any such expense or notice requirement for the moving of houses or structures unless performed by the City or its contractors. 
(19)  Coordination. In an effort to minimize the adverse impact on the public rights-of-way and other municipal improvements, a communications services provider may be required by the City Engineer to coordinate the placement or maintenance of its facilities with any work, construction, installation in or repairs of the subject public rights-of-way or other facilities therein that is occurring or is scheduled to occur within a reasonable time from application for a permit as determined by the City Engineer. Every communications services provider shall make space in its trench and/or conduit within the public rights-of-way available to other providers consistent with the federal requirements of 47 U.S.C. 224. Every communications services provider shall utilize existing conduits, pathways and other facilities whenever possible, and shall not place or maintain any new, different, or additional poles, conduits, pathways or other facilities, whether in the public rights-of-way or on privately-owned property, until written approval is obtained from the City or other appropriate governmental authority, and, where applicable, from the private property owner. 
(20)  Collocation and Joint Use. A communications services provider, in an effort to minimize the adverse impact on the useful life of the public rights-of-way, shall, whenever possible, enter into joint use agreements with the City and other parties who have registered with, or who are expressly authorized by, the City to use its public rights-of-way; provided that the terms of such agreements are satisfactory to the communications services provider. Nothing herein shall mandate that the communications services provider enter into joint use agreements with parties other than the City. However, prior to placement of any new or additional underground conduit in the public rights-of-way, a communications services provider is required to certify in writing to the City Engineer that it has made appropriate inquiry to all existing utilities and other entities possessing a right to occupy the public rights-of-way as to the availability of existing or planned conduit that the particular communications services provider could reasonably utilize to meet its needs, and that no such conduit is available or planned at a reasonable cost by any other entity on the time schedule reasonably needed. The communications services provider shall not be permitted to perform any placement or maintenance of facilities in those segments of the public rights-of-way where there exists vacant or available conduit, dark fiber or surplus fiber owned by the City, or another governmental body which is or, through a reasonable amount of effort and expense, can be made compatible with the communications services provider's system or network. Under such circumstances the communications services provider shall have the opportunity to enter into a use agreement or lease arrangement with the City at or below reasonable and prevailing market rates for such conduit or fiber or, where owned by another governmental body, shall, in good faith, first exhaust all means of obtaining use of such conduit or fiber before applying for a permit from the City. 
(21)  Maintenance-of-Traffic. In the event that placement or maintenance of communications facilities conducted by the communications services provider requires streets or traffic lanes to be closed or obstructed, the communications services provider must, pursuant to the requirements of existing or subsequently enacted City ordinances, obtain all necessary permits from City, and shall obtain approval of its maintenance-of-traffic plan from the City Engineer. 
(22)  Restoration of the Public Rights-of-Way. After completion of any placement or maintenance of a communications facility in the public rights-of-way or each phase thereof, the communications services provider shall, at its own expense and in a manner reasonably acceptable to the City, restore without delay the public rights-of-way so disturbed to its original condition immediately prior to the placement or maintenance work. If the communications services provider fails to make such restoration within 30 days following the completion of such placement or maintenance, the City may perform such restoration and charge the costs of the restoration to the communications services provider in accordance with F.S. § 337.402, as it may be amended. The communications services provider shall, to the satisfaction of the City Engineer, maintain and correct any restorations made pursuant hereto for a period of 12 months following the date of its completion. Failure to comply with this subsection shall be deemed sufficient grounds for denial of any future permits for the placement or maintenance of communications facilities. 
(23)  Disruption or Destruction of Other Facilities or Property. A communications services provider shall not knowingly place or maintain any Facility in a manner that shall in any way disrupt, displace, damage or destroy any sewer line, gas line, water main, pipe, conduit, wires, fiber-optics or other facilities, or property belonging to the City or any other person lawfully occupying the public rights-of-way, without first obtaining the explicit and specific consent of the City. The communications services provider shall bear all responsibility and costs for any such conduct where City consent has not been obtained and shall pay such costs upon demand. 
(24)  Preservation of Public Rights-of-Way for Planned Public Projects. To the extent not otherwise prohibited by state or federal law, the City shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional communications facilities within a particular area of public rights-of-way and may consider, among other things and without limitation, the sufficiency of space to accommodate all of the present communications facilities and pending applications to place and maintain facilities in that area of the public rights-of-way, the sufficiency of space to accommodate City announced plans for public improvements or projects that the City determines are in the public interest, the impact on traffic and traffic safety, and the impact upon existing facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
(25)  City Not Liable. Except for acts of willful misconduct or gross negligence and to the extent permitted by applicable law, neither the City nor its officials, boards, commissions, consultants, agents, employees or independent contractors shall have any liability to the communications services provider for any claims for any damages, costs, expenses or losses resulting from the City's breakage, removal, alteration or relocation of any facilities of any communications services provider which arose out of or in connection with any emergency or disaster situation or was, in the sole discretion of the City Engineer, deemed necessary to facilitate any public works project, public improvement, alteration of a City structure, change in the grade or line of any public rights-of-way, or the elimination, abandonment or closure of any public rights-of-way or was found by City Commission to be in the best interest of the health, safety or general welfare of the public; nor shall any charge be made by the communications services provider against the City for any related damages, costs, expenses or losses. 
(26)  No Exemption from Permits. Except as provided herein, nothing in this article shall exempt any communications Services provider from obtaining permits for work done within the public rights-of-way. 
(27)  Subject to Police Powers. The rights of the communications services provider shall be subject to all lawful exercise of police power by the City, and to such other reasonable regulation of the public rights-of-way as the City shall hereafter by resolution or ordinance provide in the interest of the health, safety and general welfare of the public. Any inconsistency or ambiguity between the provisions of this article and any lawful exercise of the City's police power shall be resolved in favor of the latter. 
(28)  City Inspection. The City shall have the right to make such inspections of a communications system or facilities placed or maintained in the public rights-of-way as it finds necessary to ensure compliance with this article. This article shall not be construed to create or hold the City responsible or liable for any damage to persons or property by reason of any inspection by the City of the placement or maintenance of a communications system or facility as authorized herein or failure by the City to so inspect. 
(29)  Access to Manholes. The City, in the proper exercise of its municipal powers and duties with respect to the public rights-of-way, shall have access at any time to all hand holes and manholes in the City belonging to a communications services provider. Before accessing any manhole, the City will make a reasonable good faith effort to provide the communications services provider prior notice to afford an opportunity to have trained personnel present, unless determined by the City to be an emergency situation. 
(30)  Compatibility, Capacity and Interference Issues. To properly manage and control the use of the public rights-of-way, and to protect the health, safety and general welfare of the public, the City, in its legislative and regulatory role, shall be the final authority on permitting a communications system or facility to be placed in the public rights-of-way and shall exercise such authority in a non-discriminatory manner. It shall be in the sole discretion of the City Attorney whether an easement is compatible with or allows for its use by a communications system or facility. It shall be in the sole discretion of the City Engineer, based on the nature, design, size, configuration or proposed location of any communications system or facility, whether there is sufficient capacity in a particular section of the public rights-of-way or whether such system or facility will interfere with the facilities or equipment of any municipality, county, public utility, cable operator, or other communications services provider. 
(31)  No Warranty of Fitness or Suitability. The City makes no express or implied warranties or representations regarding the fitness, suitability, or availability of the public rights-of-way for any communications system or facility or its right to authorize the placement or maintenance of any communications system or facility in the public rights-of-way. Any performance of work, costs incurred or services rendered by a communications services provider shall be at such provider's sole risk. Nothing in this article shall affect the City's authority to acquire or add public rights-of-way, or to vacate or abandon public rights-of-way as provided for in the City Code or applicable law. The City makes no express or implied warranties or representations regarding the availability of any acquired, added, vacated or abandoned public rights-of-way for a communications system or facility. 
(32)  Taxes. A registrant shall pay any personal property or other taxes or assessments that may be imposed on the registrant's small wireless facility, micro wireless facility, or utility pole for collocation of a small wireless facility placed or maintained in the public rights-of-way or on the City's property including a City utility pole as a result of registrant's collocation on a City utility pole. A registrant shall reimburse the City for taxes paid by the City as a result of registrant's facilities being placed or maintained in the public rights-of-way or on a City owned utility pole. 
(33)  Airport Airspace. A structure granted a permit and installed pursuant to this article shall comply with F.S. ch. 333, and federal regulations pertaining to airport airspace protections. 
(34)  Tree Protection. Trees may not be damaged or removed during placement or maintenance of small wireless facilities, utility poles, or wireless support structures in the public rights-of-way. Tree removal is not permitted within the public rights-of-way to increase signal strength or provide a line-of-sight. Landscaping may only be damaged or removed pursuant to a City permit during placement or maintenance of small wireless facilities, utility poles, or wireless support structures. The City will require that any landscaping so removed be replaced in accordance with the approved restoration plan. 
(Ord. No. 18-1485, § 3, 7-23-18) 
Sec. 68-160. - Placement of new utility poles or wireless support structure. 
(a)  The placing of any new utility pole, wireless support structure, or other above-ground structure for the collocation of a small wireless facility or micro wireless facility is subject to the approval of the City Engineer and these structures shall be erected under the supervision of the City Engineer or his designee. No new utility pole, wireless support structure, or other above-ground structure shall be allowed in the public rights-of-way unless the applicant demonstrates and the City Engineer determines that no existing structure, or alternative technology (that does not require the placement of a new structure in a public rights-of-way) can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna or other communication facility. Such a demonstration by the applicant shall not give rise to a right to locate the proposed facility within the public rights-of-way or in any way guarantee City approval of such. An applicant shall submit information requested by the City Engineer related to the availability of suitable existing structures or alternative technology. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing structure or alternative technology can accommodate the applicant's proposed communications facility may consist of, but is not limited to, the following factors to be considered by the City Engineer: 
(1)  No existing structures are located within the geographic area which would meet applicant's engineering requirements. 
(2)  Existing structures are not of sufficient height to meet applicant's engineering requirements, which shall be demonstrated by, at minimum, propagation and coverage maps. 
(3)  Existing structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna or other communications facility and related equipment. 
(4)  The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing structures, or the antenna on the existing structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna. 
(5)  The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share an existing structure or to adapt an existing structure for sharing are unreasonable. 
(6)  The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting factors that render existing structures unsuitable. 
(7)  The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that does not require the use of new structures, such as cable microcell network using multiple low-powered transmitters/receivers attached to wire line system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new structure or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology unsuitable. 
(b)  If approved, no such utility pole or other above-ground structure shall be placed in any gutter or drainage area and must be located behind the curb. In areas of the City where either electric utility wires or other communications facilities are above ground and such facilities are moved, either voluntarily or at the direction of the City, to a new utility pole or other above-ground structure, the communications services provider or wireless infrastructure provider shall likewise move all its above-ground facilities on such utility poles or structures to such new utility pole or structure within 30 days after receipt of written notice from either the City or the owner of the new utility pole or structure, without cost to the City. 
(Ord. No. 18-1485, § 3, 7-23-18) 
Sec. 68-161. - Notice of transfer, sale or assignment of assets in public rights-of-way. 
    If a communications services provider transfers, sells or assigns its assets located in the public rights-of-way incident to a transfer, sale or assignment of the communications services provider's assets, the transferee, buyer or assignee shall be obligated to comply with the terms of this article. Written notice of any such transfer, sale or assignment shall be provided by such communications services provider to the City within 30 days after the effective date of the transfer, sale or assignment. If the transferee, buyer or assignee is a current registrant, then the transferee, buyer or assignee is not required to re-register. If the transferee, buyer or assignee is not a current registrant, then the transferee, buyer or assignee shall register as provided in Section 68-155 within 60 days of the transfer, sale or assignment. If any applications for a permit are pending under the communications services provider's name as of the date the City receives written notice of the transfer, sale, or assignment, then the City shall consider the transferee, buyer or assignee as the new applicant unless otherwise notified by the communications services provider. If any permit applications are pending under the registrant's name as of the date the City receives written notice of the transfer, sale, or assignment, then the City shall consider the transferee, buyer or assignee as the new applicant unless otherwise notified by the registrant. 
(Ord. No. 18-1485, § 3, 7-23-18) 
Sec. 68-162. - Duty to notify City of resellers; conditional use of public rights-of-way. 
    Within 30 days of any registered communications services provider using its facilities to carry the communication services of any reseller, such communications services provider shall notify the City of the name and address of such reseller. A reseller's lease, interconnection or other use of facilities belonging to a communications services provider duly registered in accordance with Section 68-155 and properly permitted to place or maintain its facilities in the public rights-of-way, does not, and shall not, afford such reseller any right, claim or cause of action to impede the lawful exercise of the City's rights or police powers, including, but not limited to, requiring the registered communications services provider to remove such facilities from the public rights-of-way. 
(Ord. No. 18-1485, § 3, 7-23-18)

(Ord. No. 18-1485, § 3, 7-23-18) 
Sec. 68-164. - Appeals. 
    Final, written decisions of the City Manager or City Engineer, or designee, denying, or suspending a permit, denying an application for a registration or denying an application for renewal of a registration are subject to appeal. An appeal must be filed with the City Clerk within 30 days of the date of the final, written decision to be appealed. Any appeal not filed in a timely manner shall be waived. The City Commission shall hear the appeal as set forth in the City Code. The hearing shall occur within 30 days of the receipt of the appeal, unless waived by the registrant, and a written decision shall be rendered within 20 days of the hearing. Upon correction of the grounds that gave rise to a suspension or denial, the suspension or denial shall be lifted (the same does not apply to the revocation of a permit). 
(Ord. No. 18-1485, § 3, 7-23-18) 
Sec. 68-165. - Involuntary termination of registration. 
(a)  The City may terminate a registration if: 
(1)  A federal or Florida authority suspends, denies, or revokes a registrant's certification or license to provide Communications Services; 
(2)  The registrant's placement or maintenance of a Communications Facility in the Public Rights-of-Way presents an extraordinary danger to the general public or other users of the Public Rights-of-Way and the registrant fails to remedy the danger promptly after receipt of written notice; or 
(3)  The registrant ceases to use all of its Communications Facilities in Public Rights-of-Way and has not complied with Section 68-173 of this Article. 
(4)  The communications services provider fails to comply with any of the rules, regulations or general conditions set forth in herein. 
(b)  Prior to termination of a registration, the registrant shall be notified by the City Engineer in writing, setting forth all matters pertinent to the proposed termination action, including which of [subsections] (1) through (4) above is applicable as the reason therefore, and describing the proposed action of the City with respect thereto. The registrant shall have 30 days after receipt of such notice within which to address or eliminate the reason or within which to present a plan, satisfactory to the City Engineer, to accomplish the same. If not eliminated or if the plan is rejected, the City Engineer shall provide written notice of such rejection to the registrant within 15 days of receipt of the plan. A registrant shall be notified by written notice of any decision by the City Manager or designee to terminate registration. Such written notice shall be sent within seven days after the decision. A final determination to terminate may be appealed in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 68-164. 
(c)  In the event of termination, the former registrant shall: (a) notify the City of the assumption or anticipated assumption by another registrant of ownership of the communications services provider's communications facilities in public rights-of-way; or (b) provide the City with an acceptable plan for disposition of its communications facilities in the public rights-of-way. If a communications services provider fails to comply with this subsection (c), which determination of non-compliance is subject to appeal as provided in Section 68-164, the City may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including but not limited to taking possession of the facilities where another person has not assumed the ownership or physical control of the facilities; or requiring the communications services provider within 90 days of the termination, or such longer period as may be agreed to by the communications services provider, to remove some or all of the facilities from the public rights-of-way and restore the public rights-of-way to its original condition before the removal. 
(d)  In any event, a terminated registrant shall take such steps as are necessary to render safe every portion of the communications facilities remaining in the public rights-of-way of the City. 
(e)  In the event of termination of a registration, this section does not authorize the City to cause the removal of communications facilities used to provide another service for which the registrant or another person who owns or exercises physical control over the facilities holds a valid certification or license with the governing federal or state agency, if required for provision of such service, and who is registered with the City, if required. 
(f)  The City's right to terminate a registration shall be in addition to all other rights of the City, whether reserved in this article, or authorized by other law. No action, proceeding or exercise of the right to terminate registration will affect or preclude any other right the City may have.

(d)  Nothing in this section shall be construed or interpreted as (a) denying to either party any remedy or defense available to such party under the laws of the State of Florida; or (b) as a waiver of sovereign immunity beyond the waiver provided in F.S. § 768.28, as it may be amended. 
(e)  The indemnification requirements shall survive and be in effect after the termination or cancellation of a registration. 
(Ord. No. 18-1485, § 3, 7-23-18) 
Sec. 68-169. - Construction bond. 
(a)  Prior to the City issuing a permit where the work under the permit will require restoration of public rights-of-way, the communications services provider or the contractor performing such work on its behalf must obtain, pay for and file with the City a construction bond. The construction bond must serve to guarantee the timeliness and quality of the construction and restoration work, and secure and enable the City to recover, all costs related to the restoration of the public rights-of-way in the event the communications services provider or its contractor fails to make such restoration to the City's satisfaction or causes damage to the public rights-of-way during construction. The construction bond must name the City as obligee and be in the face amount of $15,000.00 conditioned upon the full and faithful completion of construction and restoration of the public rights-of-way to its original condition. Six months following completion and inspection of the restoration of the public rights-of-way satisfactory to the City Engineer, the communications services provider or its contractor, as the case may be, may reduce the face amount of the construction bond to $5,000.00 and, thereafter, may allow the bond to lapse in accordance with its terms. However, for any subsequent work in the public rights-of-way, the communications services provider or its contractor will be required to replenish any existing construction bond or provide a new construction bond in the face amount of $15,000.00. The construction bond shall be in a form acceptable to the City Attorney and must be issued by a surety having a rating reasonably acceptable to the City Engineer and authorized by the Florida Department of Insurance to issue surety bonds in this State. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a construction bond hereunder may only be required to the extent that the cost of the restoration exceeds the amount recoverable against the Security Fund as provided in Section 68-170. 
(b)  The construction bond must be issued as non-cancelable and be for a term of not less than 12 months. In the event the term of any construction bond expires, or is reasonably expected to expire, prior to the completion of construction, restoration and City inspection, the communications services provider, or the contractor acting on its behalf, shall immediately obtain, pay for, and file with the City a replacement bond. 
(c)  The City's requirement of a construction bond is not in lieu of any additional bonds that may be required under this Article or through the permitting process. The City's right to recover under the construction bond shall be in addition to all other rights of the City, whether reserved in this article, or authorized by other law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to the construction bond will affect or preclude any other right the City may have. 
(Ord. No. 18-1485, § 3, 7-23-18) 
Sec. 68-170. - Security fund. 
    At or prior to the time a communications services provider receives its first permit to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way after the effective date of this article, every communications services provider shall make a $25,000.00 cash deposit, or shall file with the City an irrevocable letter of credit or acceptable equivalent in the same amount, which shall serve, and be referred to, as the "Security Fund." The Security Fund shall be conditioned upon the full and faithful compliance with and performance by the communications services provider of all requirements, duties and obligations imposed by the provisions of the City of Casselberry Communications Right-of-Way Ordinance at all times. The letter of credit shall be in a form and issued by an institution acceptable to the City's Chief Financial Officer. Should the City draw upon the Security Fund, it shall promptly notify the communications services provider, and the communications Services Provider shall promptly restore the cash deposit or letter of credit to the full amount. The Security Fund shall be maintained until the later of (a) the effective date of transfer, sale or assignment by the communications services provider of all its facilities in the public rights-of-way, (b) 12 months after the removal or abandonment by the communications services provider of all of its facilities in the public rights-of-way or (c) six months after the termination of registration, including any appeals undertaken pursuant to Section 68-164 herein. Upon the later of these events the cash deposit will be returned without interest or the letter of credit may be cancelled. In the event a communications services provider fails to perform any requirement, duty or obligation imposed upon it by the provisions of this article, there shall be recoverable, jointly and severally from the Security Fund, any damages or loss suffered by the City as a result, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification or cost of removal, relocation or abandonment of any facilities in the public rights-of-way, plus a reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees, up to the full amount of the Security Fund. 
(Ord. No. 18-1485, § 3, 7-23-18) 
Sec. 68-171. - Performance bond. 
(a)  Before any communications services provider is permitted to begin the placement or maintenance of an initial build, any substantial rebuild, upgrade or extension of its communications system, or when construction plans show that there would be at least 1,000 feet of open trenching in the public rights-of-way at any given time, the communications services provider is required to obtain, pay for, and file with the City a performance bond. The performance bond must name the City as obligee and be in the face amount of $250,000.00 conditioned upon the full and faithful compliance by the communications services provider with all requirements, duties and obligations imposed by the provisions of the City of Casselberry Communications Rights-of-Way Ordinance, during, and through completion of, the placement or maintenance project. The performance bond shall be in a form acceptable to the City Attorney and must be issued by a surety having a rating reasonably acceptable to the City Engineer and authorized by the Florida Department of Insurance to issue performance bonds in the State of Florida. 
(b)  The performance bond must be issued as non-cancelable and be for a term consistent with the reasonably expected duration of the particular placement or maintenance project (including restoration and City inspection), but in no event less than 18 months. In the event the term of any performance bond expires, or is reasonably expected to expire, prior to the completion of such placement or maintenance project, including restoration and City inspection, the communications services provider shall immediately obtain, pay for, and file with the City a replacement bond. 
(c)  The City's requirement of a performance bond is not in lieu of any additional bonds that may be required under this article or through the permitting process. The City's right to recover under the performance bond shall be in addition to all other rights of the City, whether reserved in this article, or authorized by other law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to the performance bond will affect or preclude any other right the City may have. Any proceeds recovered under the performance bond may be used to reimburse the City for such additional expenses as may be incurred by the City as a result of the communications services provider's failure to comply with the responsibilities imposed by this article, including, but not limited to, attorney's fees and costs of any action or proceeding, and the cost of removal or abandonment of any property. 
(Ord. No. 18-1485, § 3, 7-23-18) 
Sec. 68-172. - Enforcement remedies. 
(a)  A communications services provider's failure to comply with provisions of this article shall constitute a violation of this article and shall subject the communications services provider to the code enforcement provisions and procedures as provided in Article III, of Chapter 2 of the City's Code of Ordinances. In addition, violation of this article may be punishable as provided in F.S. § 162.22. 
(b)  No provision of this article shall be deemed to bar the right of the City to seek or obtain judicial relief from a violation of any provisions of this article, the registration provisions, or any rule, regulation, or general condition provided for hereunder, whether administratively, judicially or both. Neither the existence of other remedies identified in this article nor the exercise thereof shall be deemed to bar or otherwise limit the right of the City to recover fines, penalties, or monetary damages (except where liquidated damages are otherwise prescribed) for such violation by the communications services provider. The remedies available to the City shall be cumulative and in addition to any other remedies provided by law or equity. The laws of the State of Florida shall govern with respect to any proceeding in law or equity pertaining to the enforcement of this article or any cause or action arising out of or in connection herewith. 
(c)  In any proceeding before the City Commission where there exists an issue with respect to a communications services provider's performance of its obligations pursuant to this article, the communications services provider shall be given the opportunity to provide such information as it may have concerning its compliance with the terms and conditions of this article. The City may find a communications services provider that does not demonstrate compliance with the terms and conditions of this article in default and apply any appropriate remedy or remedies as authorized by this article. In determining which remedy is appropriate, the City Commission shall take into consideration the nature of the violation, the person bearing the impact of the violation, the nature of the remedy required in order to prevent further violations, and such other matters as the City Commission determines are appropriate to the public interest. 
(d)  Failure of the City to enforce any requirements of this article shall not constitute a waiver of the City right to enforce that violation or subsequent violations of the same type or to seek appropriate enforcement remedies. 
(Ord. No. 18-1485, § 3, 7-23-18) 
Sec. 68-173. - Abandonment of a communications facility. 
(a)  Upon abandonment of a communications facility owned by a communications services provider in the public rights-of-way, the communications services provider shall notify the City within 60 days. 
(b)  The City may direct the communications services provider, by written notice, to remove all or any portion of such abandoned facility at the communications services provider's sole expense if the City determines that the abandoned facility's presence interferes with the public health, safety or welfare, which shall include, but shall not be limited to, a determination that such facility: (1) compromises safety at any time for any public rights-of-way user; (2) compromises the safety of other persons performing placement or maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way; (3) prevents another person from locating facilities in the area of public rights-of-way where the abandoned facility is located, when other alternative locations are not reasonably available; or (4) creates a maintenance condition that is disruptive to the use of the public rights-of-way's use. In the event of (2), the City may require the third Person to coordinate with the communications services provider that owns the existing facility for joint removal and placement, where agreed to by the registrant. 
(c)  In the event that the City does not direct the removal of the abandoned facility, the communications services provider, by its notice of abandonment to the City, shall be deemed to consent to the alteration or removal of all or any portion of the Facility by the City or another person at such third party's cost. 
(d)  If the communications services provider fails to remove all or any portion of an abandoned facility as directed by the City within the timer period specified in the written notice, which time period must be reasonable under the circumstances, the City may perform such removal and charge the cost of the removal against the communications services provider. 
(Ord. No. 18-1485, § 3, 7-23-18) 
Sec. 68-174. - Force majeure. 
    In the event a communications services provider's performance of or compliance with any of the provisions of this article is prevented by a cause or event not within the communications services provider's control, such inability to perform or comply shall be deemed excused and no penalties or sanctions shall be imposed as a result; provided, however, that such communications services provider uses all practicable means to expeditiously cure or correct any such inability to perform or comply. For purposes of this article, causes or events not within a communications services provider's control shall include, without limitation, acts of God, floods, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, fires and other natural disasters, acts of public enemies, riots or civil disturbances, sabotage, strikes and restraints imposed by order of a governmental agency or court. Causes or events within communications services Provider's control, and thus not falling within this Section, shall include, without limitation, Communications Services Provider's financial inability to perform or comply, economic hardship, and misfeasance, malfeasance or nonfeasance by any of Communications Services Provider's directors, officers, employees, contractors or agents. 
(Ord. No. 18-1485, § 3, 7-23-18) 
Sec. 68-175. - Fees applicable to those not subject to communications services tax. 
    While the Florida Legislature has prohibited municipalities from requiring providers of communications services who have registered with the Florida Department of Revenue from having to enter into franchise agreements or license arrangements as a condition to placing or maintaining communications facilities in the public rights-of-way, the City expressly reserves the right to require the payment of consideration or regulatory fees by persons using or occupying the public rights-of-way in other capacities. The City reserves the right to require such payments based on the type of user and to the extent as follows: 
(1)  Dealer. Except as provided elsewhere, a communications services provider who meets the definition of Dealer as set forth in this article and who has registered in accordance with Section 68-155 is not required to enter into a franchise agreement or license arrangement with the City as a condition to placing or maintaining communications facilities in the public rights-of-way, nor is a dealer required to make payment of any franchise fees, license fees or other user fees to the City as consideration for the use or occupancy of the public rights-of-way for the provision of communication services. 
(2)  Pass-Through Provider and Pass-Through Facilities. A communications services provider who meets the definition of pass-through provider as set forth in this article and who is not subject to the City of Casselberry's Local Communications Services Tax imposed pursuant to F.S. §§ 202.19 and 202.20, shall pay the City the maximum annual amount allowed under F.S. § 337.401(6)(b), as amended. For purposes of calculating payments hereunder, each separate pole or tower installed or maintained by a pass-through provider for purposes of supporting antennas for other over-the-air radio transmission or reception equipment in the public rights-of-way shall comprise a separate communications facility subject to assessment of a separate permit fee in the amount of $500.00 per linear mile, or portion thereof, up to the maximum amount allowed under F.S. § 337.401(6)(b), whichever is higher. The annual amount referred to above shall be due and payable on October 1 of every year beginning on October 1, 2017. Fees not paid within ten days after the due date shall bear interest at the rate of one percent per month from the date due until paid. The acceptance of any payment required hereunder by the City shall not be construed as an acknowledgment that the amount paid is the correct amount due, nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim which the City may have for additional sums due and payable or authorization to install any facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
(3)  Other Persons. All other persons, except government, are required to pay the City, as consideration for the use or occupancy of the public rights-of-way for the placement or maintenance of communications facilities, an amount based on and in accordance with the City Code. 
(4)  Government. A government is not required to pay the City consideration for the use or occupancy of the public rights-of-way for the placement or maintenance of communications facilities, unless such facilities are being used by such government or a communications services provider, including resellers, to offer or provide communication services other than for such government's internal non-commercial use, in which event the government, where not subject to the City of Casselberry's Local Communications Services Tax imposed pursuant to F.S. §§ 202.19 and 202.20, is required to pay the City, as consideration for the use or occupancy of the public rights-of-way by or through its facilities an amount based on and in accordance with the City Code or such other amount or rate of compensation as mutually agreed to in writing by the government and the City.

Sec. 68-176. - Reservation of rights and remedies. 
(a)  The City hereby expressly reserves all of the following rights: 
(1)  To exercise its municipal home rule powers, now or hereafter, to the fullest extent allowed by law with regard to the access, use and regulation of the public rights-of-way. 
(2)  To amend this article as it shall find necessary in the lawful exercise of its municipal authority and police powers. 
(3)  To adopt or enact by resolution or ordinance, in addition to the provisions contained herein and in any existing applicable ordinances, such additional reasonable regulations as the City Commission finds necessary in the exercise of the City's police powers. 
(4)  To exercise the power of eminent domain, consistent with applicable federal and state law, to acquire property that may include that property owned or leased by a communications services provider. 
(5)  As and when deemed necessary by the City Commission to be in the interest of the City or its residents, to abandon portions of the public rights-of-way within the proper exercise of its municipal authority and without notice to or the consent of any communications services provider. The City shall not be responsible for any costs, damages, loss or other expense to the communications services provider as a result of the City's abandonment of any public rights-of-way. 
(6)  To place and maintain, and permit to be placed or maintained, sewer, gas, water, electric, storm drainage, communications, and other types of facilities, cables or conduit, and to do, and to permit to be done any underground and overhead installation or improvement that may be deemed necessary or proper by the City in the public rights-of-way occupied by any communications services provider. 
(7)  Without limitation, to alter, change, or cause to be changed, the grading, installation, relocation, or width of any public rights-of-way within the limits of the City and within said limits as same may from time to time be altered. 
(8)  To require a reseller to register in accordance with Section 68-155 to the extent such reseller wants the right to place or maintain facilities in the public rights-of-way. Any person using or leasing facilities owned by a registered communications services provider is not, therefore, entitled to any rights to place or maintain communications facilities in the public rights-of-way, unless such person themselves registers with the City. 
(b)  This article shall be applicable to all communications facilities placed in the public rights-of-way on or after the effective date of this article and shall apply to all existing communications facilities in the public rights-of-way prior to the effective date of this article, to the full extent permitted by state and federal law. 
(c)  The adoption of this article is not intended to affect any rights or defenses of the City or a communications service provider under any existing franchise, license or other agreements with a communications services provider. 
(d)  Nothing in this article shall affect the remedies the City or the communications services provider has available under applicable law. 
(e)  Any person who uses the communications facilities of a communications services provider, other than the communications services provider that owns the facilities, shall not be entitled to any rights to place or maintain such facilities in excess of the rights of the registrant that places or maintains the facilities. 
(f)  If provisions of this article conflict with any other provision of the City Code of Ordinances, or the Unified Land Development Regulations, the more restrictive provisions shall govern. 
(Ord. No. 18-1485, § 3, 7-23-18) 
Sec. 68-177. - Special provisions for certain eligible facilities modifications. 
    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Article, the City shall not deny any eligible facilities request for a modification to an existing tower or base station which does not substantially change the physical dimensions of such tower or base station provided the procedure and requirements set forth in Section 2-7.36(D), of the Unified Land Development Regulations, are satisfied. Except as may otherwise be provided in this article, and not withstanding any other provisions in the City Code, the provisions of Section 2-7.36(D), of the Unified Land Development Regulations, shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for review and approval of an eligible facilities request which the applicant asserts is subject to review under Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 ("Spectrum Act") as interpreted by the FCC Acceleration of Broadband Deployment Report and Order dated October 21, 2014. To the extent that other provisions of the City Code establish a parallel process for review and approval of a project application for a proposed eligible facilities request, the provisions of Section 2-7.26(D) shall control. In the event that an application for a project includes a proposal to modify an eligible support structure, and the applicant does not assert in the application that the proposal is subject to review under the Spectrum Act, such proposal shall not be subject to review under Section 2-7.26(D) and may be subject to review under other applicable provisions of the City Code. 
(Ord. No. 18-1485, § 3, 7-23-18) 
Sec. 68-178. - Compliance with state and federal regulations; preemption. 
    In implementing this Article and the provisions set forth herein, the City shall comply with applicable state and federal regulations, and the provisions of this Article shall be given force to the maximum amount and greatest extent permissible under state and federal law. Except as authorized pursuant to state and federal law, in the event of any conflict between the terms of this article and state or federal law, state and federal law shall control. In the event any provision of this Article is specifically preempted, or judicially determined to be preempted by state or federal law, then the preempted provision shall automatically be deemed null and void and the superseding provision of state or federal law shall prevail.

Evidence may include, but is not limited to, factors such as: Vehicle being wrecked, inoperative as evidenced by vegetation underneath as high as the vehicle body or frame, refuse or debris collected underneath or the vehicle being used solely for storage purposes, if it is partially dismantled, having no engine, transmission, or other major and visible sections, having major and visible parts which are dismantled, having no valid license tag, or being in any physical state rendering it inoperable or unsightly to the neighborhood. If the primary apparent evidence of neglect or abandonment is the lack of a valid tag or vegetation growing under vehicle, then the inspector shall use his training and experience to determine whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the vehicle is in a state of evident disuse, neglect, or abandonment. A vehicle will be considered abandoned or derelict if it is an evident state of extended disuse or neglect. 
(e)  Interpretation of this requirement. Nothing in this Section shall be construed as permitting the disassembling, tearing down or scrapping of a vehicle, or to permit one vehicle to be scavenged or stripped for sections for use on another vehicle.

(f)  Responsibility for compliance. The owner, agent and/or tenant of the property on which the violation occurs and the owner of the disabled vehicle shall be jointly and individually responsible for compliance with the requirements of this Section. 
(g)  Enforcement. When a disabled or abandoned vehicle is found to be in violation of this Section: 
(1)  The Code Enforcement Officer shall place a written notice on the vehicle indicating that it is in violation of this Section and that it must be removed within ten calendar days or it will be subject to removal by the City. The Code Inspector shall make every reasonable attempt to ascertain the owner of the vehicle and the owner of the property and shall notify such owner(s) with a written notice delivered by mail or personal service at their current address, last known address, or the address appearing on the certificate of title for the vehicle. 
(2)  Within the ten calendar-day period specified in the notice, the owner of the vehicle or the owner of the property, or an authorized agent may appeal, in writing, to the administrative official selected or appointed by the City Manager to administer code enforcement in the City. 
(3)  The property or vehicle owner(s) may appeal, in writing, the administrative official's final decision to the Code Enforcement Board for determination as to whether the abandoned or derelict vehicle is subject to removal. 
(4)  If no written appeal is made and the disabled vehicle remains in violation after the ten calendar-day period, the administrative official shall call such vehicle to be removed immediately to a storage facility approved by the City and thereafter disposed of in compliance with applicable State law or City ordinance. 
(5)  The authorization in this Section for the towing of abandoned and disabled vehicles shall not be construed so as to negate the authority of the Code Enforcement Board to hear and adjudicate appropriate cases. 
(h)  Vehicles on public property. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, all vehicles which are located on public property shall be towed and disposed of in accordance with the notice and sale requirements of F.S. ch. 705, as revised in the 1987 legislative session. To the extent that this Section conflicts with any portion of F.S. ch. 705, the latter shall control as to any vehicles located on public property.

(b)  At the trial of any case involving an alleged violation of any statute or ordinance governing the parking, stopping or standing of a vehicle in which the owner of the vehicle is being tried under this Chapter, it shall be sufficient evidence to establish the name of the registered owner of the vehicle if a police officer shall state on oath that he has made inquiry of the state department of highway safety and motor vehicles, through standard law enforcement channels, and has been advised by it of the identity of the registered owner at the time of the alleged offense. 
(c)  Notwithstanding the rebuttability of the presumption provided for in Subsections (a) and (b) of this Section, the registered owner of a vehicle when the vehicle is parked, stopped or standing in violation of any state statute or City ordinance is hereby declared to be directly responsible to the City for payment of the fine for the vehicle being so parked or left stopped or standing.

(Code 1982, § 71.017) 
Sec. 82-97. - Installation of multiway stop signs. 
(a)  Arterial and collector roads. 
(1)  Multiway stop signs on arterial and collector roads shall be installed in accordance with the state department of transportation publication titled "Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices." 
(2)  The multiway stop installation is useful as a safety measure at some locations. It should ordinarily be used only where the volume of traffic on the intersection roads is approximately equal. A traffic control signal is more satisfactory for an intersection with a heavy volume of traffic. 
(3)  Multiway stop signs shall not be installed unless one or more of the following conditions are met: 
a.  Where traffic signals are warranted and urgently needed, the multiway stop is an interim measure that can be installed quickly to control traffic while arrangements are being made for the signal installation. 
b.  Multiway stop signs may be installed where an accident problem exists, as indicated by the occurrence of five or more reported accidents of a type susceptible of correction by a multiway stop installation in a 12-month period. Such accidents include right and left turn collisions, as well as right-angle collisions. 
(4)  Minimum traffic volumes are as follows: 
a.  The total vehicular volume entering the intersection from all approaches must average at least 500 vehicles per hour for any eight hours of an average day; and 
b.  The combined vehicular and pedestrian volume from the minor street or highway must average at least 200 units per hour for the same eight hours, with an average delay to minor-street vehicular traffic of at least 30 seconds per vehicle during the maximum hour. 
When the 85-percentile approach speed of the major-street traffic exceeds 40 miles per hour, the minimum vehicular volume warrant is 70 percent of the requirements set out in Subsections a. and b. of this Subsection. 
(b)  Local feeder roads. Signs may be installed for local feeder roads as follows: 
(1)  At an intersection that is primary to the area. 
(2)  Where there is a 60-40 percent volume split for a four-way intersection. 
(3)  Where there is a 75-25 percent volume split for a three-way intersection. 
(4)  Where there are three or more correctable accidents in one year. 
Other parameters such as pedestrians, site visibility, etc., should also be considered prior to arriving at a final decision pertaining to the installation of a multiway stop. 
(c)  Use generally. Engineering judgment should be carefully exercised in applying these guidelines to avoid the excessive use of this highly restrictive control. In addition, all existing multiway stop controlled intersections should be periodically reviewed to determine if another type of control would be more appropriate.

Sec. 86-2. - Administration. 
    Except as otherwise provided herein, the Director of Public Works shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this Article. Any powers granted to or duties imposed upon the Director may be delegated by the Director to other City personnel. 
Sec. 86-3. - Agreement to defer system development charges and tapping fees or charges. 
(a)  Generally. Any applicant may enter into a Fee Deferral Agreement with the City designed to allow the applicant to defer payment of water system development charges, water tapping fees, sewer development charges, or sewer tapping fees, until such time that the applicant is ready to apply for Certificate of Occupancy. 
(b)  Procedure. To initiate eligibility review, the applicant must submit together with the application for a building permit, an Application for Fee Deferral Agreement, including any documentation supporting the request for fee deferral and an administrative fee that may be determined by the City Commission by resolution. Upon receiving approval from the City Manager, the proposed Fee Deferral Agreement must be presented to the City Commission for approval. Any such Fee Deferral Agreement may provide for execution by mortgagees, lienholders, or contract purchasers, in addition to the landowner, at the discretion of the City, and must be recorded in the Official Records of the County. 
(c)  Terms. The Fee Deferral Agreement will set forth the schedule and method for payment of the system development charges, tapping fees or charges, which will apply in lieu of the requirements for payment of the system development charges, tapping fees and charges set forth in Sections 86-186 and 86-68, respectively, and the form of security that the applicant will provide. The Fee Deferral Agreement must include provisions setting forth the total unpaid amount of the system development charges, tapping fees or charges that remains outstanding, together with an acknowledgement that the balance of the unpaid charges must be paid in full prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy. The Fee Deferral Agreement may provide for the fees to rise with inflation, when the City Commission finds the development may encounter delays. The Fee Deferral Agreement, once recorded in the Official Records, will constitute a lien on the property in question. 
(d)  Security. The Fee Deferral Agreement may include security that the applicant has provided to ensure payment of the system development charges, tapping fees and charges, which security may include one of the following forms, at the City's discretion: 
(1)  Cash bond equal to 25 percent of the total amount of the system development charges, tapping fees or charges, as calculated at the time of permit application; or 
(2)  An immediately funded escrow account in an amount determined by the City.

(b)  The debt service for reserved sewer capacity is currently, on the effective date of the ordinance from which this Section is derived, $0.71 per 1,000 gallons of capacity. Debt service for reserved sewer capacity shall be collected hereafter at $0.71 per 1,000 gallons or any part thereof reserved, and collection at such figure shall continue until legislatively amended by the City. However, the debt service is adjustable as needed. Accordingly, the City Commission as needed, by resolution, hereafter adjust the debt service to be paid by developers or landowners on reserved capacity, to reflect the actual debt service assessed to the City for each gallon of capacity reserved. 
(c)  The developer's agreement between the City and developer or landowner shall provide that, in order for a developer or landowner to maintain a continuing reservation of sewer capacity, the developer or landowner shall annually pay the total adjusted debt service for the capacity reserved for the developer's or landowner's benefit. Failure to pay the assessed debt service within 15 days shall result in a forfeiture of the reserved capacity, and the reserved capacity shall be released for allocation elsewhere in the City.

    When the Director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of Article II, Sewers, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
(Ord. No. 01-1042, § 1, 11-26-01) 
Sec. 86-61. - Affirmative defenses to discharge violations. 
(a)  Upset. 
(1)  For the purposes of this Section, "upset" means an exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation. 
(2)  An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (3) below, are met. 
(3)  A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that: 
a.  An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset; 
b.  The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 
c.  The user has submitted the following information to the Director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset. If this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days. 
1.  A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; 
2.  The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
4.  In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 
5.  Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 
6.  Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
(b)  Prohibited Discharge Standards. 
(1)  A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the general and specific prohibitions in Section 86-112 of this Article if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
a.  A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 
b.  No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the City was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements. 
(c)  Bypass. 
(1)  A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this Section. 
(2)  If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the Director at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 
(3)  A user shall submit oral notice to the Director of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(4)  Bypass is prohibited, and the Director may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless 
a.  Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There was no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and 
c.  The user submitted notices as required under Subsection (3) of this Section. 
(5)  The Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the Director determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (4) a., b. and c. of this Section.

Sec. 86-68. - System development charge and tapping fee. 
(a)  Sewer system development charge established; purpose. There is hereby established a sewer charge of $6.62 per gallon, which shall be paid by the user prior to hookup, or as specified by agreement, pursuant to Section 86-3, for replacing equivalent unit capacity at the City's sewage treatment plant or at Iron Bridge regional sewage treatment plant. Such fee shall be modified as required by the City Commission to reflect costs for providing sewer capacity to a new user. The schedule set out in this Section shall be used to determine the fees for providing connection to interceptor lines, master lift and pumping stations, force mains, treatment facilities and other required sewer facilities inside and outside the corporate limits of the City, and for retention of maximum capacity and performance of the municipal sewer system. 
(1)  System development charge. The following schedule shall be used to determine the sewer system development charge for customers within the City: 
Description ERU (gpd) Sewer System Development Charge [*] Residential: Single-family 200 $1,324.00/unit Multi-family 150 993.00/unit Commercial/Non-Residential: ?" x 3/4" Meter 200 $1,324.00/meter 1" Meter 500 3,310.00/meter 1 1/2" Meter 1,000 6,620.00/meter 2" Meter 1,600 10,592.00/meter 3" Meter 3,000 19,860.00/meter 4" Meter 5,000 33,100.00/meter 6" Meter 10,000 66,200.00/meter 8" Meter 16,000 105,920.00/meter 10" Meter 25,000 165,500.00/meter [*] Amounts based on an adopted fee of $6.62 per gallon of capacity calculated on an average daily flow basis effective January 1, 2018.  
 Notes: 
1.  One ERU factor is equivalent to 200 gallons per day calculated on an average daily flow basis. 
2.  The fees shown above reflect the minimum system development charges to be applied per unit or per meter size; however, the City may elect to charge a system development charge equal to the greater of: 1) the minimum fee per unit or meter size; or 2) an alternative method based on the total equivalent residential unit (ERU) value determined by multiplying the number of fixture units, as published in the Southern Standard Plumbing Code, by 25, and then dividing that numerator by 200 (gallons per day per ERU), then multiplying by $1,324.00. 
Total ERU Value = Number of fixture units x 25 / 200 
For example, the Southern Standard Plumbing Code indicates that a kitchen sink has a fixture unit value of 2. To determine the total fee, take the 2, multiply by 25, then divide by 200, then multiply by $1,324.00: 
2 x 25 / 200 × $1,324 = $331.00 
3.  For industrial facilities or other facilities where the schedule or formula set out in this Subsection is not applicable, the equivalent ERUs and flows shall be evaluated on an individual basis to determine the sewer system development charges. 
(2)  Tapping fee. There is hereby established a one-time tapping fee as set forth below, for all connections made to the sewer system. The City reserves the right to defer tapping fees if it is deemed unnecessary by the Director of Public Works. 
Sewer Lateral 
Diameter-4" $2,540.00 Sewer Lateral 
Diameter-6" $2,560.00  
(b)  Customers outside City. The sewer system development charges and tapping fees shown in Subsection (a) of this Section are for service within the City limits. For service outside the City, the sewer system development charge and tapping fees for service within the City limits shall be multiplied by a variable factor as established in the table set forth below: 
Accounts for Service Outside of City Limits Fiscal Year 2017-18 Fiscal Year 2018-19 Fiscal Year 2019-20 Fiscal Year 2020-21 Fiscal Year 2021-22 System Development Charges/Multiplication Factor(*) 1.225 1.2 1.175 1.15 1.125 Tapping Fees/Multiplication Factor (**) 1.225 1.2 1.175 1.15 1.125  
* Reflects the system development charges effective January 1, 2018 of Fiscal Year 2017-18 and October 1 of each subsequent Fiscal Year. 
** Reflects the tapping fees effective October 1, 2017 of Fiscal Year 2017-18 and October 1 of each subsequent Fiscal Year. 
_____
(c)  Septic tank exception to sewer system development charges. All properties in the service area which are served by septic tank service on May 26, 1994, shall retain the privilege to pay the one-time charge per sewer unit served of $450.00 per ERU (in-City) or $563.00 per ERU (outside-City) at any time within one year from the date that sewer service is available at the site as verified and recorded in the office of the City Department of Public Works in lieu of the required sewer system development charges. All affected property owners will be notified when sewer becomes available and as to the date of beginning of the one-year period. Those exercising this privilege shall pay regular sewer availability charges and commodity charges upon the next regular billing cycle after application, and thereafter. 
(d)  Additional costs: 
(1)  In City. All costs germane to the construction, installation and maintenance of the sewer facility from the customer's building to the customer's property line shall be paid by the property owner. 
(2)  Outside City-Contiguous. If the property is contiguous to the City limits, the applicant shall annex the property into the City. The property owner shall then be responsible for those cost as "in-City," above. 
(3)  Outside City-Not contiguous. All costs germane to the construction, installation and maintenance of the sewer facility from the customer's building to the customer's property line shall be paid by the property owner. The affected property owner shall also pay for all costs germane to the construction, installation and maintenance of the extension of the sewer facility from the customer's property line to the then existing public sewer, the costs shall be added to the fees identified in Subsections (a) and (b) of this Section.

The Director of Finance or his or her designee may, at his sole discretion, prescribe an additional deposit for two-inch or larger meters based on unusual anticipated sewer use. 
(2)  As an alternative to any of the deposits required in Subsection (a)(1) of this Section, three times the estimated monthly bill shall be paid, whichever required amount is greater. 
(3)  In the alternative, as to the above-required deposits, an applicant for a 5/8 - × 3/4-inch meter may furnish a letter of credit reference from a previous utility company showing a history of nondelinquent payments for the latest 12-month period, and an applicant for a one-inch or larger meter may furnish a bank letter of credit in a form acceptable to the City Attorney. Customers subsequently delinquent in the payment of their sewer bill shall be reassessed the deposit required by subsections 86-70(a)(1), (2), and (4) plus all delinquent charges. 
(4)  After initiation of the sewer service, if the average monthly usage increases by more than 25 percent over prior usage, the Director of Finance or his or her designee may reassess the deposit required of the owner or occupant of a sewer unit in accordance with Subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this Section. 
(b)  Refunds. Deposits required by this Section shall constitute a guarantee to the City that all sums of money due by virtue of the furnishing of sewer service to the person making the deposit will be fully paid. Upon the payment of all such sums, the City shall, upon the disconnection of sewer service, refund and return to the person making such deposit the amount of the deposit or the net balance thereof after deducting those sums due the City. The customer shall be paid as required by state law. If the user maintains a good and timely payment record of the user's utility bills for a minimum period of two years, the Director of Finance shall refund the sewer deposit. Customers subsequently delinquent in the payment of their utility bill shall be reassessed the deposit required by Subsection (a) of this Section, plus all delinquent charges. 
(c)  Waiver. If a customer is presently being provided service by the City, and, after review of the previous 12 months' payment records, the customer has not been delinquent, the deposit to initiate utility service at a new address on the utility system will be waived. Customers subsequently delinquent in the payment of their sewer bill shall be reassessed the deposit required by subsections (a)(1), (2) and (4) of this Section, plus all delinquent charges. 
(d)  Special fund. All deposits made under the provisions of this Section shall be deposited in the City's Pooled Cash interest bearing account with the deposits being segregated in a separate general ledger account and interest earned being apportioned to the separate general ledger account based on average daily balance per month. 
(e)  Interest. Customer meter deposits shall accrue interest commencing on the first day following the month of initial deposit. No interest shall be paid if a customer closes or finalizes his account at any time within six months from the date of interest accrual. Total accrued interest shall be credited to the account of the customer when a customer closes or finalizes his account at any time after the expiration of six months from the date of interest accrual. All bills shall be finalized at the end of each month. Accrued interest shall be credited to the accounts of all eligible customers once each year during October, and shall not exceed the undistributed accrued interest actually paid by the City's depository.

_____
(d)  Extra charges based on the strength of the sewage and liquid wastes shall be made on the following basis: 
(1)  High strength BOD. The surcharge for high strength BOD in dollars shall be computed by multiplying the total milligrams per liter of BOD above 300 milligrams per liter times the metered water used during the billing period, in millions of gallons, times a treatment surcharge factor. The surcharge factor shall be derived annually from the following formula: 
BOD surcharge factor = Cost of treatment per million gallons / 300 
where cost of treatment per million gallons equals operational costs of the City's sewage treatment plant and the Iron Bridge treatment plant costs for the preceding fiscal year (including pro rata administrative costs) divided by the total sewage flow through all plants in millions of gallons, and 300 equals the maximum normal BOD content expressed in milligrams per liter. 
(2)  High strength TSS. The surcharge for high strength TSS in dollars shall be computed by multiplying the total milligrams per liter of TSS above 300 milligrams per liter times the metered water used during the billing period, in millions of gallons, times a treatment surcharge factor. The surcharge factor shall be derived annually from the following formula: 
TSS surcharge factor = Cost of treatment per million gallons / 300 
where cost of treatment per million gallons equals operational costs of the City's sewage treatment plant and the Iron Bridge treatment plant costs for the preceding fiscal year (including pro rata administrative costs) divided by the total sewage flow through all plants in millions of gallons, and 300 equals the maximum normal TSS content expressed in milligrams per liter.

The sewer bill is due and payable when rendered. If payment is not received by the City in full prior to the due date of the customer's next monthly bill, the unpaid amount is to be considered in arrears and delinquent. If there is an arrearage amount due when the next monthly bill is printed, a late fee will be assessed at the rate of 11/2 percent per month on the arrearage amount, or $5.00, whichever amount is greater. The words "second notice" will appear on the monthly bill along with the late fee charges. When this occurs, the arrearage, late fee and current charges must be paid in full by the due date noted on the "second notice" bill or all utility services will be discontinued the day after the due date. 
(b)  If a consumer receives both water and sewer service, nonpayment of either the water or sewer bill shall constitute a delinquency under this Section and authorize abatement of service by the City. 
(c)  The Director of Public Works shall impose a shutoff fee in the sum of $30.00 on all sewer service accounts which have been shut off pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this Section.

If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under Section 86-132. The notification requirement in this Section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of Sections 86-138 and 86-133. 
(b)  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a), above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(c)  In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the Director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and State hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(d)  In the case of any notification made under this Section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(e)  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this Article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable Federal or State law. 
(Ord. No. 1041, § I, 11-26-01)

Sec. 86-186. - System development charge, tapping fees, and meter installation charge. 
(a)  Generally. There are hereby established uniform charges for the initial construction and expansion of major main lines and water supply treatment plants and plant capacity, water storage, and master pumping facilities, fire flow and pressure capacities, and other necessary water production and transmission facilities inside and outside the corporate limits of the City which shall be paid for by the user prior to hookup or as specified by agreement, pursuant to Section 86-3, for the maximum present and future performance of the waterworks system as additional connection are completed. 
(1)  Water system development charge. A one-time charge of $2.40 per gallon of capacity shall be charged to customers within the City in accordance with the following schedule: 
Description ERU (gpd) Water System Development Charge [*] Residential: Single-family 250 $600.00/unit Multi-family 188 451.00/unit Commercial / Non-Residential: 5/8" x 3/4" Meter 250 $600.00/meter 1" Meter 625 1,500.00/meter 1 1/2" Meter 1,250 3,000.00/meter 2" Meter 2,000 4,800.00/meter 3" Meter 3,750 9,000.00/meter 4" Meter 6,250 15,000.00/meter 6" Meter 12,500 30,000.00/meter 8" Meter 20,000 48,000.00/meter 10" Meter 31,250 75,000.00/meter [*] Amounts based on an adopted fee of $2.40 per gallon of capacity calculated on an average daily flow basis effective January 1, 2018.  
Notes: 
1.  One ERU factor is equivalent to 250 gallons per day calculated on an average daily flow basis. 
2.  The fees shown above reflect the minimum system development charges to be applied per unit or per meter size; however, the City may elect to charge a system development charge equal to the greater of: 1) the minimum fee per unit or meter size; or 2) an alternative method based on the total equivalent residential unit (ERU) value determined by multiplying the number of fixture units, as published in the Southern Standard Plumbing Code, by 25, and then dividing that numerator by 250 (gallons per day per ERU), then multiplying by $600.00. 
Total ERU Value = Number of fixture units x 25 / 250 
For example, the Southern Standard Plumbing Code indicates that a kitchen sink has a fixture unit value of 2. To determine the total fee, take the 2, multiply by 25, then divide by 250, then multiply by $600.00: 
2 x 25 / 250 × $600 = $120.00 
3.  For industrial facilities or other facilities where the schedule or formula set out in this Subsection is not applicable, the equivalent ERUs and flows shall be evaluated on an individual basis to determine the water system development charges.

Sec. 86-190. - Review of rates and charges. 
    In order that the rates and charges for utility services may remain fair and equitable and be in proportion to the cost of providing services to the various users, the City shall cause a study to be made every three to five years from the effective date of the ordinance from which this Article is derived. Such study shall include but shall not be limited to an analysis of the costs associated with the volume, and delivery flow rate characteristics attributed to the various users or user classes, the financial position of the water and reclaimed water systems, and the adequacy of all revenues to provide reasonable funds for required retirement of debt and debt service, operation, and maintenance, replacements and capital improvements to the water and reclaimed water systems. The studies shall be conducted by a firm of certified public accountants or a firm of consulting engineers, which firms shall have experience in conducting such studies. 
(Code 1982, § 51.06; Ord. No. 719, § VI, 12-16-91; Ord. No. 763, § IV, 7-7-93; Ord. No. 1050, § 1, 6-24-02; Ord. No. 02-1056, § 5, 7-22-02; Ord. No. 05-1168, § 1, 7-25-05; Ord. No. 09-1277, § 1, 3-23-09) 
Sec. 86-191. - Billing; payment of charges; termination of service. 
(a)  Water bills shall be rendered monthly and shall be included with the sewer, garbage and utility tax bill, but each charge shall be shown as a separate item on the bill. The water bill is due and payable when rendered. If payment is not received by the City in full prior to the due date of the customer's next monthly bill, the unpaid amount is to be considered in arrears and delinquent. If there is an arrearage amount due when the next monthly bill is printed, a late fee will be assessed at the rate of 11/2 percent per month on the arrearage amount, or $5.00, whichever amount is greater. The words "Second Notice" will appear on the monthly bill along with the late fee charges. When this occurs, the arrearage, late fee and current charges must be paid in full by the due date noted on the "second notice" bill or all utility services will be discontinued the day after the due date. 
(b)  The Director of Finance shall impose a shutoff fee in the sum of $30.00 on all water or reclaimed water service accounts which have been shut off pursuant to Subsection (a) of this Section. Where service has been disconnected, service will not resume until the total amount due, which includes the arrearage, late fee, current charges, the sum of $30.00 representing a shutoff fee, and a reconnect fee of $40.00 has been paid to the City. 
(c)  The Director of Finance is authorized to impose a delinquency charge of $30.00 on all water service accounts delinquent for over 20 calendar days and is hereby authorized to discontinue utility service to such delinquent accounts after notice. 
(d)  Voluntary shutoff or termination and all deposits, refunds of deposits, charges and conditions germane thereto can be arranged in advance with the Director of Finance or his or her staff. 
(e)  The Director of Finance is authorized to impose a service charge of $25.00 for each trip to perform a field service requested by the customer other than (a) to initiate or relocate service (covered by other charges), (b) for a customer-requested re-read (covered pursuant to Section 86-226), and (c) to turn off/turn on for leak repair (courtesy of the city). The customer will only be charged a fee if the reason for the call is related to the equipment located on the customer's property, from the meter to the customer's home or building. The customer must be notified in advance of this potential charge. 
(Code 1982, § 51.07; Ord. No. 719, § VII, 12-16-91; Ord. No. 736, § II, 5-5-92; Ord. No. 03-1083, § 2, 6-9-03; Ord. No. 05-1168, § 1, 7-25-05; Ord. No. 09-1277, § 1, 3-23-09; Ord. No. 17-1469, § 3 (Att. B), 10-30-17) 
Sec. 86-192. - Adjustment of bills. 
(a)  No abatements or deductions on water consumption charges based on meter readings will be allowed and refunded except for errors on the part of the City. When charges are based on inaccuracy in meter registration, or in the event of error by the City in making a charge, abatement or deduction will be considered if the abatement or adjustment is presented in writing within 30 days after the date of rendition of the disputed bill. 
(b)  Under no circumstances will abatements, allowances, deductions or refunds be made on water supply service accounts because of water used, lost or wasted through, carelessness, neglect or otherwise after the water has passed through the customer's meter, except for cases of excessive leakage where documentation is presented in writing within 30 days of the date of the bill verifying the correction of the excessive leakage. Documentation shall be in the form of a completed Adjustment Request Form with plumber receipts providing the location of leak or statement by the owner regarding repairs completed by the owner with receipts for materials. Upon detection of excessive water usage, the City will notify the owner of the excessive amount of water used and the City will allow the owner/tenant 72 hours to correct the matter. If the excessive water usage is not corrected within 72 hours, service will be interrupted. The water bill shall be decreased such that the charge for the excess gallons will equal the actual cost of production of the water. Actual cost of production as used herein is defined as the energy cost for the withdrawal from the well and the cost of chemical treatment. Adjustments to the water bill as provided herein shall be approved by the Public Works Director. 
(Code 1982, § 51.08; Ord. No. 03-1076, § 1, 1-13-03) 
Sec. 86-193. - Delinquent accounts. 
    All water service accounts which are delinquent shall result in the discontinuance of water, sewer and garbage service to the customer after a "second notice" bill has been sent to the customer as provided in sections 86-82(a) and 86-191. Where service has been disconnected, service will not resume until the total amount of the delinquent account, the shutoff fee, late fee, and reconnect fee has been paid to the City.

    All contracts for water supply service shall expire at the end of the next succeeding calendar month from the date of written application. All contracts shall be automatically renewed without notice from either party, from month to month, unless five days' notice is given in writing and all charges are paid in full. Payment of charges at any interval or period other than monthly shall not be construed as altering the period of the contract or its renewal under this Section. 
(Code 1982, § 51.16) 
Sec. 86-208. - Change in ownership of premises. 
(a)  Notification of City. In the event of any change in ownership or occupancy of any premises connected to the City water system, theCity shall be immediately notified of the change. Notice shall include the name of the new owner or occupant, if known. In the absence of application for service by the new owner or occupant, the use of the City service may, at the option of the City, be taken and construed as acceptance by the new owner or occupant of all contract obligations of the preceding owner or occupant with the City, including payment for unpaid services. 
(b)  Responsibility for payment of charges. 
(1)  If any owner fails to notify the City in writing of the change in ownership or occupancy of any premises for water supply service, the owner shall continue to be liable to the City for all rates and charges accrued and accruing for the service until either the termination of the contract period, at which time he may notify the City of his desire to cancel, or until the City has, of its own volition, canceled the contract with the owner. 
(2)  This Section shall not preclude the City from also demanding from the new owner or occupant the payment for all or any charges which shall, at the time of the demand, be unpaid or unsecured, without regard to whether the charges accrued prior or subsequent to the change in ownership or occupancy. Upon failure of the new owner to comply with this demand within 72 hours after written notice thereof, the City shall have the right to shut off the water supply and discontinue the service. 
(3)  In no case of change of ownership shall the preceding owner be released from any contractual obligations with the City until the expiration of the contract, except at the option of the City. 
(Code 1982, § 51.17) 
Sec. 86-209. - Commencement of service. 
(a)  When application for water supply service is made, the service, together with the charges and rates therefor, shall begin on the date of the completion of the service connection by the City, unless the owner states in writing in the application that the service connection shall be shut off immediately upon its installation. In that event, the connection shall then be shut off and shall thereafter be turned on by the City only upon written request of the owner; further, the charges and rates for water supply service shall commence on the date of turn-on in accordance with this Article as though the turn-on request had been an original application. 
(b)  Where there has been a change in ownership prior to a turn-on of the service connection, the new owner shall sign the application for water supply upon the regular form before actual turn-on, and make the necessary deposits, unless the previous owner has requested in writing that the service, including deposit, be transferred to the new owner. 
(Code 1982, § 51.18) 
Sec. 86-210. - Cancellation. 
    All contracts for City water service shall be subject to cancellation of service and discontinued by the City for any of the following reasons: 
(1)  If there has been any misrepresentation or concealment in the application as to the premises or fixtures to be furnished by the City water supply service or the use to be made of the service. 
(2)  If there has been any waste or excessive use of water through improper or defective pipes and fixtures or appliances, or in any other manner. 
(3)  If the customer has refused or neglected to make any advance payment, if such payment is required by the City, or refused or neglected to comply with any requirement of the City as to meter or service connection maintenance, alteration or renewal.

For the purpose of this Section, an interference or tampering with any appliance used in connection with or for controlling or regulating the water supply service to any premises shall be construed and taken to be the act of the owners or consumers using the water service at the premises. 
(6)  If written notification is provided to the Customer Service Division indicating that the consumer will not temporarily need the water supply system, and desires the service to be reconnected at a future date. 
(7)  If there has been a violation of any ordinance of the City related to use of the water supply service. 
(8)  If there has been a change in ownership or occupancy of the premises, but no application from the new owners or occupants has been made and approved by the City.

ARTICLE VII. - FERTILIZER MANAGEMENT 

Sec. 86-342. - Findings. 
    As a result of impairment to surface waters caused by excessive nutrients, and as a result of increasing levels of nitrogen in the surface and ground water within the aquifers and springs, the City Commission of the City of Casselberry hereby determines that the use of Fertilizers creates a risk to contributing to adverse effects on surface and ground water. Accordingly, the City Commission hereby finds that management measures contained in the most recent edition of the Florida-Friendly Best Management Practices for Protection of Water Resources by the Green Industries are required. 
(Ord. No. 17-1472, § II, 11-20-17) 
Sec. 86-343. - Purpose and intent. 
    This Article: (a) regulates the proper use of Fertilizers by any Applicator; (b) requires proper training of commercial and Institutional Fertilizer Applicators; (c) establishes training and licensing requirements; (d) establishes a Prohibited Application Period; and (e) specifies allowable Fertilizer Application rates and methods, Fertilizer free zones, Low Maintenance Zones, and exemptions. This Article requires the use of Best Management Practices, which provide specific management guidelines to minimize negative secondary and cumulative environmental effects associated with the misuse of Fertilizers. These secondary and cumulative effects have been observed in and on natural and constructed stormwater conveyances, rivers, creeks, canals, springs, lakes, and other water bodies. Collectively, these water bodies are an asset critical to the environmental, recreational, cultural, and economic well-being of City residents and the health of the public in general. Overgrowth of algae and vegetation hinder the effectiveness of flood attenuation provided by natural and constructed stormwater conveyances. Regulation of nutrients, including both nitrogen and phosphorus contained in Fertilizer, will help improve and maintain water and habitat quality. 
(Ord. No. 17-1472, § II, 11-20-17) 
Sec. 86-344. - Definitions.

Chapter I - GENERAL ADMINISTRATION 
ARTICLE I. - PREAMBLE 

Section 1-1.1. - Title. 
    Notice.0. This ordinance shall be entitled the "City of Casselberry Unified Land Development Regulations." When hereinafter used, unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms "ordinance," "Code" or "land development regulations" refer to the City of Casselberry Unified Land Development Regulations. 
Section 1-1.2. - Legislative authority and binding effect. 
    The legislative authority for the City of Casselberry Unified Land Development Regulations is as follows: 
1.  F.S. § 163.3202 mandates that local governments shall adopt or amend and enforce land development regulations that are consistent with and implement their adopted comprehensive plan. 
2.  F.S. § 163.3202 requires that land development regulations shall contain specific and detailed provisions necessary or desirable to implement the adopted comprehensive plan and shall as a minimum: 
a.  Regulate the subdivision of land. 
b.  Regulate the use of land and water for those land use categories included in the land use element and ensure the compatibility of adjacent uses and provide for open space. 
c.  Provide for protection of potable water wellfields. 
d.  Regulate areas subject to seasonal and periodic flooding and provide for drainage and stormwater management. 
e.  Promote the protection of environmentally sensitive lands designated in the comprehensive plan. 
f.  Regulate signage. 
g.  Provide for concurrency management. The concurrency management system must require that no development order or permit for development be issued unless such order or permit is conditioned on the availability of required public facilities and services concurrent with the impacts of the development. The concurrency management system is further elaborated in Article IX of the City of Casselberry Comprehensive Plan. 
h.  Promote safe and convenient onsite traffic flow considering needed vehicle parking. 
Section 1-1.3. - Legislative purpose, intent and scope. 
    The purpose of the City of Casselberry Unified Land Development Regulations is to assist implementation of the City's Comprehensive Plan. More specifically the land development regulations are intended to carry out Comprehensive Plan policies concerned with land use; transportation; housing; public facilities, including potable water, sanitary sewers and drainage system, as well as groundwater recharge; parks; conservation; recreation and open space; intergovernmental coordination; and capital improvements and fiscal management. 
Section 1-1.4. - Consistency with Comprehensive Plan. 
    The City of Casselberry Unified Land Development Regulations, pursuant to F.S. §§ 163.3201 and 163.3202, is adopted to assist in carrying out the desired general policies of the Comprehensive Plan for managing the use of land and water within the City of Casselberry. The land development regulations shall remain consistent with the Comprehensive Plan as mandated by F.S. ch. 163, pt. II, County and Municipal Planning and Land Development Regulation. The land development regulations shall be amended as necessary to ensure consistency with the City of Casselberry Comprehensive Plan. 
Section 1-1.5. - Applicability. 
A.  General applicability. The land development regulations shall apply to all development or changes in land use throughout the City of Casselberry. No development, as defined herein, or change in land use shall be undertaken without prior authorization pursuant to this Code. 
B.  Status of previously issued construction permits. The provisions of this Code and any amendments thereto shall not affect the validity of any lawfully issued and effective construction permit if: 
1.  The development activity authorized by the permit has been commenced prior to the effective date of this Code or will be commenced after the effective date of this Code but within 60 days following the issuance of a valid building permit granted prior to the effective date of this Code; and 
2.  The development activity continues without interruption (except because of war or natural disaster) until the development is complete. If the construction permit expires, any further development on that site shall occur only in conformance with the requirements of this Code or as hereinafter may be amended. 
C.  Status of previously approved development plans. Projects with unexpired development plans on which development activity is taking place at the time this Code or an amendment thereto is adopted must meet only the requirements of the regulations in effect when the development plan was approved, unless otherwise provided in the development plan. However, such site plans shall terminate 12 months from the effective date of this ordinance if construction has not been started as evidenced by steady and continuous progress, including the pouring of footings by said termination date. If the development plan expires, any further development on that site shall occur only in conformance with the requirements of this Code or as this Code hereafter may be amended. 
    If the cause of the developer's failure to proceed is beyond the developer's control, the Administrative Official may review the conditions and determine if an extension is appropriate. The Administrative Official may grant no more than two site plan extensions. No single site plan extension shall exceed six months. Prior to granting a site plan extension, the Administrative Official shall render a finding that a valid concurrency facilities reservation is in effect for the duration of the extension period. 
Section 1-1.6. - Interpretation and conflict. 
A.  General interpretations. In the interpretation and application of this Code all provisions shall be: (1) considered as minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, morals and general welfare; (2) liberally construed in favor of the City, and; (3) deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
B.  Conflicts. More specific provisions of this Code shall be followed in lieu of more general provisions that may be more lenient than or in conflict with the more specific provision. 
    Where the provisions of the Code appear to conflict with another law, the most restrictive provision shall govern. 
Section 1-1.7. - Severability. 
    If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this Code is for any reason held by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, the validity of the remaining portions of this Code shall continue in full force and effect. 
Section 1-1.8. - Repeal.

    Any prosecution arising from a violation of any ordinance repealed by this ordinance, which prosecution may be pending at the time this Code becomes effective, or any prosecution which may be started within one year after the effective date of this Code as a consequence of any violation of any ordinance repealed therein, which violation was committed prior to the effective date of this Code, shall be tried and determined exactly as if such ordinance had not been repealed.

    The City Manager shall appoint an Administrative Official charged with authority to administer this ordinance and to enforce the regulations contained herein. The Administrative Official, in the performance of enforcement duties and functions, may enter upon any land and make examinations and surveys that do not occasion damage or injury to private property. For the purpose of administering and enforcing this ordinance, the Administrative Official may appoint appropriate persons who shall have the authority of the Administrative Official which are necessary to enforce the land development regulations. Designated personnel from the Community Development Department, Fire Department, Police Department and Public Works Department shall be vested with authority to implement and enforce provisions of the land development regulations. 
A.  Application, purpose and conflict. The Administrative Official shall apply the provisions of these regulations as minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, or the general welfare of the public. These regulations are not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any lawful easements, covenants or other agreements between parties; provided, however, that, where these regulations impose a greater restriction, the provisions of these regulations shall prevail. 
B.  Violation and enforcement procedures. If the Administrative Official shall find that any of the provisions of the land development regulations are being violated, written notification shall be directed to the person responsible for such violation, indicating the nature of the violation and ordering the action necessary to correct it. The Administrative Official shall order discontinuance of illegal use of land, buildings, or structures or of additions, alterations, or structural changes thereto; discontinuance of any illegal work to be done; or shall take any other action authorized by the land development regulations to ensure compliance with or to prevent violations of its provisions. 
The Administrative Official may order the protection of land, water, and other natural resources or the use of buildings; the discontinuance of the use of land or buildings; removal of trees to conform with height limitations set forth herein; removal of buildings, additions, and alterations of structures; discontinuance of any work being done; and may take any or all other action necessary to correct violations and obtain compliance with all the provisions of the land development regulations. 
1.  Violations reported by the public. Any person may report a violation of the land development regulations to the Administrative Official. Such reports shall be signed by the person submitting the written complaint. The written statement shall fully describe the basis for the complaint. The statement shall be filed and maintained by the Administrative Official who shall properly record the complaint, investigate the complaint, and take action necessary to remedy valid complaints as provided for in this Article. 
A verbal report of an alleged violation may be directed to the Administrative Official. A verbal report of violation received by the Administrative Official shall be processed by informing the complainant as to the written procedures described above. When a person does not subsequently submit a written report concerning violations, the Administrative Official shall ensure that a field inspection is carried out to verify the oral report concerning the alleged violation. 
Complaint investigations may also be based upon field inspections performed by the Administrative Official or other designated personnel. 
2.  Investigation. In conducting investigations of violations, the Administrative Official and City inspectors shall have the authority, where lawful, to inspect property, obtain the signed statements of prospective witnesses, photograph violations, and do such other gathering of evidence as is necessary for the complete investigation of a violation of the land development regulations. 
Where it is determined that a probable violation of the land development regulations exists, the owner or tenant of any building, structure, premises or part thereof and any architect, builder, contractor, agent or other person who commits, participates in, assists in or maintains such violation may each be found guilty of a separate offense and suffer the penalties provided for in Section 1-1.11 herein. 
3.  Notice of violation. Prior to issuing a citation for a violation of this Code, the Administrative Official shall provide written notice to the violator that the violator has committed a violation of a Code and shall establish a reasonable time period within which the violator must correct the violation. If, upon investigation, the Administrative Official finds that the violator has not corrected the violation within the time period, the violator may be issued a citation. If, however, the Administrative Official finds a repeat violation or if the Administrative Official has reason to believe that the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety, morals or welfare, or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible, the Administrative Official does not have to provide the violator with a reasonable time period to correct the violation prior to issuing a citation and may immediately issue a citation. 
4.  Issuance of citation. A citation issued by the Administrative Official or other designated City official shall state the date and time of issuance; name and address of the person in violation; date of the violation; section of the land development regulations, or subsequent amendments thereto, violated; name of the City Administrative Official, date and time when the violator shall appear in Seminole County court. 
5.  Cease and desist orders. The Administrative Official shall have the authority to issue cease and desist orders in the form of written official notices given to the owner of the subject building, property, or premises, or to his agent, lessee, tenant, contractor, or to any person using the land, building, or premises where a misdemeanor violation has been committed or shall exist. 
C.  Penalties and other legal remedies. The Administrative Official shall pursue each misdemeanor and any lawful civil action or proceeding as deemed necessary in compliance with this Code. The City Commission may establish a schedule of fines for penalizing violators. Each day the offense continues after due notice shall be deemed a separate offense and the schedule of fines shall be applied accordingly. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
Violation of the provisions of this Article or failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with an approved conditional use, site plan approval, dimensional variance or modification, or other approval action) by any person shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Code Enforcement Board or Special Magistrate and any other remedies available to the City. 
When any person takes action which is known, or reasonably should have been known, to depart from approved plans for development which has been granted, a penalty of ten percent of the fair market value of the work done and materials used in the subject violation of the approved plans, or $250.00, whichever is greater, shall be charged. Fair market value shall be determined by reference to any plans, specifications, and other materials submitted to the City in conjunction with an application for a building permit or based on an appraisal by a qualified property appraiser designated by the Administrative Official. The cost of such appraisal shall be borne by the petitioner. 
Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy a violation of the land development regulations. 
D.  Administrative appeals. Appeals of an administrative official's decision are determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission and may be initiated by any person aggrieved or by any officer, board or agency of the City in the enforcement of this ordinance.

I.  Reviews required by the Planning and Zoning Commission. Pursuant to the state's Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act, the following reviews by the Planning and Zoning Commission are mandated: 
1.  Review of development for consistency with Comprehensive Plan. 
a.  Intent. In compliance with F.S. § 163.3194, all development within the City of Casselberry and all development orders and public actions related to such development shall be consistent with the City's adopted Comprehensive Plan as may be hereafter amended. "Development order" as stated herein shall mean any order granting, denying, or granting with conditions an application for a development permit, building permit, zoning permit, subdivision approval, rezoning, variance, or any other action having the effect of permitting the development of land as defined in F.S. § 163.3161. 
b.  Review by the Planning and Zoning Commission. Where an administrative board or other administrative official as may be charged by the City Commission determines that a question exists as to a development application's consistency with the Comprehensive Plan, a written report and recommendation regarding such question shall be forwarded by the Administrative Official to the Planning and Zoning Commission for its review. The issue shall be placed before the Planning and Zoning Commission at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The applicant shall be notified of the meeting date, time, and place of the meeting. 
2.  Review and amendment of Comprehensive Plan. At least once every five years, the Comprehensive Plan shall be reviewed by the Planning and Zoning Commission to determine whether additions or amendments to the Comprehensive Plan are desirable based on demographic and economic trends; changes in land use, infrastructure or natural resources; fiscal considerations; or other factors. If the Planning and Zoning Commission desires an amendment or addition to the Comprehensive Plan, it may, on its own motion, direct the Administrative Official to prepare such amendment; and, if such amendment is in accordance with the purposes of the Comprehensive Plan, the Planning and Zoning Commission and the City Commission shall provide due public notice and convene hearings pursuant to procedures established in F.S. §§ 163.3184 and 163.3187. The City Commission shall consider recommendations of the Planning and Zoning Commission prior to final action on the proposed amendment. The procedure for revising, adding to, or amending the Comprehensive Plan shall be the same as the procedure for its original adoption. 
3.  Review of land development regulations adoption or amendment. Prior to adoption or amendment of the land development regulations, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall review such regulations and maps, and hold appropriate hearings as required pursuant to F.S. § 166.041.

(Ord. No. 05-1161, § 3, 6-27-05; Ord. No. 12-1369, § 5, 2-13-12) 
Section 1-2.7. - Variances to the Planning and Zoning Commission. 
    An owner or his authorized agent may request a variance from the land development regulations as provided for herein. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall have the quasi-judicial power necessary to grant such variances that will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the land development regulations would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance from the terms of the land development regulations shall not be granted by the Planning and Zoning Commission unless and until the following requirements are met: 
A.  Application. All applications for variances shall be in the form required and provided by the Administrative Official. Such application shall be submitted to the Administrative Official together with the fee established by resolution of the City Commission. A "completed application" shall include the application form, the fee and all required supplemental information necessary to render determinations related to the variance request. 
Upon receipt of an application for a variance, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall hold a public hearing upon the application in accordance with the procedures cited below in Subsection B, and render an order granting or denying such application. In granting such application the Planning and Zoning Commission must make specific affirmative findings respecting each of the matters specified in Subsection C., below, and may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards, including requirements in excess of those otherwise required by these land development regulations, which shall become a part of the terms under which a development order may be issued. 
B.  Notice and hearing procedure for variances. In considering and acting upon applications for variance, the following procedures shall be observed: 
1.  Date of hearing. The hearing shall be held by the Planning and Zoning Commission at a date and time fixed by the chairperson of the Planning and Zoning Commission. 
2.  Notice. Upon notification by the chairperson of the Planning and Zoning Commission of the date fixed for hearing on any matter subject to the provisions of this Section, the Administrative Official shall cause a notice of the time, place and purpose of such hearing to be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of Casselberry at least 15 days prior to the date of the hearing. 
a.  Mailing of notice. The Administrative Official shall also mail similar notices at least ten days prior to the scheduled hearing setting forth the time, place and purpose of the hearing to (a) the applicant; (b) the owner of the property described in the application, if other than the applicant; and (c) to all owners of real property within 300 feet of the boundaries of the land upon which the variance is requested, except that, where the property for which the request has been made is located in a commercial or industrial zoning district, notice shall be mailed to all owners of real property within 500 feet of the boundaries of the property. 
For the purpose of notice requirements to nearby owners of real property, the names and addresses of the owners shall be deemed to be those on the current tax records of the county and will be provided to the City by the applicant. 
The failure of any owner required by this Section to be notified by mail to receive such notice shall not invalidate or otherwise have any effect on the action of the Planning and Zoning Commission on any application. 
b.  Applicant to pay costs. All costs of notification shall be paid by the applicant. 
3.  Appearance and presentation. At any hearing upon any matter subject to the provisions of this Section, the applicant seeking action by the Planning and Zoning Commission and any other party desiring to be heard upon the application may appear in person, by agent or by attorney. The applicant shall be entitled to make an initial presentation respecting the application and, at the conclusion of presentations or statements by all other parties, shall be entitled to offer a statement in rebuttal to such presentations if the applicant so desires. The chairperson of the Planning and Zoning Commission may, at the commencement of the hearing upon each application or at any time during such hearing, require that parties desiring to make a presentation identify themselves and may specify the time to be allowed each such party within which to make such presentation. 
C.  Standards for considering variances. Before any variance may be granted, the Planning and Zoning Commission must find all of the following: 
1.  Existence of special conditions or circumstances. That special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure or building involved and which are not applicable to other land, structures or buildings in the same zoning district. 
2.  Conditions not created by applicant. That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from the action or negligence of the applicant. 
3.  Special privileges not conferred. That granting the variance requested will not confer upon the applicant any special privileges denied by the land development regulations to other lands, buildings or structures in the same zoning district. 
4.  Hardship conditions exist. That literal interpretation of the provisions of the land development regulations would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in this same zoning district under the terms of this ordinance and would work unnecessary and undue hardship on the applicant. 
5.  Only minimum variance granted. That the variance granted is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, building or structure. 
6.  Not injurious to the public welfare. That the grant of the variance will be in harmony with the general intent and purpose of the land development regulations and that such variance will not be injurious to the area involved or otherwise detrimental to the public interest or welfare. 
D.  Action. Action by the Planning and Zoning Commission upon any matter subject to the provisions of this Section shall be announced by the chairperson of the Planning and Zoning Commission immediately following the vote determining such action and shall thereafter be embodied in a written order prepared by the Administrative Official and executed by the chairperson of the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Administrative Official. Such written order shall be incorporated into the minutes of the meeting at which such action occurred. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall enter its order denying such application, specifying the reasons therefor, or granting such application, in whole or in part, under such terms and conditions as the Commission shall determine appropriate. 
Under no circumstances shall the Planning and Zoning Commission grant a variance to permit a use not generally permitted by right or as a conditional use in the zoning district involved or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of the ordinance in the zoning district. No nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or buildings in the same zoning district and no permitted use of lands, structures, or buildings in other zoning districts shall be considered grounds for the authorization of a variance. No variance shall be granted that increases the density or intensity of a use in a manner inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan. 
The Planning and Zoning Commission shall make factual findings regarding the following: 
1.  Whether or not the requirements of the land development regulations have been met by the applicant for a variance. 
2.  Whether or not the reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance and whether or not the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of land, building, or structure. 
3.  Whether or not the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the land development regulations and whether or not the variance will be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. 
An order permitting a variance may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards, including visual screening, and may also prescribe a reasonable time limit within which construction or occupancy of the premises for the proposed use shall have begun or have been completed or both. Upon entry of an order granting a variance, the Administrative Official shall not issue any development order for the subject property unless and until all of the conditions and requirements of the order granting the variance are met. Violation of those conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of the land development regulations. 
E.  Effect and limitation of variance. An order granting a variance shall be deemed applicable to the parcel for which it is granted and not to the individual applicant, provided that no order granting a variance shall be deemed valid with respect to any use of the premises other than the use specified in the application for a variance. 
F.  Appeals of the decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission.

However, as a condition to granting the applicant's request, the Commission may establish any fees necessary to cover all expenses resulting from the continuance, delay, or postponement. The Commission shall reschedule the hearing as soon as practicable, but in any event within the following 180 days. Further request for continuance, delay, or postponement shall result in denial of the application, and the application shall be subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Subsection 1-2.9(D)(2).

2.  Upon Planning and Zoning Commission denial. If the Planning and Zoning Commission denies the requested change or amendment to the land development regulations, this action shall be deemed final unless such action is appealed to the City Commission within ten calendar days following the oral decision announced by the Planning and Zoning Commission at its final hearing on the issue. The applicant shall file such notice of appeal with the City Clerk. 
If an appeal to a decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission is filed, the City Clerk shall transmit copies of the petition, the comments and the minutes of the Planning and Zoning Commission meeting to each member of the City Commission at least seven days before the Commission shall consider the appeal.

However, where the Planning and Zoning Commission's recommendation is adverse to the proposed amendment, the change shall not become effective except by an affirmative vote of a majority of the City Commission. 
Whenever the City Commission has taken final action regarding changing the zoning classification of property, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall not reconsider any petition for the rezoning of any part or all of the same property for a period of 180 days from the date of the final consideration by the City Commission. However, this time limit may be waived by the affirmative vote of four members of the City Commission when such action is deemed necessary to prevent injustice or to facilitate the proper development of the City. 
E.  Public hearings on land development regulations amendments. Due public notice shall be provided pursuant to F.S. § 166.041. 
ARTICLE III. - DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS 

Section 1-3.1. - Authorization to enter into agreements. 
    The City Commission of the City of Casselberry, in its sole and exclusive discretion, may enter into development agreements with the legal and equitable owners of real property within, or to be annexed to the City limits of, the City of Casselberry, as is authorized in F.S. § 163.3220, and as is further set forth under the terms of this Article. 
    The Florida legislature has found that: 
1.  The lack of certainty in the approval of development can result in a waste of economic and land resources, discourage sound capital improvement planning and financing, escalate the cost of housing and development, and discourage commitment to Comprehensive Planning. 
2.  Assurance to a developer that upon receipt of a development permit the applicant may proceed in accordance with existing laws and policies, subject to the conditions of a development agreement, strengthens the public planning process, encourages sound capital improvement planning and financing, assists in assuring there are adequate capital facilities for the development, encourages private participation in comprehensive planning and reduces the economic costs of development. 
3.  The comprehensive planning process should be furthered by authorizing local governments to enter into development agreements with developers. The intent is to encourage a stronger commitment to comprehensive and capital facilities planning, ensure the provision of adequate public facilities for development, encourage the efficient use of resources, and reduce the economic cost of development. 
Section 1-3.2. - Applicability. 
    The City of Casselberry may, by ordinance, establish procedures and requirements, as provided in F.S. §§ 163.3220-163.3243, to consider and enter into a development agreement with any person having a legal or equitable interest in real property located within its jurisdiction. 
    The entry into a development agreement by the City of Casselberry shall in no way whatsoever limit or modify any legislative power of the City to adopt ordinances, resolutions or regulations or to make executive or legislative decisions of any kind which it had the power to make prior to the entry into such development agreement, except to the degree that the development agreement, by its express terms and not by implication, gives vested rights to said property owner as to certain development permissions, required improvements and similar matters. No development agreement shall, by its express terms or by implication, limit the right of the City Commission to adopt ordinances or regulations or to adopt policies that are of general application in the City, except as is expressly provided by F.S. §§ 163.3220-163.3243. 
Section 1-3.3. - Applicant initiates process.

Such written request shall identify the lands which are desired to be subject to the development agreement and shall identify all legal and equitable owners having any interest in such property. Such ownership interest shall be certified by a title company or an attorney at law licensed to practice law in the State of Florida. In the event that any partnerships, joint ventures or other entities, other than individuals, own a legal or equitable interest in the subject property, all principals and other persons with interest in such partnerships or joint ventures shall be revealed. In the event that any corporation owns a legal or equitable interest in the subject property, the officers and directors and any shareholder owning more than ten percent of the interest in the corporation shall be revealed.

    Upon receipt of a request to enter a development agreement with the City, the City Administrative Official shall place the matter on the agenda of the City Commission, and the City Commission, after considering staff comments, shall, in its sole and absolute discretion, determine whether or not it desires to pursue negotiations with the property owner relative to the entry into a development agreement. In the event that the City Commission determines not to proceed with further negotiations or discussions regarding the development agreement, a prorated portion of the fee paid by the applicant shall be refunded. In the event that the City Commission instructs the City Administrative Official with appropriate City staff to proceed with further negotiations, the fee shall thereafter be nonrefundable, regardless of whether or not a development agreement is ultimately consummated.

11.  A preliminary master drainage plan for the development consistent with Article X, indicating thereon the existing drainage features and land topography, along with and superimposed thereon the proposed drainage features indicating clearly the means by which the finally developed land will collect, regulate and conduct the drainage runoff from the lands developed and tributary thereto.

B.  Initial staff negotiations. The City Administrative Official and the Development Review Committee shall review the development proposal of the applicant and shall meet and negotiate with the developer or his agents regarding the appropriate development of the lands and shall negotiate the terms and conditions on which said lands should be developed. Said terms and conditions shall be compiled in a written report by the Development Review Committee. The report shall be based on matters deemed appropriate and necessary for the protection of the public interest, and shall be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan and the requirements of the land development regulations. 
C.  Development Review Committee report to City Manager. At such time as the applicant and the Development Review Committee have reached tentative agreement as to the terms and conditions of the development agreement, the City Administrative Official shall report the status of such negotiations to the City Manager. Such tentative agreement shall not give rise to any development rights or equitably or legally vest any development rights in the applicant. 
    In the alternative, if the City Administrative Official deems that no further negotiations would be useful because of the unlikely possibility of reaching a consensus on the terms and conditions of the development agreement, the City Administrative Official shall likewise report the status of such negotiations to the City Commission. 
    In the event that the Development Review Committee and the developer have negotiated terms of a mutually acceptable development agreement, the essential terms of that development agreement shall be presented by the City Administrative Official in outline form to the City Commission. The City Commission shall review the outline of the development agreement and determine whether to proceed. 
D.  City Commission review. If the City Commission, by a simple majority vote, determines to proceed with completion of the development agreement, it shall direct the City Attorney to reduce the terms of the development agreement to contractual form for further consideration by the City Commission. This direction shall, in no manner whatsoever, obligate the City Commission to ultimately approve a development agreement or to approve any of the matters or any specific term or condition negotiated by the City staff or other City Commission appointee. 
    In the event that the Development Review Committee has not negotiated a mutually satisfactory development agreement, the City Administrative Official shall so notify the City Commission, and the City Commission shall formally conclude the process of negotiating the development agreement. No further consideration of such application shall come before the City Commission. A further development agreement application may be submitted no sooner than 180 calendar days from the date of the City Administrative Official's notification to the City Commission that the previous development agreement application was terminated.

6.  The applicant may be required to provide for a performance bond, letter of credit, or similar instrument, to be deposited with the City to secure the construction of any new facilities that are required to be constructed as part of the proposed development agreement. Alternatively, such construction may be a condition precedent to the issuance of any building permits or other development permissions. In the event that the new public facilities are in place and operating at the time development permits are requested, no such performance bond or letter of credit shall be necessary unless such facilities are not adequate for the project. 
7.  A description of any reservation or dedication of land for public purposes. The development agreement shall provide specifically how all impact fees and other funding requirements for the project are to be met. 
8.

c.  In the event that development requirements are not satisfied, action in reliance on the development agreement or expenditures in pursuance of its terms shall not vest any development rights to the applicant/property owner. Failure to perform as specified in the development agreement shall not constitute partial performance and not entitle the applicant or property owner to a continuation of the development agreement. 
10.  A specific finding in the development agreement that the development permitted or proposed is consistent with the City's Comprehensive Plan and with the land development regulations. However, if amendments are required to the Comprehensive Plan or land development regulations, such amendments shall be specifically identified in the development agreement, and the agreement shall be contingent upon those amendments being made and approved by the appropriate governmental agencies. 
11.  The City Commission may provide for any conditions, terms, restrictions or other requirements determined to be reasonably necessary for the public health, safety or welfare of City residents and property owners. 
12.  A statement indicating that failure of the development agreement to address a particular permit, condition, term or restriction shall not relieve the developer of the necessity of complying with the law governing said permitting requirements, conditions, terms or restrictions.

Section 1-3.12. - Effect of subsequently adopted laws and ordinances. 
A.  Local laws and ordinances. The City may apply subsequently adopted laws and policies to a development that is subject to a development agreement only if the City Commission has held a public hearing and determined that such new or amended laws and policies are (ref. F.S. § 163.3233): 
1.  Not in conflict with laws and policies governing the development agreement and do not prevent development of land uses, intensities or densities allowed under the terms of the development agreement.

F.S. § 163.3241). For each annual review conducted during years six through ten of a development agreement, the review shall be incorporated into a written report which shall be submitted to the parties to the agreement and the state land planning agency. 
Section 1-3.13. - Periodic review of development agreements. 
    Pursuant to F.S. § 163.3235, the City shall review land subject to a development agreement at least once every 12 months.

The City Administrative Official shall present the City Commission with a report on the status of all activities and achievements pursuant to the development agreement. 
    Prior to the City's review of the status of a development agreement, the developer or property owner shall, within 14 days of the City Commission's review of the development agreement, submit to the City a progress report indicating all activities and achievements since the execution of the development agreement and, if applicable, since the previous periodic report. 
    In the event that the City no longer has a record of the present property owner and/or developer, any requests or notices required by this ordinance shall be made to the property owner of record as shown on the records of the Seminole County Property Appraiser. 
Section 1-3.14. - Modification or revocation. 
    Pursuant to F.S. § 163.3235, in the event that the City Commission finds, on the basis of substantial competent evidence, that there has been a failure to comply with the terms of the development agreement, the agreement may be revoked or modified by the City Commission.

Section 1-4.5. - Same; revisions. 
    The following are authorized revisions to existing text in the Florida Building Code by the City of Casselberry: 
BC SECTION 1606 
WIND LOADS 
FBC Section 1606.1.6 Basic wind speed. The basic wind speed in miles per hour, for the development of wind loads, shall be determined from Figure 1606. Basic wind speed for the special wind regions indicated, near mountainous terrain and near gorges shall be in accordance with local jurisdiction requirements. The exact location of wind speed lines shall be established by local ordinance using recognized physical landmarks such as major roads, canals, rivers and lakeshores, wherever possible. For the purpose of complying with the structural requirements related to wind loads, all buildings and structures shall be designed for a minimum wind load of 110 mph in accordance with Figure 1606. With regard to compliance with criteria relating to protection from wind borne debris, the City of Casselberry is deemed to be located landward of the 110 mph wind contour line in Figure 1606 and therefore, buildings within this city are not required to have openings protected from wind borne debris except for critical facilities which voluntarily provide protection of openings from wind borne debris. 
(Ord. No. 03-1092, § 4, 8-11-03) 
Section 1-4.6. - Amendments to the standard unsafe building abatement code.

2. Any means of egress or portion thereof, such as but not limited to fire doors, closing devices and fire resistive ratings, is in disrepair or in a dilapidated or nonworking condition such that the means of egress could be rendered unsafe in case of fire or panic. 
3. The stress in any material, member or portion thereof due to all imposed loads including dead load, exceeds the stresses allowed in the Florida Building Code for new buildings.

Section 1-4.7. - Cessation of work/expiration of building permit. 
A.  The following criteria are provided to supplement the provisions of the Florida Building Code which permit the Building Official to require that any work which has not been commenced or completed be removed from the building site in the event that a new building permit is not obtained within 180 days after the date when the building permit became null and void. This process shall be supplemental to any other remedy provided by law. 
B.  Condemnation and Demolition Process. 
1.  Right of entry for inspection.

If entry is refused, or if the owner or other persons having charge of an unoccupied building or structure cannot be located, the Building Official, with the concurrence of the City Manager and Community Development Director, shall have recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure entry, including an inspection warrant. 
c.  When the Building Official or authorized designee shall have obtained permission to enter, secured an inspection warrant, or obtained another remedy provided by law to secure entry, no person shall fail, after proper credentials are displayed, to promptly permit entry into the building, structure or premises by the Building Official or authorized designee for the purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to this Code. Any person violating this division may be prosecuted within the limits of the law. 
2.  Inspections. The Building Official or an authorized designee shall inspect any building, structure, property or portion thereof which may violate Section 1-4.7 due to cessation of work or an expired building permit. After the Building Official or an authorized designee has determined that such structure, property or portion thereof violates Section 1-4.7, the Building Official or an authorized designee shall notify the City Manager, through the Community Development Director, of the Building Official's or an authorized designee's intent to issue a Notice of Violation as provided within this Section. 
3.  Notice of Violation. Whenever the Building Official or an authorized designee has determined that such structure, property or portion thereof is a violation of Section 1-4.7, the Building Official or an authorized designee shall prepare a written Notice of Violation and Notice of Pending Administrative Action to the owner of record, and all interested parties as identified by a search of the public records, in and for the county. 
a.  Requirements. The Notice of Violation and the Notice of Pending Administrative Action shall contain the following information, including, but not limited to: 
1)  The street address and legal description (if available) of the building, structure, or property. 
2)  A statement indicating construction on the building or structure has ceased and the building permit has expired for more than 180 days in violation of Section 1-4.7, and a summary of the facts which led to that determination. 
3)  If the building or structure is occupied, a statement indicating the time period in which occupants must vacate the building or structure, if applicable. 
4)  A statement of the remedial action to be taken, including but not limited to; obtaining a new building permit to complete construction, a date certain for completion of construction with a final approved inspection, or demolition of the building or structure, with or without further notice. 
5)  A statement that, after such removal or demolition by or on behalf of the Building Official, the City may approve and record a lien against the owner to recover costs pursuant to the City Code. 
6)  Inform the person served with the notice, and any other person having a legal interest in the property that, if the property owner or other interested party wishes to contest in whole or in part the material allegations in the notice, if the property owner or interested party desires to assert that the time period as set forth in the notice poses an undue hardship, if the property owner or other interested party wishes to assert that the true intent and meaning of the code has been misconstrued or misinterpreted, or if the property owner or other interested party desires to make any other argument, the parties have a right to a hearing before the Code Enforcement Board. Any request for a hearing before the Code Enforcement Board must be made in writing within seven days of receipt of Notice of Violation; otherwise the right to a hearing is waived. 
b.  Recordation of notice. A Notice of Pending Administrative Action shall be recorded with the Clerk of Court, served upon the property owner and other interested party as indicated below, and containing the name of the property owner, the specific violation of Section 1-4.7 of the City Code and the property address and legal description. 
c.  Service of Notice of Violation and Notice of Pending Administrative Action. The Notice of Violation with any and all attachments and the Notice of Pending Administrative Action shall be served upon the property owner by posting a copy of each Notice of Violation and Notice of Pending Administrative Action upon the property in a conspicuous place and where practical by hand delivery or where not practical or impossible by certified mail, return receipt requested, to each interested party of record at the address as it appears in the public records. If the addresses are not available on any interested party, the notices addressed to such person shall be mailed to the address of the building or structure involved in the proceedings. If the notice addressed to the owner of record is returned for any reason, then service shall be affected by posting the notices in accordance with F.S. Ch. 162. The failure of any person, other than the owner of record, to receive notice shall not invalidate proceedings under this section. Service by certified mail shall be effective on the date the notices were received as indicated on the return receipt. Proof of service shall be by written declaration indicating the date, time, and manner in which service was made. 
4.  Hearing. 
a.  Scope of hearing. A hearing before the Code Enforcement Board shall offer the property owner and other legally interested parties a reasonable opportunity to be heard on any matter or issue which is relevant to the case. The property owner or other interested parties may appear at the hearing in person or through an attorney or other designated representative. Failure of any person to appear at a hearing scheduled in accordance with the City Code shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing on the Notice of Violation. 
b.  Implementation. 
1)  If no hearing is requested as provided in subsection 3.a.(6), the Building Official may take action to remove or demolish the building or structure as directed by the City Manager. 
2)  If a hearing is requested and the Code Enforcement Board determines: 
A)  That the condition exists as set forth in the Notice of Violation, and that the remedial action required in the notice has not been voluntarily completed by the property owner, or other legally interested party, the Code Enforcement Board shall issue a written order authorizing the Building Official to remove or demolish the building or structure, or cause the removal or demolition of the building or structure. 
B)  That the condition, as set forth in the Notice of Violation, does not exist or has been corrected as required by the Notice of Violation, the Notice of Violation shall be dismissed by written order of the Code Enforcement Board. 
c.  Appeal of decisions of the Code Enforcement Board. Any property owner aggrieved by a decision of the Code Enforcement Board may apply to the City Commission for relief within ten days after rendition of the written decision and payment of an application fee as determined by Resolution of the City Commission. The appeal before the City Commission shall be a certiorari review, based solely on the record of the hearing before the Code Enforcement Board. The appellant is responsible for providing the City Commission with a verbatim transcript of the hearing. The proceedings before the Code Enforcement Board, including all exhibits, the transcribed testimony of witnesses, and the findings of the Code Enforcement Board shall be the subject of review by the City Commission. The appeal shall be subject to the procedures outlined in subsection D(2) and (3) of Section 1-2.1, except that: 
1)  References to the Board of Adjustment shall be to the City Commission; and 
2)  Appeals from the City Commission decision shall be to the Circuit Court. 
5.  The Building Official may, upon written request of the property owner, grant an extension of time as the Building Official may determine to be reasonable to complete the required remedial action. If the extensions of time, in total, exceed 120 days, the extension must also be approved by the Code Enforcement Board which may act without further public hearing. 
6.  Interference. No person shall obstruct or interfere with the implementation of any action required by the final notice of the Building Official or the Code Enforcement Board. Any person found interfering or obstructing such actions shall be prosecuted to the extent provided for by law. 
7.  Performance of work. The demolition of a building or structure, as required in the notice by the Building Official or the final Order by the Code Enforcement Board, shall be performed in an expeditious and workmanlike manner in accordance with the requirements of the City Code, Florida Building Code and all other applicable codes and accepted engineering practice standards. 
8.  Recovery of costs and fines. 
a.  Costs and fines assessed to owner. Whenever a building or structure is removed or demolished in accordance with the provisions of this Code and the cost of such removal or demolition is borne by the City, such cost shall be assessed to the owner of the affected land or premises and shall become a lien against such land or premises as provided in this Article. The cost of repair or demolition shall include not only the costs directly attributable to the repair or demolition of the building or structure, but shall also include the cost incurred in searching the public records to determine the record owners and legally interested parties, as well as any reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs incurred in the administrative enforcement of this Section and/or any legal proceeding arising from the City's abatement under this Section, whether brought by the City, property owner or any other legally interested party, and where the City is the prevailing party in such actions. 
b.  Building Official to certify costs. The Building Official shall certify the costs borne by the City, as described above, and shall serve such cost certification upon the property owner by certified mail return receipt requested. This cost certification is a demand for payment from the property owner. 
c.  Right to hearing if cost and charges excessive. Prior to the expiration of 15 days from the property owner's receipt of the Building Official's cost certification, the property owner shall have the right to appeal the Building Official's cost certification and request a hearing before the Code Enforcement Board to show cause, if any, why the costs and charges incurred by the City under this Section are excessive or unwarranted, provided that nothing contained in this Section is to be construed to disturb or permit a review of the order by the Code Enforcement Board issued under subsection 4.b above. 
Failure of the property owner to seek an appeal of the Building Official's cost certification, as described in this division, shall constitute a waiver by the property owner, and shall cause the cost certification to be final. 
d.  Lien created. If the owner fails to make payment within 15 days from the expiration of the appeal period, or from the date of any Order entered by the City Code Enforcement Board under subsection (c) above, the amount of the certified costs shall be assessed by the Building Official or by the Order of the Code Enforcement Board against the affected land and such assessment shall create and constitute a lien against such land, payable to the City. Said assessment shall bear interest at the current legal rate of interest per annum as provided by law and shall constitute a lien upon the land from the date of the assessment and shall be collectible in the same manner as liens for taxes and with the same attorneys' fees, penalties for default in payment, and under the same provisions as to sale and forfeiture. Collection of such assessments, with such interest and with a reasonable attorney's fee, may also be made by the City Commission by proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to foreclose the lien of the assessment in the manner in which a lien for mortgages is foreclosed under the laws of the State and it shall be lawful to join in any complaint for foreclosure any one or more lots or parcels of land, by whomever owned, if assessed under the provisions of this Section. Property subject to the lien may be redeemed at any time prior to sale by its owner by paying the total amount due under the corresponding assessment lien including interest, court costs, advertising costs and reasonable attorney's fees. 
9.  Authority to expend funds. Nothing contained herein shall require the City Commission to appropriate or expend any funds to carry out the purpose of this Section. The authority granted herein is permissive and shall not be construed to impose an obligation on the Building Official or the City to condemn or demolish any building or structure. 
10.  Provisions supplemental and in addition to other powers. The provisions of this Section shall not be deemed to repeal or modify any City ordinance, provision of the City Code, Florida Building Code or Florida Fire Prevention Code relating to condemnation, demolition of buildings and structures, or abatement of unsafe conditions or imminent hazards but the provisions herein shall be supplemental and in addition to the powers that may be exercised by the City Commission, its officers and employees.

2.  Procedures for review shall be the same procedures used in review of a conditional use. 
3.  In addition, the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Commission shall determine: (1) whether the use is similar in character to other uses cited in the specific land use classification; and (2) whether the impacts generated by the use are similar in character to the impact generated by other uses cited in the specific land use classification. 
ARTICLE V. - ZONING DISTRICT REGULATIONS 

Section 2-5.1. - Introduction. 
    This Article describes the purposes and intent of each zoning district, identifies permitted and conditional uses by zoning district, and provides size and dimensional regulations for respective zoning districts. All proposed new development shall be required to comply with site plan review (ref. Article XVIII) and applicable performance criteria (ref. Chapter III). 
    In addition, all development shall be directed toward the following: 
1.  Protecting the quality and character of existing neighborhoods, including compatibility of land use and structures and excluding transient accommodations; 
2.  Preserving open space; 
3.  Maintaining densities which are compatible with existing and anticipated future developments; 
4.  Requiring that new development provide public facilities which meet adopted level of service criteria consistent with provisions of Article IX; 
5.  Promoting compatibility with natural features of the land; and 
6.  Allowing supportive community facilities cited in Table 2-5.3 as well as accessory uses to the principal residential use. 
    The location and distribution of specific types of nonresidential activities shall be determined based on the following considerations: 
1.  Trip generation characteristics, including impact on transportation facilities and offstreet parking systems; 
2.  Location and site requirements based on specific needs of respective commercial activities, their market area, anticipated employment generation and floor area requirements; 
3.  Compatibility with and impact on nearby residential and other surrounding commercial activities; 
4.  Relationship to surrounding land uses and natural systems; and 
5.  Impact on existing and planned community services and utilities. 
Section 2-5.2. - Purpose and intent of zoning districts. 
    This Section presents the basic purpose and intent of each zoning district. 
A.  Residential zoning districts. The overall purpose and intent of residential zoning districts are to provide a management framework for implementing Comprehensive Plan residential development objectives and policies. 
All residential development shall comply with the Comprehensive Plan, with performance criteria in Chapters III and IV, as well as with all other applicable land development regulations. Notwithstanding, single-family and two-family dwellings shall not be required to comply with site plan review procedures, but must comply with surface water management criteria as well as any other applicable performance criteria. The maximum density is not guaranteed by rights. Instead, the maximum density shall be determined based on a site-specific assessment, including consideration of the natural characteristics of the site as well as performance standards stipulated in Chapter III. Following is a description of the intended purpose of each zoning district herein established, including reference to the Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map designations which shall be implemented through the land development regulations: 
1.  Low density single-family residential zoning district (R-12.5, R-9, and R-8, RMH-8). These zoning districts are established to implement Comprehensive Plan policies for low density residential (LDR) land use designation delineated on the Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map. These zoning districts, except the RMH-8, are designed to accommodate conventional single-family permanent residential development. The RMH-8 district is intended to accommodate mobile homes. 
The maximum allowable residential density for development within these designations shall be five dwelling units per gross acre and the minimum lot size is denoted below: 
District Minimum Lot Size R-12.5 12,500 sq. ft. R-9  9,000 sq. ft. R-8  8,000 sq. ft. RMH-8  8,000 sq. ft.  
Specific density on a site will be determined by such factors as natural features of the land, existing density and/or intensity of surrounding development, level of accessibility, adequacy of public facilities, and other factors identified in the land development regulations. 
2.  Planned residential development zoning district (PRD). The PRD zoning district is established to implement Comprehensive Plan policies which promote cluster residential development and innovative, high quality residential design within the "Low Density Residential," "Medium Density Residential" and "High Density Residential" land use designations delineated on the Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map (FLUM). The maximum allowable density shall not exceed five units per acre in areas designated Residential Low Density on the Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map. The maximum allowable density shall not exceed 13 units per acre in areas designated Residential Medium Density on the Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map. The maximum allowable density shall not exceed 20 units per acre, or 25 units/acre with density bonuses, in areas designated Residential High Density on the Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map. 
The PRD is designed to accommodate cluster residential development in order to provide innovative, high quality residential design, preserve open space, including environmentally sensitive land, and in order to concentrate development within developable uplands. The purpose is to encourage flexible cluster design techniques, such as townhouses, attached patio homes, zero lot lines, and other similar design techniques while preserving greater amounts of open space than can generally be achieved through conventional single-family detached units on standard lots. Within areas designated Residential Low Density on the Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map, attached dwelling and two-family development shall not be permitted. 
Planned Residential Developments (PRD) shall be available for multi-family residential development in areas where urban services are readily available and in order to concentrate development within areas designated as suitable for high-density development. The purpose of this district is to encourage high standards of design, while protecting adjacent areas of lower density development. Such residential development shall be located in proximity to commercial centers, with safe and adequate pedestrian access and access to mass transit service. Density bonuses shall be available to properties with a future land designation of High Density Residential as an incentive for the provision of additional open space; public lake access; provision of mass transit facilities; and high standards of residential design. 
3.  Medium density single/two-family residential zoning district (R-2F). The R-2F zoning district is established to implement Comprehensive Plan policies for medium density residential (MDR) land use designation. Lots for single-family residential units shall be no less than 8,000 square feet. Lots for two-family residential units shall be 9,000 square feet. This zoning district is designed to accommodate single- and two-family residential units. 
4.  Medium density multifamily residential zoning district (RMF-13). The RMF-13 zoning district is established to implement Comprehensive Plan policies for land use areas designated "MDR" on the Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map (FLUM). The RMF-13 zoning district is intended to accommodate multifamily residential development with a maximum density of 13 units per acre. 
Review of specific densities of developments shall be directed toward preserving stability of established residential areas. Sites for medium density residential developments should be located so that they provide a smooth transition between lower density residential areas and areas developed and/or designated for other more intense uses. Generally, medium density residential development should be located between the perimeter of low density residential areas and more intense development. 
5.  High density multifamily residential zoning district (RMF-20). The RmF-20 zoning district is established to implement Comprehensive Plan policies for land use areas designated "HDR" on the Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map (FLUM). The RMF-20 zoning district is intended to accommodate multifamily residential developments which exceed a maximum density of 13 units per acre in order to recognize existing development patterns and allow such established land uses within a conforming zoning district. 
Sites for high density residential developments should be located so that they provide a smooth transition between low and medium density residential area and areas developed and/or designated for other more intense uses. Generally, high-density residential development should be located between the perimeter of low and medium density residential areas and more intense development such as commercial or industrial areas. 
B.  Commercial zoning districts. The overall purpose and intent of commercial zoning districts are to provide a management framework for implementing Comprehensive Plan commercial development objectives and policies. 
All commercial development shall comply with the Comprehensive Plan, performance criteria in Chapters III and IV, as well as all other applicable land development regulations. Table 2-5.3 cites the allowable commercial uses, accessory uses, and appropriate facilities allowed within each commercial zoning district. Following is a description of the intended purpose of each zoning district herein established, including reference to the Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map designation which shall be implemented through the land development regulations. 
Properties zoned for commercial development shall be designed to minimize negative impacts upon adjacent residential areas as well as upon the roadway network, by incorporating appropriate traffic control and urban design measures. Such measures shall include appropriate site design, landscape and buffering techniques. 
1.  Office/residential zoning district (OR). The zoning district is established to implement Comprehensive Plan policies for areas designated "Commercial" (C) on the Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map (FLUM). The OR zoning district is intended to accommodate business and professional offices as well as single-family and two-family dwellings incidental to the office use. 
The allowable maximum residential density shall be 13 units per acre. The maximum intensity of office or mixed-use development shall not exceed a floor area ratio (FAR) of 0.2 inclusive of all residential and nonresidential floor area. The OR zoning district expressly excludes transient lodging and guest homes as well as all other commercial development, excepting business and professional offices. 
Consistent with Comprehensive Plan policies, development within the OR zoning district shall include perimeter landscaping and screening consisting of a vegetative berm system, where feasible, including an upper-story tree canopy and lower-story hedge or shrubbery, and/or an aesthetic decorative fence or wall to ensure privacy and promote compatibility among existing and anticipated future residential uses and office developments. Landscaping, screening and buffering shall be applied to ensure smooth transition between differing residential structure types and densities. 
2.  Limited commercial zoning district (CL). The CL zoning district is established to implement Comprehensive Plan land use policies for areas designated "Commercial" on the Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map (FLUM). The CL zoning district is intended to accommodate limited commercial development which shall include shops catering primarily to the following markets: 
a.  Neighborhood residential markets within the immediate vicinity as opposed to Citywide or regional markets. 
b.  Specialized markets with customized market demands and limited inventory as opposed to larger full service or large-scale discount operations. 
Commercial development within the CL zoning district shall be restricted to those uses identified in Table 2-5.3. Uses which are not intended to be accommodated within the limited commercial area include the following: large-scale discount stores or supermarkets; department stores; wholesale and warehousing activities; sales, service or repair of motor vehicles, machine equipment or accessory parts, including tire and battery shops; automotive services centers; and fast food establishments primarily serving in disposable containers and/or providing drive-in facilities. In addition, the CL zoning district is not intended to accommodate transient residential uses, including motels or hotels.

Section 2-5.4. - Size and dimension criteria. 
A.  Minimum lot or site requirements for all uses. Table 2-5.4 incorporates required size and dimension regulations which shall be applicable within each respective zoning district. All developments shall have a total land area sufficient to satisfy all standards stipulated within the land development regulations, including but not limited to: 
  Minimum lot and setback requirements; 
  Open space, buffers, and landscaping; 
  Surface water management and flood damage prevention; 
  Public facilities requirements; 
  Access, internal circulation and offstreet parking; 
  Wetland protection; 
  Soil erosion and sedimentation control standards; 
  Exterior appearance and structural quality; 
  Shoreline protection; 
  Preservation of upland vegetation as well as marine, fisheries and wildlife habitats, especially those supporting flora and fauna species that are threatened, endangered or of special concern; 
  Preservation of historical and archaeological resources; and 
  Nuisance abatement criteria. 
    Conventional single-family lots shall meet square footage requirements stipulated in Table 2-5.4. Similarly, development within other specified nonresidential districts shall maintain sites meeting size and dimension requirements stipulated in Table 2-5.4. 
B.  Density and intensity of land use. Density and intensity shall be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. The density and intensity expressed in Table 2-5.4 is the maximum density/intensity which can be achieved, given by type of land use. However, the maximum density/intensity is not guaranteed by right. Instead, the maximum density shall be determined based on a site-specific assessment, including consideration of the natural characteristics of the site as well as performance standards stipulated in Chapter III. 
    Gross residential density is calculated by dividing the "maximum allowable units" by the "gross area of land" (i.e., dwelling units/gross land area). Gross land area shall be defined as contiguous land area under common ownership, as identified in the development plan. 
    Residential density shall be determined by dividing the "maximum allowable units" by the "net developable acres of land" (i.e., dwelling units/net land area). All residential densities stipulate the maximum net densities. Net land area shall be defined as developable contiguous land area under common ownership as identified in the development plan. 
    Where the state or federal government provides for development rights within environmentally sensitive wetlands under state or federal jurisdiction, density shall in no case exceed one unit per five acres. Development options shall be based on physical and biological data obtained from specific site investigations. These determinations shall be predicated on findings rendered by professionals competent in producing data and analysis necessary to support environmental impact assessments, including findings regarding the impacts of potential development on the physical and biological value and function of environmentally sensitive lands. This Section shall not prevent, as a minimum, a single-family home from being built on a legal lot of record where state and federal agencies having jurisdiction approve such development which is specifically identified in the development plan. 
    In reviewing site plan applications for development of particular building sites, the specific residential density approved by the City shall include the following considerations: 
  Protect neighborhood cohesiveness and stability of residential characters; 
  Ensure compatible transitions in land use density and intensity; 
  Protect environmentally sensitive areas, particularly wetlands and floodplains; 
  Minimize impacts of flood hazards to development; 
  Require that all applicable land development regulations are satisfied including, but not limited to, performance criteria of Chapter III; and 
  Ensure that the number of units proposed is suitable for the site and that the site plan incorporates design features which are consistent with the requirements of the land development regulations. 
    The maximum intensity stipulated for nonresidential activities is stated in terms of floor area ratio. Floor area ratio (FAR) refers to the total floor area of building(s) on any lot, parcel, or site divided by the area of the lot, parcel, or site. For purposes of calculating floor area, parking area located beneath the building shall not be counted unless the clear height of the parking area exceeds seven feet. In the latter instance, the parking area shall be calculated as floor area in the FAR computation. FAR computations shall include all uses on the lot, parcel, or site, including both residential and nonresidential floor area. 
FLOOR AREA RATIO ILLUSTRATION 

FLOOR AREA RATIO (FAR) 
FAR = Total Building Floor Area / Total Lot Area 
    The City shall reserve the power to mandate changes in the site plan as well as mandate reductions in the density and/or intensity of development proposed by an applicant/developer if the City finds that the proposed site plan does not satisfy provisions of the Comprehensive Plan and/or the land development regulations. 
C.  Potable water and wastewater services. Reference Article IX of the land development regulations. 
D.  Impervious surface requirements (ISR) for all uses. The term "impervious surface" is defined as that portion of the land which is covered by buildings, pavement, or other cover through which water cannot penetrate. The impervious surface ratio requirement controls the intensity of development, by restricting the amount of the land covered by any type of impervious surface. 
1.  Compliance with ISR stipulated in Table 2-5.4. All proposed development shall comply with the standards given in the table of impervious surface ratios in Table 2-5.4. 
Where a proposed development is donating or dedicating land based on a plan approved by the City, the gross site before dedication or donation shall be used to calculate ISR. This does not relieve the applicant from providing all required onsite buffers, landscaping, stormwater management areas, setbacks, and other required project amenities. 
2.  Calculation of ISR. The impervious surface ratio (ISR) is calculated for the gross site by dividing the total impervious surface by the gross site area. Water bodies, including retention/detention areas, are impervious and shall be included as such in the ISR calculation. 
Cluster development or other site design alternatives may result in individual lots exceeding the ISR, while other lots may be devoted entirely to open space. The City may require, as a condition of approval, deed restrictions or covenants which guarantee the maintenance of such open space in perpetuity. The ISR requirement shall not be bypassed or reduced. However, the intent is to allow maximum flexibility through calculating ISR on the gross site, and not on a lot-by-lot basis. 
3.  Use of porous material. Porous concrete, porous asphalt, "turf block," or similar materials may be used subject to approval of the City Engineer. 
The burden of proof shall reside with the applicant. The applicant shall demonstrate that the material is designed consistent with accepted industry specifications. The material shall be designed to retain its porosity, stability, and durability for a reasonable period of time based on professionally accepted principles and practices. 
E.  Building yards. Table 2-5.4 provides building yards for conventional single-family lots as well as for nonresidential sites. The yards shall be measured from the subject lot lines of the building site. 
    A variance to these yards may be granted by the Planning and Zoning Commission if the applicant meets the requirements of Section 1-2.7, herein, and the standards for considering variances of Section 1-2.7(C) and the following additional standards: 
1.  The reduced yard is consistent with the established yard on existing developed lots within the general vicinity; 
2.  The reduced yard will not adversely impact adjacent land uses; 
3.  The reduced yard will not adversely impact any planned acquisition of needed public rights-of-way which may be identified on the City's official street name map; 
4.  The proposed development with the reduced yard is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan, land development regulations and does not adversely impact the public's general health, safety, and welfare; 
5.  The reduced yard shall not allow encroachment on existing easements.

ARTICLE VI. - CONDITIONAL USE CRITERIA 

Section 2-6.1. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this Article is to ensure that conditional uses shall only be permitted on specific sites where the proposed use may be adequately accommodated, without generating adverse impacts on properties and land uses within the immediate vicinity. This Section is intended to provide the procedures and criteria for considering the approval of conditional uses on specific sites within various zoning districts. Conditional uses shall be permitted upon a finding that the respective use and proposed site plan satisfy the provisions of this Article. 
Section 2-6.2. - Specific criteria for approving a conditional use. 
    A conditional use shall be permitted only upon a finding that the proposed conditional use, application, and applicable performance criteria (ref. Chapter III) comply with the criteria herein specified unless the City determines that the proposed conditional use does not meet the criteria herein provided and that the proposed conditional use is adverse to the public's interest. In addition, the site plan criteria of an application for a conditional use shall describe the proposed land use characteristics and site plan techniques proposed to mitigate against possible adverse impacts to properties in the immediate vicinity. 
A.  Characteristics of use described. The following characteristics of a proposed conditional use shall be clearly described as part of the conditional use application: 
1.  Scale and intensity of use as measured by the following: 
a.  Floor area ratio; 
b.  Traffic generation; 
c.  Square feet of enclosed building for each specific use; 
d.  Proposed employment; 
e.  Proposed number and type of service vehicles; and 
f.  Offstreet parking needs. 
2.  On- or offsite improvement needs generated by the proposed use, including: 
a.  On- or offsite facilities required to service the proposed use such as utilities, public facilities, roadway or signalization improvements, or other similar improvements, including proposed accessory structures or facilities; and 
b.  Other unique facilities/structures proposed as part of site improvements. 
3.  Onsite amenities proposed to enhance the site and planned improvements. Amenities include mitigative techniques such as open space, setbacks from adjacent properties, screening and buffers, including landscaped berms proposed to mitigate against adverse impacts to adjacent sites. 
B.  Criteria for conditional use review and approval. In addition to site plan procedures (ref. Article XVIII) and performance criteria (ref. Chapter III), applications for a conditional use shall clearly demonstrate the following: 
1.  Land use compatibility. The applicant shall demonstrate that the conditional use, including its proposed scale and intensity, traffic generating characteristics, and offsite impacts, are compatible and harmonious with adjacent land use, and will not adversely impact land use activities in the immediate vicinity. 
2.  Sufficient site size and adequate site specifications to accommodate the proposed use. The size and shape of the site, the proposed access and internal circulation, and the urban design enhancements must be adequate to accommodate the proposed scale and intensity of conditional use requested. The site shall be of sufficient size to accommodate urban design amenities such as screening, buffers, landscaping, open space, offstreet parking, efficient internal traffic circulation, and similar site plan improvements needed to mitigate against potential adverse impacts of the proposed use. 
3.  Proper use of mitigative techniques. The applicant shall demonstrate that the conditional use and site plan has been designed to incorporate mitigative techniques needed to prevent adverse impacts to adjacent land uses. In addition, the design scheme shall appropriately address offsite impacts to ensure that land use activities in the immediate vicinity, including community infrastructure, are not burdened with adverse impacts detrimental to the general public health, safety and welfare. 
4.  Hazardous waste. The proposed use shall not generate hazardous waste or required use of hazardous materials in its operation without use of City-approved mitigative techniques designed to prevent any adverse impact to the general health, safety and welfare. The plan shall provide for appropriate identification of hazardous waste and hazardous material, and regulate its use, storage and transfer consistent with best management principles and practices. No use which generates hazardous waste or uses hazardous materials shall be located in the City unless the specific location is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan policies and land development regulations, and does not adversely impact wellfields, aquifer recharge areas, or other conservation resources. 
5.  Compliance with applicable laws and ordinances. A conditional use application shall demonstrate compliance with all applicable federal, state, county, and City laws and ordinances. Where permits are required from governmental agencies other than the City, these permits shall be obtained as a condition of approval. 
Section 2-6.3. - Review procedures. 
    The application for a conditional use on a form to be provided by the Department of Community Development shall be submitted to the Department of Community Development with the site plan required pursuant to Article XVIII. The procedure for approval shall be the same as for the procedures identified in Article XVIII for site plan review. 
ARTICLE VII. - GENERAL REGULATIONS 

Section 2-7.1. - Applicability of provisions. 
    The land development regulations set by this Chapter shall apply uniformly to each district, class or kind of structure or land except as hereinafter provided. 
Section 2-7.2. - Restrictions on buildings and structures. 
    No building or other structure shall hereafter be erected or altered which does not conform to size and dimension requirements stipulated in Article V (Table 2-5.3) or which does not conform to all other applicable land development regulations. 
Section 2-7.3. - Independent yard or open space. 
    No part of any yard, open space, offstreet parking, or loading space required in connection with any building or site for the purpose of complying with land development regulations shall be included as part of a yard, open space, offstreet parking or loading space similarly required for any other building or site, nor shall any required yard, open space, offstreet parking or loading space required in connection with any building or site be transferred to enable another building or site to meet its respective requirements; nor shall land, required yard, open space, offstreet parking or loading space for any building or site be included for consideration for development rights credit for another site. 
(Ord. No. 02-1045, § 8, 5-13-02) 
Section 2-7.4. - Yard and building site requirements. 
    No lot, building site, or required yard shall be reduced in dimension or area below the minimum requirements set forth herein. 
Section 2-7.5. - Distance between principal buildings. 
    The minimum distance between principal buildings for four or more residential units or commercial buildings shall be 30 feet. The distance shall be measured at the narrowest space between buildings and shall not include roof overhang. This requirement may be modified if the Fire Marshal recommends a lesser distance based on considerations cited in the National Fire Protection Association Code (NFPA) and NFPA advisory standards. Any request for modification of the requirement must also be accompanied by a staff recommendation, including the comments of the Fire Marshal. The burden of proof in demonstrating the need for a modified yard requirement shall be on the applicant. 
Section 2-7.6. - Lots of record less than minimum size. 
    Any nonconforming lot of record at the time of the adoption of this ordinance which contains less lot area or width than required in the district in which it is located may be used for a use permitted in such district. The provision shall not be construed to permit more than one dwelling unit on a lot with less area per family than required for the district in which such lot is located. However, if the substandard lot adjoins other land under the same ownership which if used could correct the nonconforming lot area or width, then: 
1.  The substandard lot shall not be permitted a vested development right unless the nonconformity is remedied; and, furthermore, 
2.  Any subsequent sale or ownership transfer of the substandard lot, adjoining lot, or portion thereof shall not result in a vested development right in the subject substandard lot(s) unless the transaction corrects deficiencies in the substandard lot(s). 
Section 2-7.7. - Regulations for required yards. 
A.  Purpose, use and maintenance of yards. The purpose of yards required in this Chapter is to provide open space around and between structures for health, safety and aesthetic purposes. The purpose is also to prevent structures within dedicated easements. All required yards and landscaped areas where not used for parking, driveways, sidewalks, or other approved structures shall be planted and maintained in lawn, sod, or landscaping including flower beds, shrubs, hedges or other generally accepted landscaping material approved by the City. Landscaping material, including trees, shall not obstruct the vision of the motoring public as established in F.S. §§ 71.090-71.092. The landscape requirements of Article XIII shall further regulate development within all zoning districts, excepting single-family zoned districts. 
B.  Required yard measurements. Required yards shall be measured on a perpendicular to the property line to the first vertical plane which intersects any portion of the structure other than a nominal roof overhang. On irregular lots, the side yards shall be measured from the front building line when the lot frontage is narrower than the rear of the lot, and from the rear building line when the rear of the lot is narrower than the front of the lot. 
    The building line shall be determined from the extreme support of the roof of the main structure or appurtenance thereto. On front, side, and rear yards, a roof projection or eaves shall not exceed 36 inches. 
C.  General encroachments into required yards. Every part of every required yard shall be open and unobstructed from the ground to the sky except as hereinafter provided or as otherwise permitted in the land development regulations: 
1.  Sills or belt courses may not project over 18 inches into a required yard; 
2.  Movable awnings may not project over three feet into a required yard, provided that where the yard is less than five feet in width the projection shall not exceed one-half the width of the yard; 
3.  Chimneys, fireplaces or pilasters may not project over two feet into a required yard; 
4.  Fire escapes, stairways, and balconies which are unroofed and unenclosed may project not over five feet into a required rear yard, or not over three feet into a required side yard of a multiple dwelling, hotel or motel; 
5.  Hoods, canopies, or marquees may not project over three feet into a required yard; 
6.  Fences, walls and hedges shall be permitted in required yards subject to the provisions established herein; and 
7.  Accessory parking may be located in a required front, rear or side yard except that no parking shall be permitted within 15 feet of a public street; 
8.  Play equipment, wires, lights, mailboxes, ornamental entry columns and gates, and outdoor furniture are not considered encroachments; 
9.  Docks and other waterfront accessory structures approved by the City Engineer in compliance with the City's land development regulations are not considered yard encroachments. 
D.  Front yards. 
1.  Lots with double frontage. Front yard regulations shall apply to both streets on through lots and double-frontage lots. 
2.  Corner lots. There shall be a front yard on each street side of a corner lot, provided, however, that the buildable width of such lot shall not be reduced to less than 30 feet; provided, further, that no building on a corner lot shall project beyond the front yard line on either street. 
3.  Encroachment of porches or terraces. An open unenclosed and uncovered porch or paved terrace may project into the front yard for a distance of not more than ten feet. 
E.  Side yard. Width of required side yards shall be measured in such a manner that the yard established is a strip of at least the minimum width required by district regulations with its inner edge parallel with the side lot line. 
F.  Rear yard. Depth of required rear yards shall be measured in such a manner that the yard established is a strip of at least the minimum width required by district regulations with its inner edge parallel with the rear lot line. 
G.  Yard encroachment by shading. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the land development regulations, no new building, or manmade object will be located in such a manner that it will cast a shadow (damaging to the use of a solar system) into adjacent required yard setbacks, between the hours of 8:00 a.m. E.S.T. and 4:00 p.m. E.S.T. at the winter solstice. The purpose of this is to enhance the natural warming during winter months for plant life and habitat on adjoining property as well as safeguarding the users of solar heating roof panels. 
H.  Yard abutting alley. Whenever a lot abuts on an alley, one-half of the alley width may be considered as a portion of the required rear yard. 
(Ord. No. 02-1045, § 9, 5-13-02) 
Section 2-7.8. - Erection of more than one principal structure on a lot. 
    In any district, more than one structure housing a permitted or permissible principal use may be erected on a single lot, provided that yard and other requirements of the zoning provisions shall be met for each such structure on a separate lot.

Section 2-7.10. - Fences and walls. 
    Any wall or fence erected within the City shall meet professionally accepted building standards and the regulations cited below. 
    For the purpose of this Code the term "fence" shall be used to describe a manmade structure erected for separation, security or privacy purposes through the means of intermittent posts supporting vertical or horizontal members made of wood, metal, vinyl, aluminum, chain link, or barbed wire. While the opacity may vary, the height and location are dictated by the regulations within this ordinance. 
    A wall may be erected for the same purposes but shall include only those structures with continuous footers. The main structure of the wall may be constructed of brick, stone or concrete block. The wall construction may be used in combination with decorative veneers of brick, rock, stone, stucco or any other material meeting accepted aesthetic performance criteria. 
A.  Building permit required. No fence or wall shall be erected, replaced or receive major repair until a permit for same has been issued. The Administrative Official shall determine the types of fence or wall repair that are major and require a building permit. 
B.  Commercial or industrial fences. Fences or walls may be erected in any commercial or industrial district to provide buffering. The fence height shall not exceed eight feet above the finished grade. Fences constructed with chain link shall use vinyl clad chain link, either green or black. When other materials are used for fencing, the finished side shall face out. Walls shall be finished similarly on both sides. Barbed wire or similar materials may be used in an industrial district provided the use is limited to a maximum of three strands installed a minimum of six feet above the finished grade. Barbed wire may be used in a commercial district provided a conditional use is granted by the Administrative Official and the use is limited to a maximum of three strands installed a minimum of six feet above the finished grade. 
C.  Residential fences or walls. In any residential district, no fence or wall shall be erected or project beyond the property line. For the purpose of this section of the code, a front yard is defined as the area between those property lines adjacent to the street and the principal structure. No wall or fence in excess of three feet may be maintained within a front yard as indicated in the detail below. 

1.  Front yard fences. Fences within the front yard forward of the front building line of the main building shall be limited to a maximum height of three feet; provided, however, that they be of approved, open decorative type construction, such as open chain link, wood, vinyl, aluminum, or split rail fencing. 
2.  Side and rear yard fences. Side and rear yard fences or walls may be erected or maintained to a maximum height of eight feet above the finished grade. Fences located in the rear yard of through lots may not be located closer than ten feet to the adjacent street. 
3.  Through lots. For the purpose of this section of the fence/wall requirements regarding a residential through lot, the front yard regulations shall apply only to the main street of the property. The main street shall be determined by factors including the address of the house, the location of the main entrance of the house, the location of the driveway, and the orientation of the front yards of adjacent properties. It is the intent of this regulation to allow a fenced rear yard on such properties without the need for a variance. In cases where the orientation of the front and rear yards are not consistent with the majority of properties on the same street, a variance will be required. Corner lot regulations still apply to those properties which are through lots as well as corner lots. See detail below which shows Street A as the main street. 

4.  Material. All fences or walls shall be constructed from approved material enumerated herein and shall be erected with the finished side facing out. Barbed wire or similar materials shall not be allowed in any residential districts. 
5.  Undeveloped properties. Undeveloped residential properties may be fenced upon approval by the Administrative Official of the location and material type. 
6.  Non-compliant fences and walls. Legally existing non-compliant fences and walls on residential properties may be replaced, restored, or reconstructed as originally permitted. Such replacement, restoration, or reconstruction shall adhere to the current permitting requirements expressed within this section. The burden of proof in establishing the legal non-compliant status of an existing fence or wall rests solely with the applicant. Those applicants who are unable to effectively prove such legal noncompliance shall be subject to the current fence and wall regulations of this section. 
7.  Fence and wall locations. There shall only be one fence or one wall per perimeter, per property. A new fence or wall shall not be erected directly adjacent to an existing fence or wall on the same lot. 
8.  Appearance. Fences shall present a uniform appearance. Attachments to increase the height or length of an existing fence shall be of the same material, color, and design as the existing fence.

Section 2-7.31. - Eminent domain waivers, exceptions and variances. 
(A)  Findings of fact. The City Commission hereby finds that the acquiring of private property by various governmental or public agency entities, so authorized by law through the eminent domain process, through trial, or negotiations prior thereto, is an extremely costly and burdensome process. Allowing the appropriate City Administrative Official, pursuant to established guidelines, procedures and criteria, to grant waivers and exceptions from certain City land development codes or regulations, or to apply for variances on behalf of affected property owners serves a valid public purpose and promotes the general safety and welfare of the citizens and land owners of the City. 
(B)  Intent. It is the intent of this article to establish fair procedures by which the appropriate City staff can grant waivers and exceptions to City land development, sign and engineering codes and regulations, where appropriate, or to seek such waivers or variances before the appropriate boards, in order that property owners who have been subjected to the condemnation process have a viable and fair alternative in preventing any adverse impact upon their property as a result of the condemnation process and allow the continued use of their property in a manner similar to its pre-condemnation condition. Further, it is the intent of this section to establish procedures which will reduce the cost of acquisitions of real property needed for public improvements. 
(C)  Authority of department directors. The Administrative Official or designee(s), shall have the authority to grant waivers or exceptions, or to seek variances on behalf of owners of property from applicable codes, ordinances, regulations, or resolutions. The Administrative Official or designee shall provide a copy of the determination letter to the City Attorney's office if the property is in a condemnation lawsuit, or in pre-suit negotiations, stating that the waiver or exception does not adversely affect the public health, safety or welfare. 
(D)  Application for waivers, exceptions and variances. 
(1)  The condemning authority, or the landowner, may apply in writing to the Administrative Official or designee for a determination that the granting of the waiver or exception will not result in a condition which adversely affects the health, safety or welfare of the general public. 
(2)  The Administrative Official or designee shall, within 30 days of receipt of the application, issue a signed letter to all parties granting or denying the waiver or exception. 
(3)  If the waiver or exception is denied by the Administrative Official or designee, the owner or condemning authority may apply for, at no cost to the owner, a variance before the appropriate board. 
(E)  Waivers, exceptions and variances. If, as a result of a governmental taking, either by negotiation or condemnation, existing lots, parcels, structures, or uses of land become nonconforming with the provisions of the City code, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Existing characteristics of use which become nonconforming or increase in nonconformity as a result of a taking, including but not limited to, minimum lot size, setbacks, open space, off-street parking, landscape requirements, drainage and retention shall be required to meet code requirements to the greatest extent possible, to the satisfaction of the Administrative Official or designee. Thereafter, the existing characteristic of use shall be deemed conforming only to the extent of those nonconformities caused by the governmental or public agency's acquisition. Waivers, exceptions or variances shall: 
a.  Provide at least 70 percent of the required parking. 
b.  Maintain at least 50 percent of the required front yard. 
c.  Provide, at the minimum, a five-foot street front landscape strip. The landscape material provided shall be appropriate for the planting area and the overall site. 
d.  Maintain the existing on-site drainage and retention and strive to meet the minimum requirements of the St. Johns River Water Management District. 
Any further expansion or enlargement thereof shall be in accordance with all applicable code requirements. 
(2)  Existing characteristics of use which become nonconforming or increase in nonconformity as a result of a taking, including but not limited to, minimum lot size, setbacks, open space, off-street parking, landscape requirements, drainage and retention shall be required to meet code requirements to the greatest extent possible, to the satisfaction of the Administrative Official or designee. Thereafter, the existing characteristics of use shall be deemed conforming only to the extent of those nonconformities caused by the governmental or public agency's acquisition. Waivers, exceptions or variances shall not exceed a 30 percent reduction of the required parking standard, 50 percent reduction in the required front yard, elimination of the street front landscape strips, or reduction in drainage and retention that does not meet the minimum requirements of the St. Johns River Water Management District. Any further expansion or enlargement thereof shall be in accordance with all applicable code requirements. 
(3)  In granting any waiver or exception to code requirements, the Administrative Official or designee shall, in conjunction with the appropriate experts, determine that the requested waiver or exception: 
a.  Will not adversely affect visual, safety, aesthetic or environmental concerns of neighborhood properties. 
b.  Will not adversely affect the safety or pedestrians or operations of motor vehicles. 
c.  Will preserve code-required off-street parking requirements to the greatest extent practicable. The reconfiguration, reduction, or removal of landscape and/or open space requirement may be considered to preserve off-street parking. 
(4)  If any legally existing structures (principal or accessory), or vehicular use area must be relocated as a direct result of the governmental taking, or as a result of safety concerns, if allowed to remain after the taking, then the Administrative Official, or designee, the Building Official and Fire Marshal may allow the relocation of the structure on the remaining property, so as to comply with all applicable regulations to the greatest extent practicable, as determined by the Administrative Official or designee. If the relocation results in substandard characteristics of use, it shall be deemed thereafter to be conforming but only to the extent of those non-conformities caused by the governmental or public agency's acquisition. Any future expansion or enlargement thereof shall be in accordance with all applicable code requirements. 
(5)  Legally existing structures (principal or accessory) or vehicular use areas which become nonconforming or increase in nonconformity according to subsection (1), which are thereafter damaged or destroyed, other than by voluntary demolition, to an extent of more than 50 percent of the property appraiser's assessed valuation at the time of destruction can be restored, but only to predestruction condition in accordance with the Florida Fire Prevention and Florida Building Code. Any expansion or enlargement that does not increase the nonconformity of a characteristic of use shall be permitted in accordance with all applicable code requirements. Where expansion or enlargement increases the nonconformity of a characteristic of use, relief from appropriate City board(s) is necessary. This Subsection does not apply to signs, which are addressed in Subparagraph (F). 
(6)  If the structure to be relocated harbors a nonconforming use, the Administrative Official may permit the relocation pursuant to this section, if the Administrative Official or designee determines that public harm will not result. 
(7)  Where part of a principal structure is taken, the reconstruction of the taken structure (same size and use) may be permitted. The reconstruction must meet city codes to the greatest extent possible, to the satisfaction of the Administrative Official or designee. The reconstructed structure must meet the requirements of the Florida Building Code and Florida Fire Prevention Code as determined by the Building Official and Fire Marshal. The reconstructed structure shall thereafter be deemed conforming as to those nonconformities caused by the governmental or public agency's acquisition. 
(8)  Any alterations, repairs or rehabilitation work necessitated by a governmental or public agency acquisition or condemnation of real property may be made to any existing structure, building, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing system provided that the alteration, repair or rehabilitation work conforms to the requirements of the Florida Building Code and Florida Fire Prevention Code. The Building Official and Fire Marshal shall determine the extent to which the existing system shall be made to conform to the requirements of the technical codes for new construction. 
(F)  Signs. A sign which is located on a parcel that is subject to condemnation action by a governmental or public agency may be allowed to be relocated on the remaining portion of the parcel in accordance with the following: 
(1)  Conforming signs. 
a.  The sign is to be relocated on the remaining parcel in such a manner as to meet the setback and distance separation requirements. If setback and distance separation requirements cannot be met due to the size and/or configuration of the remaining parcel, then, subject to the Administrative Official's discretion, the sign may be relocated so as to comply with such regulations to the greatest extent practicable as determined by the Administrative Official. Regardless of the sign location, all sight visibility requirements shall be met. 
(2)  Nonconforming signs, including billboards. 
a.  Any existing nonconformity of a sign, other than setback or distance separation, shall not be increased upon relocation. A nonconforming sign may not be structurally altered or enhanced upon relocation. 
b.  If the sign to be relocated is a nonconforming sign, upon proof submitted by the applicant and subject to the determination by the Planning and Zoning Commission that public harm would not occur, then such sign may be relocated pursuant to this subsection, notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection 3-16.9(b) of the City sign ordinance. 
(G)  Authority for staff to testify at judicial proceedings on the likelihood of variances. 
(1)  The Administrative Official, or his designee, is hereby authorized to testify in judicial proceedings as to the likelihood of whether a variance from City codes or regulations would or would not be granted or the reasons the Administrative Official has or has not granted the waiver or exception. 
(2)  In testifying, the Administrative Official or his designee is specifically authorized to employ the following criteria: 
a.  History of similar variances, waivers or exceptions being granted or denied by the appropriate boards in and for the City of Casselberry. 
b.  Analysis of why the variance, waiver or exception would or would not adversely affect surrounding property owners. 
c.  Analysis of the hardship imposed by the condemnation action initiated by the governmental or public agency. 
d.  Analysis of any and all other criteria normally considered by the appropriate boards or departments in granting or denying similar variances, waivers or exceptions and how those criteria relate to the subject and neighboring properties. 
e.  That the granting of a variance, waiver or exception would or would not adversely affect the public health, safety or welfare. 
(H)  Code violations threatening public health, safety and welfare. 
(1)  The provisions of this section shall not be interpreted to allow for the continued existence of building or other safety code violations that are determined to be an immediate threat to the public health, safety or welfare. 
(2)  The appropriate building, fire, code enforcement officials and inspectors are hereby authorized to take any and all necessary steps to enforce all applicable development, land use, building and safety codes even though the subject property is part of a condemnation action or other government acquisition of property. 
(I)  Administrative Official's determination. Many of the determinations made by the Administrative Official, or designee, are subjective in nature; however, those determinations are provided based on the community's history and goals and by utilizing best practice methods. Those determinations are provided in the best interest of the community and the Administrative Official incurs no personal liability as a result of discharging his/her duties in making said determinations. 
(J)  The granting of a variance, waiver or exception under this Ordinance shall not be considered a non-monetary benefit to the property owner. 
(K)  Nothing herein shall cause the City to be liable for damages, expenses or losses for any action taken by the City pursuant to this Ordinance. 
(L)  The provisions of this Ordinance shall not be interpreted to grant or allow a vested right in any particular building, development or property that is subject to or affected by the governmental or public agency's acquisition.

iii.  The City shall grant or deny each properly completed application for any other communication tower or antenna based on the application's compliance with this section and any other applicable law, including but not limited to the City Code, and within the normal timeframe for a similar type of review, but in no case later than 90 business days after the date the application is determined to be properly completed. This timeframe shall not apply to lease negotiations for wireless communications facilities on City-owned property. 
iv.  An application is deemed submitted or resubmitted on the date the application is received by the City. If the City does not notify the applicant in writing that the application is not completed in compliance with the City's regulations within 20 business days after the date the application is initially submitted or additional information resubmitted, the application is deemed, for administrative purposes only, to be properly completed and properly submitted. However, the determination shall not be deemed as an approval of the application. If the application is not completed in compliance with the City's regulations, the City shall so notify the applicant in writing indicating with specificity any deficiencies in the required documents or deficiencies in the content of the required documents which, if cured, would make the application properly completed. Upon resubmission of information to cure the stated deficiencies, the City shall notify the applicant, in writing, within the normal timeframes of review, but in no case longer than 20 business days after the additional information is submitted, of any remaining deficiencies that must be cured. However, if applicant does not cure the application deficiencies within 20 business days after receiving the notice of deficiencies, the application shall be considered withdrawn or closed unless an extension, due to reasonable circumstances, of the time to cure is requested by the applicant prior to the expiration of the 20-day period, and such extension is granted by the City Manager or designee.

ii.  Permit processing timeframes: "shot clock". The City's action on proposals to place or maintain communications facilities shall be subject to the applicable standards and time frames set out in F.S. § 365.172, 47 U.S.C. § 1455 (a) and Orders issued by the FCC, as may be amended from time to time. All Federal and State "shot clock" timeframe guidelines that apply to any particular permit are hereby recognized by the City, and the City will make all reasonable efforts to comply. The following procedures apply to construction or installation of a new wireless communication facility or modification thereto: 
(a)  Notification of completeness. The City Manager or designee shall notify the applicant within 20 business days after the date the application is submitted as to whether the application is, for administrative purposes only, properly completed and has been properly submitted in accordance with the requirements set forth above. However, such determination shall not be deemed as an approval of the application. Such notification shall indicate with specificity any deficiencies which, if cured, could make the application properly completed. 
(b)  The City shall grant or deny each properly completed application for a collocation based on the application's compliance with this section, applicable provisions of the City Code and any other applicable regulations, and within the normal timeframe for a similar building permit review, but in no case later than 45 business days after the date the application is determined to be properly completed. This timeframe shall not apply to lease negotiations for collocation on City-owned property. Eligible facilities shall be subject to the requirements set forth in subsection (E). 
(c)  The City shall grant or deny each properly completed application for any other wireless communications facility based on the application's compliance with this section and any other applicable law, including but not limited to the City Code, and within the normal timeframe for a similar type of review, but in no case later than 90 business days after the date the application is determined to be properly completed. This timeframe shall not apply to lease negotiations for wireless communications facilities on City-owned property. 
(d)  An application is deemed submitted or resubmitted on the date the application is received by the City. If the City does not notify the applicant in writing that the application is not completed in compliance with the City's regulations within 20 business days after the date the application is initially submitted or additional information resubmitted, the application is deemed, for administrative purposes only, to be properly completed and properly submitted. However, the determination shall not be deemed as an approval of the application. If the application is not completed in compliance with the City's regulations, the City shall so notify the applicant in writing indicating with specificity any deficiencies in the required documents or deficiencies in the content of the required documents which, if cured, would make the application properly completed. Upon resubmission of information to cure the stated deficiencies, the City shall notify the applicant, in writing, within the normal timeframes of review, but in no case longer than 20 business days after the additional information is submitted, of any remaining deficiencies that must be cured. However, if applicant does not cure the application deficiencies within 20 business days after receiving the notice of deficiencies, the application shall be considered withdrawn or closed unless an extension due to reasonable circumstances of the time to cure is requested by the applicant prior to the expiration of the 20-day period and such extension is granted by the City Manager or designee. 
(e)  ..... The timeframes specified above may be extended only to the extent that the application has not been granted or denied, because the City's procedures generally applicable to all other similar types of applications require action by the City Commission or Planning and Zoning Commission, and such action has not taken place within the specified timeframes. Under such circumstances, the City Commission or Planning and Zoning Commission, as applicable, shall either grant or deny the application at its next regularly scheduled meeting, or, otherwise, the application shall be deemed automatically approved; accordingly, the City Manager or designee may by letter to the applicant extend the timeframe for a decision until the next available scheduled meeting date of the City Commission or Planning and Zoning Commission. To be effective, a waiver of the timeframes set forth herein must be voluntarily agreed to by the applicant and the City. The City may request, but not require, a waiver of the timeframes by the applicant, except that, with respect to a specific application, the City may require a one-time waiver in the case of a declared local, state, or federal emergency that directly affects the administration of all permitting activities of the City. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City and an applicant may voluntarily agree to waive the timeframes set forth above.

(b)  Improves transmission impacted by surrounding buildings or topography, if there is adequate tree canopy to mitigate for the increase in height. 
ii.  To decrease the separation distance requirement between wireless communication facilities required in Section 2-7.36(D)(2) by up to ten percent, the applicant must show: 
(a)  An existing utility pole is being replaced; or 
(b)  Impediments such as a dense tree canopy or tall structure interfere with signal transmission. 
iii.  To reduce the installation and stealth requirements in Section 2-7.36(D)(4)(b), the placement requirements in Section 2-7.36(D)(4)(c), or the setback and landscape buffer requirements in Section 2-7.36(D)(4)(d), the applicant must show the intent of this Section is better served by such waiver. 
E.  Eligible Facilities Request. 
1.  Applicability and Intent. This section implements Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 ("Spectrum Act") as interpreted by the Federal Communications Commission's ("FCC") Acceleration of Broadband Deployment Report & Order dated October 21, 2014, which requires local governments to approve any eligible facilities request for modification of an existing tower or base station that does not result in a substantial change to the physical dimensions of such tower or base station. This section shall apply only to eligible facilities requests for an eligible support structure that is a legal conforming or legal nonconforming structure at the time a completed eligible facilities request is submitted to the City. To the extent that the nonconforming structures and use provisions of the City ULDRs would operate to prohibit or condition approval of an eligible facilities request otherwise allowed under this section, such provisions are superseded by this section. This subsection shall not apply to an eligible facilities request replacement of the existing tower or base station. This subsection shall also not apply where the wireless communications facility requested to be modified is located upon a City-owned structure, or upon non-right-of-way property which is either City-owned or City-leased. 
2.  Sole and Exclusive Procedure. Except as may otherwise be provided in this section, and notwithstanding any other provisions in the City Code, the provisions of this section shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for review and approval of an eligible facilities request which the applicant asserts is subject to review under the Spectrum Act. To the extent that other provisions of the City Code establish a parallel process for review and approval of a project application for a proposed eligible facilities request, the provisions of this section shall control. In the event that an application for a project approval incudes a proposal to modify an eligible support structure, and the applicant does not assert in the application that the proposal is subject to review under Section 6409 of the Spectrum Act, such proposal shall not be entitled to review under this section and may be subject to review under other applicable provisions of the City Code. 
3.  Application Requirements. No eligible facilities request shall be deemed complete unless it is in writing, accompanied by the application fee. includes the required submittals, and is attested to by the authorized person submitting the application on behalf of the applicant. The application shall be submitted on a form prepared by the City. The applicant shall be obligated to demonstrate conclusively that the proposed modification satisfies the standards set forth herein and that the modification shall meet all applicable building codes. 
4.  Review of Application. The City shall review an eligible facilities request application to determine if the proposed modification is subject to this section, and if so, if the proposed modification will result in a substantial change to the physical dimensions of an eligible support structure. 
5.  Timeframe for Review. Within 45 calendar days of the date on which an applicant submits a request seeking approval under this subsection, the City shall approve, and may not deny, an eligible facilities request, unless it determines that the application is not covered by this section or proposes a substantial change to the physical dimensions of the eligible support structure. 
6.  Tolling of Timeframe for Review. The 45-day period begins to run when the application is filed with the Land Use Administrator or designee in person during the City's regular business hours, and may be tolled only by mutual agreement, or in cases where the City determines that the application is incomplete. 
a.  To toll the time frame for incompleteness, the City must provide written notice to the applicant within 30 calendar days of receipt of the application, clearly and specifically delineating all missing documents or information. 
b.  The time frame for review begins running again when the applicant makes a supplemental submission in response to the City's notice of incompleteness. 
c.  Following a supplemental submission, the City shall have ten calendar days to notify the applicant that the supplemental submission did not provide the information identified in the original notice delineating missing information. The time frame is tolled in the case of second or subsequent notices pursuant to the same procedure used for the first notice of incompleteness. Except as may be otherwise agreed to by the applicant and the City, second or subsequent notices of incompleteness may not specify missing documents or information that were not delineated in the original notice of incompleteness. 
d.  Notices of incompleteness from the City shall be deemed received by the applicant upon the earlier of personal service upon the applicant three days from deposit of the notice in the U.S. Mail, postage prepaid, to the applicant, or by electronic mail if the applicant has agreed to receive notices in such a manner. 
e.  If after submittal of the application the applicant modifies the eligible facilities request, the modified application shall be considered a new application subject to commencement of a new application review period. 
7.  Approval or Denial. An eligible facilities request shall be approved, and an eligible facilities permit issued, upon determination by the City that the proposed modification is subject to this section and that it does not substantially change the physical dimensions of an eligible support structure. An eligible facilities request shall be denied upon determination by the City that the proposed modification is not subject to this section or will substantially change the physical dimensions of an eligible support structure. 
8.  Denial. A denial of an eligible facilities request shall be in writing and shall set forth the reasons for the denial. 
9.  Remedies. Applicant and City retain any and all remedies that are available at law or in equity and any action challenging a denial of an application or notice of a deemed approved remedy, may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction within 30 days following the date of the denial or following the date of notification of the deemed approved remedy. 
10.  Applicable Code Requirements. Nothing in this section shall relieve the applicant from compliance with applicable building, structural, electrical, and safety codes and with other laws codifying objective standards reasonably related to health and safety. Any approved eligible facilities request may be conditioned upon compliance with such codes and other laws. 
11.  Expiration of Approval. An approved eligible facilities request shall be valid for a term of 180 days from the date of approval or the date the application is deemed approved. 
12.  Not Covered as an Eligible Facilities Request. Should the City determine that an applicant's request is not covered by Section 6409(a) of the Spectrum Act, the presumptively reasonable time frame under 47 U.S.C. § 332 (c)(7), as prescribed by the FCC's Shot Clock order, will begin to run from the issuance of the City's decision that the application is not a covered request. To the extent such information is necessary, the City may request additional information from the applicant to evaluate the application under 47 U.S.C. § 332 (c)(7), pursuant to the limitations applicable to other reviews under that statute. 
13.  Failure to Act. In the event the City fails to approve or deny a request under this section within the timeframe for review, accounting for any tolling, the request shall be deemed granted. The application deemed granted does not become effective until the applicant notifies the City in writing after the review period has expired, accounting for any tolling, that the application has been deemed granted. 
F.  Abandonment. In the event the use of any communication tower or wireless communication facility has been discontinued for a period of 180 consecutive days, the tower or facility shall be deemed to be abandoned. Except for those facilities located within public rights-of-way, determination of the date of abandonment shall be made by the Administrative Official who shall have the right to request documentation or affidavits from the communication tower owner/operator regarding the issue of tower usage. Upon such abandonment, the owner/operator of the tower shall have an additional 180 days within which to: (i) reactivate the use of the tower or transfer the tower to another owner/operator who makes actual use of the tower, or (ii) dismantle and remove the tower. Except as provided herein, the abandonment of communication towers and wireless communication facilities within public rights-of-way shall be managed in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 68-172, City Code of Ordinances.

ARTICLE VIII. - NONCONFORMING USES AND NONCOMPLIANT STRUCTURES[7] 

Footnotes: 
--- (7) --- 
Cross reference- Nonconforming signs, § 3-16.9. 

Section 2-8.1. - Purpose and intent. 
    This Article is intended to permit the continuation of those lots, structures, uses, characteristics of use, or combinations thereof, which were lawful before the passage of this Code, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this Code or future amendments thereto. This Article is designed to provide standards and guidelines for the control and management of nonconforming uses and noncomplying buildings and structures, especially in regulating changes in the use of land or in the buildings or structures, including quality, volume or intensity, location, ownership or tenancy, accessory or incidental uses, extension, enlargement, replacement, or any other change in characteristic. 
    It is the intent of this Article to permit these nonconformities and non-compliances to continue until they are removed but not to encourage their survival. Such uses are declared by this Chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved. It is further the intent of this Article that nonconformities and non-compliances shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same district. 
(Ord. No. 10-1332, § 2, 6-28-10; Ord. No. 18-1482, § 2, 6-11-18) 
Section 2-8.2. - Definitions. 
    For purposes of this Code the terms "nonconforming use" and "noncomplying building or structure" are defined as follows: 
1.  Nonconforming use. A use of a building or structure or a tract of land which does not, on the effective date of this ordinance or amendment thereto, conform to any one of the current permitted uses or the district in which it is located. Herein such nonconforming use may be referred to as a "nonconformity." 
2.  Noncomplying building or structure. Any building or other structure which is a lawful use (permitted or nonconforming) but which does not comply with all applicable provisions of this Code, including size and dimension regulations, offstreet parking requirements, landscape requirements, nuisance abatement standards, or height requirements either on the effective date of this ordinance or as a result of any subsequent amendment. Herein such noncomplying building or structure may be referred to as a "noncompliance." 
Section 2-8.3. - Continuance of lawful non- conformities and/or noncompliances. 
A.  Continuance of nonconformance. A nonconforming use lawfully existing at the time of the enactment of this ordinance may be continued subject to the provisions of this Code. 
B.  Continuance of noncompliance. The lawful use of a noncomplying building or structure may be continued subject to provisions of this Code. 
C.  Rules for interpretation. Nothing in this Code shall be interpreted as authorization for or approval of the continuation of any illegal use of a building, structure, or land that was in violation of any ordinance in effect at the time of the passage of this ordinance. The casual, intermittent, temporary, or illegal use of land, building or structure shall not be a basis to establish the existence of a nonconforming use. A lawful building permit issued for any building or structure prior to the enactment of this ordinance, the construction of which is in conformity with approved site plans, if applicable, and building plans shall not be affected by this ordinance if the building or structure is built in full compliance with this Code as it existed at the time of the issuance of the building permit. However, if such building or structure does not conform to the provisions of this Code which cause such planned building, structure or use to be nonconforming or noncomplying, then it shall be nonconforming or noncomplying, or both, as the case may be, by applying this ordinance to the building, structure or use. 
Section 2-8.4. - Noncomplying lots or building sites of record. 
    In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Code, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot or building site of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of these land development regulations. Such lot or building site must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other building sites under the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot or building site fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and other requirements not involving area or width, or both, of the lot or building site shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot or building site is located. Variance of area, width and yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the Planning and Zoning Commission. 
    If two or more building sites or combinations of building sites and portions of building sites with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this Article and if all or part of the building sites do not meet the requirements for building site width and area as established by this Article, the land involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this Article, and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold which does not meet building site width and area requirements established by the land development regulations, nor shall any division of the parcel be made which leaves remaining any building site with width or area below the requirements stated in the land development regulations. 
(Ord. No. 12-1369, § 9, 2-13-12) 
Section 2-8.5. - Increase in nonconformities prohibited. 
    A nonconforming use shall not be extended, expanded, enlarged, or increased in intensity. Such prohibitions shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following: 
1.  Extension of a nonconforming use to any other building or other structure or the extension of a nonconforming use to any land area other than the specific land area that was actually and directly occupied by such use on the effective date of this ordinance (or on the effective date of a subsequent amendment thereto that causes such use to become nonconforming). 
2.  Extension of a nonconforming use within a building or other structure to any portion of floor area on the same or another floor that was not actually and directly occupied by such use on the effective date of this ordinance (or on the effective date of a subsequent amendment thereto that causes such use to become nonconforming). 
3.  Operation of a nonconforming use in such manner as to conflict with any performance standards established for the district in which the use is located. 
4.  The addition of signs attached to a nonconforming building or structure intended to be seen from off the premises. 
5.  Additions which increase the area of a building or structure if the building or structure is occupied, in whole or in part, by a nonconforming use. 
6.  Structural alterations to any building or structure occupied by a nonconforming use except as permitted by this Section. 
    Pursuant to the powers and procedures cited in Section 1-2.7, the Planning and Zoning Commission may grant a variance which authorizes the reconstruction of a nonconforming use which is destroyed by fire or storm damage. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall manage unanticipated future redevelopment activities necessitated by fire or other natural disasters with careful consideration of growth management and the local economy, and shall consider the recommendations of the Administrative Official. Therefore, if, in the future, structures within the City receive storm damage or fire damage in excess of 50 percent of their appraised value, all such damaged structures shall be required to meet all current laws and ordinances, including those enacted since construction of the subject structure. However, in evaluating petitions for a variance to this standard, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall balance the need to protect life and property with the equally compelling need to preserve and sustain the economic base of the community. Any such replacement, restoration, or reconstruction which may subsequently be authorized by the Planning and Zoning Commission may only occur in compliance with those building, plumbing, electrical, gas, fire, and other construction and safety related regulations of the City of Casselberry in effect at the time of application for a permit to allow replacement, restoration or reconstruction. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall ensure that reasonable effort is undertaken to remedy any prior nonconformity. However, in no event shall the destroyed nonconforming structure be replaced to a degree or level which increases the prior existing nonconformance. Prior to granting any City permits for reconstruction, the applicant shall provide any and all applicable state or federal permits authorizing such reconstruction. 
    Nothing contained in this Article shall in any way prohibit a nonconforming use from acquiring additional offstreet parking area, subject to applicable landscape requirements. 
(Ord. No. 12-1369, § 10, 2-13-12) 
Section 2-8.6. - Effect of actual construction. 
    To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Article shall be deemed to require a change in plans, construction or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of the land development regulations and upon which actual building construction has been diligently carried on. "Actual construction" is hereby defined to include the placing of materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner, except that, where demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed to be "actual construction," provided that work shall be diligently carried on until completion of the building involved. 
Section 2-8.7. - Repairs and maintenance to structure accommodating a nonconforming use. 
    On any building devoted in whole or in part to any nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of 12 consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding ten percent of the current replacement value of the building, provided that the cubic content of the building as it existed at the time of passage or amendment of this Chapter shall not be increased. 
    Nothing in the land development regulations shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official. 
Section 2-8.8. - Alterations to noncomplying structures. 
    Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Code, and it could not be built or used under the terms of this Code by reason of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, location on the lot, or other site development standards or requirements concerning the structure, it may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
1.  Alteration, extension, enlargement or expansion of noncomplying building or structure. No such alteration, extension, enlargement or expansion of a nonconforming use or noncomplying building or structure shall be permitted in a way which increases its noncompliance with present site development and use standards of the zoning district in which it is located, but any such structure or use or portion thereof may be altered to decrease its noncompliance with present site development standards of the zoning district in which it is located. Nothing in this Subsection shall prohibit the City from ordering compliance with all other provisions of this Code and applicable building construction and safety related codes. 
2.  Replacement, restoration and reconstruction of non-complying building or structure. In the event that any lawful existing non-complying structure, as provided for in this Article, is destroyed by any means, such structure or use may be authorized upon receiving a variance from the Planning and Zoning Commission. In such case, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall require that any replacement, restoration, and reconstruction occur only in compliance with those building, plumbing, electrical, gas, fire, and other construction and safety related regulations of the City of Casselberry in effect at the time of application for a permit to allow replacement, restoration or reconstruction. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall require remedy of any prior noncompliance where the Planning and Zoning Commission finds the same to be reasonable. However, in no event shall the destroyed non-complying structure be replaced to a degree or level which increases the prior existing noncompliance. Prior to granting any City permit for reconstruction, the applicant shall provide any and all applicable state and federal permits authorizing such reconstruction. 
3.  Repairs and maintenance of noncomplying building or structure. Routine repairs and maintenance of noncomplying structures or uses on fixtures, wiring or plumbing, or on the repair or replacement of walls shall be permitted. 
4.  Change in location of noncomplying building or structure. Should any noncomplying structure be moved for any reason to any distance whatever from its original permitted location, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located after it is moved. 
5.  Treatment of offstreet parking and landscape requirements. All changes in nonconformities or noncompliances shall satisfy the appropriate parking and landscape provisions cited below. Any required offstreet parking and/or landscape improvements shall be managed through the offstreet parking and landscape regulations of this Code. 
a.  If only parking is deficient at the time of the proposed change and the change does not require any additional parking space which would increase the then-existing parking deficiency, the change is permitted, provided the then-existing parking deficiency and its attendant landscaping are corrected to the extent sufficient land was available on the site on the effective date of this ordinance to accommodate some or all of the deficient offstreet parking or to the extent land is available onsite at the time of the proposed change of use, whichever land area is greater. 
b.  If only landscaping is deficient at the time of the proposed change and the change does not require additional parking space, the change is permitted, providing the then existing landscaping deficiency is corrected to the extent sufficient land was available on the site on the effective date of this ordinance to accommodate some or all of the then-deficient landscaping or to the extent land is available onsite at the time of the proposed change of use, whichever land area is greater. 
c.  If the parking area is deficient at the time of the proposed change and the proposed change requires any additional parking space over the then-existing parking deficiency, the change is prohibited unless the net additional parking area and its attendant landscaping are provided and any prior existing deficiencies are corrected under the same criteria of Subsection 2-8.8(5)(a) above. 
d.  If both parking and landscaping are deficient at the time of the proposed change and the change does not require any additional parking or any additional landscaping which would increase the need for parking or landscaping over the then-existing deficiencies, the change is permitted provided the deficiencies are corrected to the extent sufficient land was available on the site on the effective date of this ordinance to accommodate some or all of the then-deficient parking or landscaping, or to the extent land is available on the site at the time of the proposed change, whichever land area is greater. 
If sufficient land was not available on the site on the effective date of this ordinance to allow correction of all of the parking and landscaping deficiencies and sufficient land is not then (at the time of the proposed change) available, priority for correcting the landscaping and parking deficiencies shall be determined on a case-by-case basis by the Administrative Official, and the City Engineer if the change is a minor change in site plan, or by the Planning and Zoning Commission if the change requires full site plan review. 
e.  If parking and landscaping are in compliance at the time of the proposed change and the proposed change does not render either the parking or landscaping deficient, the change is permitted. If the proposed change would render either the parking or landscaping, or both, to become deficient, and therefore noncomplying, the change is prohibited unless the required additional parking and landscaping are provided. 
(Ord. No. 12-1369, § 11, 2-13-12) 
Section 2-8.9. - Abandonment or discontinuance of a nonconforming use. 
    If a nonconforming use is removed or abandoned, or ceases for a continuous period of more than 90 consecutive days, any and every future use of the premises shall be in conformity with the use provisions of the land development regulations. All material and equipment associated with the abandoned or discontinued nonconforming use shall be completely removed from the premises by its owner within six months after the expiration of the 90-day period. No additional structure which does not conform to the requirements of this Article shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land. 
Chapter III - PERFORMANCE CRITERIA 
ARTICLE IX. - CONCURRENCY MANAGEMENT 

Section 3-9.1. - Purpose and intent. 
    Concurrency is a finding that the public facilities and services necessary to support a proposed development are available, or will be made available, concurrent with the impacts of the development. This Article is intended to provide a systematic process for the review and evaluation of all proposed development for its impact on concurrency facilities and services, as required by the Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act, F.S. ch. 163, pt. II, and Rule 9J-5.0055, Florida Administrative Code. 
    Facilities in Casselberry that are subject to these regulations include: 
  Potable water. 
  Sanitary sewer. 
  Drainage. 
  Recreation and open space. 
  Solid waste. 
  Traffic circulation. 
    The purpose of this Article is to ensure that development orders and permits are conditioned on the availability of concurrency facilities and services which meet adopted level of service requirements identified in this Article. This Article is also intended to describe the requirements and procedures for determining consistency of proposed development with the City of Casselberry's Comprehensive Plan. 
Section 3-9.2. - Consistency with City's Comprehensive Plan. 
    All development applications shall demonstrate compliance with the City of Casselberry Comprehensive Plan as well as with all applicable provisions of the City land development regulations and the Comprehensive Plan. Further, development applications shall demonstrate that specified concurrency facilities shall be available at prescribed levels of service concurrent with the impact of the development of those facilities. 
Section 3-9.3. - Definition of concurrency management terms. 
    The following definitions shall apply to concurrency management rules and regulations: 
    Appeal: A request for a review of an administrative interpretation of any provision of this Article, or a review of a decision made by any administrative official or board or commission. 
    Building permit: For purposes of the concurrency management ordinance, a permit which authorizes the construction of a new building, or the expansion of floor area, or the increase in the number of dwelling units contained in an existing building, or change in use shall qualify as a building permit. 
    Capacity: Refers to the availability of a public service or facility to accommodate users, expressed in an appropriate unit of measure, such as gallons per day or average daily trips. 
    Capacity, available: Capacity which can be reserved or committed to future users for a specific public facility or service. 
    Capacity, committed: The amount of capacity which has been committed to accommodate existing developments, developments which have been issued certificates of concurrency, and vested developments. 
    Capacity reservation certificate: A certificate issued by the City pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Article which constitutes proof that adequate capacity for each concurrency facility has been reserved to serve the densities and intensities of development within the timeframe designated on the certificate. 
    Capacity, reserved: Capacity which has been removed from the available capacity pool and allocated to a particular property for a set period of time. 
    Capacity, vested: Capacity which has been withdrawn from the available capacity pool through issuance of a vesting determination. 
    Certificate of concurrency: A valid statement issued by the City relating to a specific development project on a specific parcel of real property or part thereof, which states that all predevelopment concurrency requirements are satisfied and that a specified quantity of concurrency facilities are reserved for a specified period of time. The issuance of a certificate of concurrency shall be a prerequisite to the issuance of any final development order. 
    Certificate of occupancy: A document issued by the proper authority allowing the occupancy or use of a building and certifying that the structure or use has been constructed or will be used in compliance with all the applicable municipal codes and ordinances. 
    Concurrency credit memorandum: A concurrency credit memorandum documents the unused concurrency facility capacity to which an applicant for redevelopment is entitled (ref. Section 3.9.4(C)). 
    Concurrency facilities: Public facilities and services for which a level of service must be met concurrent with the impacts of development or an acceptable deadline, as mandated in the Comprehensive Plan pursuant to F.S. ch. 163 and 9J-5.0055, Florida Administrative Code, shall include: 
  Potable water. 
  Sanitary sewer. 
  Drainage. 
  Recreation and open space. 
  Solid waste. 
  Traffic circulation. 
    Concurrency management monitoring system: The data collection, processing and analysis performed by the City to determine available capacity for concurrency facilities. Data utilized shall be the most current reliable information available to the City. 
    Concurrency management system: The procedure and process that the City uses to ensure that no development order or permit is issued by the City unless the necessary concurrency facilities are available or are assured to be available consistent with the City of Casselberry Comprehensive Plan. The procedure and process is also intended to ensure that sufficient capacity for concurrency facilities is available to meet and maintain adopted levels of service. As part of the concurrency management system the City shall operate and maintain a concurrency management monitoring system. 
    Concurrency review: Evaluation by the City Administrative Official based on adopted level of service standards to ensure that public facilities and services needed to support development are available concurrent with the impacts of such development as defined in this Article. 
    Concurrency status report: A documented status report prepared by the City identifying available concurrency facility capacity. The status report shall be produced, modified and adjusted from time to time as a result of the reservation of capacity or other act which alters the availability of concurrency facility capacity. 
    Design capacity: The potential or suitability for holding, storing or accommodating the demands upon a concurrency facility. 
    Developer's agreement: An agreement entered into between the City and another party associated with the development of land, including agreements associated with development orders issued pursuant to F.S. § 380.01. 
    Development order: Any order or permit granting, denying or granting with conditions an application for a preliminary development order, a final development order, a development permit or any other official action of the City having the effect of permitting the development of land. 
    Development order, final: This shall mean the last discretionary act of the City before development can commence. The last discretionary act shall occur through an act of official authorization and with recorded documentation from the City of Casselberry thereby approving the final development plans for a proposed development project. The issuance of a final development order after the effective date of the ordinance adopting the Comprehensive Plan shall only occur if the final development plan complies with the goals, objectives, and policies established in the Comprehensive Plan. 
    Final development orders shall include the City's final approval of the following development procedures: 
  Final subdivision plat approved subsequent to the adoption of the Comprehensive Plan; 
  Building permit; 
  Preliminary plat; 
  Site plan approval; 
  Planned unit development (PUD) final development plan; and 
  Developments of regional impact (DRI) approval. 
    Development order, non-impact: For the purposes of concurrency management, development orders such as approvals or permits for dredge and fill operations, driveway construction, signs, electrical or plumbing improvements, tree removal, and similar activities having no impact on concurrency facilities shall be exempt from the concurrency management review process. 
    Development order, preliminary: The following development orders are deemed to be preliminary development orders. Applicants for such permits shall not be eligible to receive a "certificate of concurrency" until such time as an application for a final development order is submitted. 
  Comprehensive Plan amendment. 
  Rezoning. 
  Conditional use. 
  Variance. 
    Letter of capacity reservation: A letter of capacity reservation confirms the conditions under which an applicant receives an allocation of concurrency capacity. The letter is provided subsequent to the applicant's payment of the concurrency reservation fee (ref. Section 3-9.7(B)). 
    Level of service: An indicator of the operational efficiency of service provided by a concurrency facility. 
    Level of service standard: The adopted volume of demand required for each concurrency facility in order to achieve acceptable operational efficiency. 
    Pool, available capacity: The total unused capacity of concurrency facilities existing at any point in time. 
    Proceeding in good faith: Tangible and continuing actions taken by an applicant of an approved final development order to perform actual project construction and implementation leading to completion of a final development plan within a reasonable period of time. Moreover, a certificate of completion for the development of infrastructure must be received within three years of the date from which the construction was authorized in order to satisfy the definition of the said term. 
    Reservation period: The length of time for which capacity may be reserved. 
    Vested rights: A development order shall be deemed "vested" and not subject to the requirements of concurrency management if development circumstances meet criteria for common law or statutory vesting, as defined below. All "nonvested" development or development orders are subject to all requirements of this Article. 
    Vested rights, common law: A right not created by statute or the provisions of the City of Casselberry Comprehensive Plan which would authorize the development of real property or the continued development of real property notwithstanding the provisions of the City of Casselberry Comprehensive Plan. Such vesting may be found to exist whenever the applicant proves by a preponderance of evidence that the real property owner, acting in good faith upon some act or omission of the City, has made a substantial change in the position or has incurred such extensive obligations and expenses that it would be highly inequitable and unjust to destroy the right to develop or to continue the development of the real property. The assignment of the particular zoning classification or the assignment of a particular land use designation to parcel of real property does not guarantee or vest any specific development rights to any person or entity as to said real property. 
    Vested rights, statutory: A statutory right to develop or to continue the development of real property pursuant to the provisions of F.S. § 163.3187(8), or its successor provisions. Such vesting may be found to exist if a valid and unexpired final development order was issued by the City prior to the effective date of the City's 1992 Comprehensive Plan, if the development has commenced construction and the development is in the process of being completed or further development is continuing in good faith as of and subsequent to effective date of the City's 1992 Comprehensive Plan. Statutory vesting does not occur unless all material requirements, conditions, limitations and regulations of the development order have been met and are being maintained. The Unified Land Development Regulations shall not apply to developments which have commenced duly approved construction prior to the effective date of the City's Comprehensive Plan. 
Section 3-9.4. - Applicability and exemptions. 
    All applications for final development orders shall be subject to concurrency review unless specifically exempted below. However, in no case shall a development order be issued for a minimum threshold project which would impact a concurrency facility for which a moratorium or deferral on development has been placed. 
A.  Projects below the minimum threshold. The following development shall be exempt from concurrency review: 
1.  Residential projects which would result in the creation of one single-family dwelling or one two-family dwelling-as well as projects that entail structural alterations, including room additions to single-family structures-which do not change the land use. 
2.  Change of use or expansion of nonresidential projects of up to ten percent of the existing gross floor area, providing such change of use or expansion is estimated to generate less than 120 vehicle trips per day and create no more than one equivalent residential unit of utility demand. Trip generation data shall be pursuant to the latest edition of the publication entitled: Trip Generation, Institute of Traffic Engineers. 
3.  Construction of residential or nonresidential accessory buildings and structures which do not create additional public facility demand. 
4.  Actions administered through non-impact development orders as well as other developments which do not increase demand on concurrency facilities, such as grading or excavation of land or structural alterations which do not include a change of use and satisfy provisions of 1. and 2. above. 
B.  Vested projects. Projects which have valid final development orders or permits prior to the effective date of the 1992 Comprehensive Plan shall be considered to be vested and therefore exempt from concurrency management. This shall include the following: 
1.  Any project for which a valid building permit has been issued and has not expired; and 
2.  All vacant lots in single-family detached, single-family attached and two-family subdivisions which were platted and recorded prior to the effective date of this Article; and 
3.  Approved developments of regional impact with a development order that has not expired; and 
4.  Any project which the City Commission may, on a case-by-case basis, approve as a "vested" project pursuant to the definition of a vested rights, common law vested rights and/or statutory vested rights as established in this Article. 
C.  Redevelopment projects. Proposed redevelopment shall be credited for 110 percent capacity of the existing project. If a redevelopment project generates demand in excess of 110 percent of the buildings or establishment it is replacing, a concurrency review shall be required; however, the concurrency review shall only be directed to the demand generated which exceeds the demand of prior existing development. 
The site plan for redevelopment must be submitted no more than one year after demolition in order to qualify for a concurrency credit memorandum. If the proposed redevelopment generates equal or less demand than the existing project, the applicant for concurrency review shall be given a concurrency credit memorandum within 30 days of the concurrency evaluation which enables the applicant to reserve the unused capacity. The concurrency credit memorandum will expire within five years of its issuance. The applicant's submission of an application for a demolition permit shall initiate the concurrency review for the express purpose of issuing credits for redevelopment. 
D.  Public facilities. Public facilities necessary to ensure the protection of the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the City of Casselberry, including public schools (pre-kindergarten through 12th grade), shall be exempt from concurrency review. This shall include all public facility construction projects included in the city's capital improvements program required to meet any adopted level of service standard. 
Section 3-9.5. - Criteria for concurrency and final development orders. 
    A final development order shall not be granted for a proposed development unless the City finds that adequate capacity for concurrency facilities exists at or above adopted level of service in order to accommodate the impacts of the proposed development, or that improvements necessary to bring concurrency facilities up to their adopted level of service will be in place concurrent with the impacts of the development. 
    The City shall find that the following criteria have been met in order for a proposed development to be found in compliance with concurrency management requirements: 
1.  The necessary concurrency facilities and services are in place at the time a development permit is issued, or a development permit is issued subject to the condition that the necessary facilities and services will be in place by a specified date when the impacts of the development are anticipated to occur; or 
2.  The necessary facilities are under construction at the time a development permit is issued; or 
3.  The necessary facilities and services are the subject of a binding executed contract for the construction of the facilities or the provision of services at the time the development permit is issued; or 
4.  The necessary facilities and services have been included in the capital improvements program and are programmed for construction prior to or concurrent with the impacts of the proposed development; or 
5.  In the case of road facilities, the necessary improvements are committed in the first three years of the applicable adopted Florida Department of Transportation five-year work program, or the Seminole County five-year transportation plan; or 
6.  The necessary facilities and services are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement. An enforceable development agreement may include, but is not limited to, development agreements pursuant to F.S. § 163.3220, or an agreement or development order issued pursuant to F.S. ch. 380, or any other development agreement entered into between the City and a development. The agreement must guarantee that the necessary facilities and services will be in place prior to or concurrent with the impacts of the development. 
Section 3-9.6. - Concurrency administration. 
    The City Administrative Official shall be responsible for concurrency reviews as required by this Article. The City Administrative Official shall determine whether adequate capacities for concurrency facilities are available to satisfy the demands of each proposed development. Refer to Table 3-9.6, Concurrency Management Flowchart, for a graphic summary of the administration process. 
A.  Application for concurrency review. Concurrency review shall be initiated upon submission and acceptance of an application for concurrency review. An applicant may request a concurrency review upon making application in an acceptable form to the City Administrative Official. At the request of the applicant and pursuant to payment of a fee established in the manner set forth in this ordinance, the City Administrative Official may render concurrency findings. 
B.  Project impact assessment. The City Administrative Official shall use the best available information to establish and evaluate existing capacities for concurrency facilities. The applicant shall be responsible for supplying the anticipated land uses, densities and/or intensities of a proposed development and the anticipated date of completion of proposed development. The City Administrative Official shall assess the anticipated impacts of the proposed development on concurrency facilities. 
C.  Project phasing/timing of improvements. Concurrency facilities associated with a phased development may also be phased. However, all concurrency facilities necessary to accommodate the impacts of each phase must be available or a schedule for the acquired improvements must be approved prior to the issuance of a final development order. The schedule of facility improvements shall ensure that all facility improvements necessary to accommodate the impacts of the development (or portion thereof) for which a certificate of completion or certificate of occupancy has been applied shall be in place prior to the issuance of the certificate. Under no circumstances shall the final certificate of occupancy or completion be issued for a project unless all required facility improvements required by the development order or development agreement have been completed. 
D.  Development agreements. If the minimum requirements for concurrency cannot be met, concurrency may be achieved by guaranteeing necessary facility improvements in an enforceable development agreement. Said development agreement may include guarantees to construct required facility improvements or to provide funds equivalent to the cost of providing such facility improvements. 
E.  Concurrency review determination. Upon the conclusion of the concurrency review, the City Administrative Official shall prepare a written determination concerning the proposed development. This determination shall address, but is not limited to: 
1.  The anticipated public facility impacts of the proposed development; 
2.  The ability of existing facilities to accommodate the proposed development at the adopted level of service standards; 
3.  Any existing facility deficiencies that will need to be corrected prior to the completion of the proposed development; 
4.  The facility improvements or additions necessary to accommodate the impact of the proposed development at the adopted level of service standards and the entities responsible for the design and installation of all required facility improvements or additions; and 
5.  The date such facility improvements or additions will need to be completed to be concurrent with the impacts on such facilities created by the proposed development. 
F.  Action required to bind concurrency review. After receiving an approved concurrency review, the applicant may pay a binder fee within ten calendar days of the date of the determination, in order to bind the available capacity required to service the proposed development. The amount and method of the fee payment shall be determined by resolution of the City Commission. Payment of the binder fee shall enable the applicant to reserve available capacity required to service the proposed development for a period not exceeding 60 calendar days. Within the 60-calendar-day period, the applicant shall be required to reserve the capacity by paying a concurrency reservation fee as described below in Section 3-9.7. The binder fee shall be credited to the capacity reservation fee. However, if no capacity is reserved within the 60-calendar-day period, the binder fee shall not be refunded. 
G.  Concurrency denials. In the event that the City's concurrency review reveals that the proposed development would generate public facility impacts beyond that which can be absorbed by available capacity, the City shall determine whether there is a financial or other legally binding commitment to ensure that public facilities necessary to correct the anticipated deficiency will be in place concurrent with the impacts of the proposed development. If the City and/or a developer are unable to provide such assurances, the project shall be denied. 
H.  Concurrency resolution. If the City Administrative Official determines that an application for concurrency review cannot be supported by sufficient concurrency facility capacity, the applicant may file an application for concurrency resolution and pay the requisite filing fee as shall be established by resolution of the City Commission. The purpose for the concurrency resolution process shall be to enable an applicant to negotiate a development agreement which identifies terms for resolving the capacity deficiency. The development agreement shall be consistent with F.S. § 163.3220 and applicable City ordinances. 
If the applicant successfully resolves capacity deficiencies, the applicant may reserve capacity pursuant to the terms of the development agreement. If the issues cannot be resolved, the application shall be deemed to be denied and, at any time, the applicant may resubmit the concurrency review application to the City Administrative Official. 
Section 3-9.7. - Capacity reservation. 
A.  Reservation of capacity. At any time during the 60-day interval following receipt of an approved concurrency determination, the applicant may pay a concurrency reservation fee in order to reserve concurrency facility capacity. The amount of the fee and the timeframe of the concurrency reservation shall be based on a fee schedule established by resolution of the City Commission. The timeframe of the concurrency reservation shall not exceed two years with a two-year renewal. The amount of the fee shall vary with the timeframe of the concurrency reservation. If the applicant fails to pay the fee required to reserve capacity, the available capacity assigned to the applicant shall be returned to the available capacity pool and the applicant will not be eligible to file for concurrency determination until 60 calendar days following the expiration of the binder fee. 
    Upon payment of a capacity reservation fee, the applicant shall receive a letter of capacity reservation from the City Administrative Official. The letter of capacity reservation does not represent overall development approval and shall not release a recipient from complying with all applicable land development regulations. No final development order shall be granted until the applicant has first purchased a concurrency reservation. 
B.  First come, first served. Letters of capacity reservation shall be issued on a first come, first served, basis by the City Administrative Official. Letters of capacity reservation shall be valid only for the specific land uses, densities, intensities, construction and improvement schedules contained in the application. Letters of capacity reservation run with the land and are transferable to a successor in ownership. Reservation of capacity for concurrency shall expire if the underlying development order or development agreement expires or is revoked. 
C.  Project deferrals/development moratoriums. If at any time the City's inventory of the capacity of concurrency facilities indicates that concurrency facilities have dropped below its adopted level of service standard, the City shall cease to issue development orders for projects which would impact the deficient facilities or the area impacted by the deficient concurrency facilities, as defined within this ordinance. Such a suspension or moratorium on the issuance of development orders shall continue until such time as the adopted level of service standard is reestablished, the Comprehensive Plan is amended to reflect an acceptable level of service standard for the facilities in question, or alternative arrangements are made to ensure capacity will be available, consistent with Section 3-9.5(1)-(6). 
D.  Certificate of concurrency. Simultaneously with the receipt of a final development order, the applicant shall receive a certificate of concurrency. The certificate of concurrency shall cite the terms of the concurrency reservation, including the allocation of available capacity, the timeframe for the allocation, and other appropriate legal assurances.

Section 3-9.9. - Methodology for determining demands on concurrency facilities. 
A.  Roadways. In determining demand for available capacity for roadways, the following criteria shall be used: 
1.  Residential development. For proposed residential development (except within planned developments), the following trip generation rates shall be used to calculate the impact of the proposed development: 
Land Use Type Trips Per Day Per Unit Single-family 10 Multiple-family  8  
2.  Nonresidential development and mixed-use planned unit development (PUD). For all other development categories allowed within the future land use element, the impacts of development shall be measured by utilizing the average peak trip generation rate associated with the land use designation in which the proposed development shall occur, using the most recent published edition of the Institute of Traffic Engineers' Trip Generation Manual. Internal capture rates may be considered in determining traffic volumes for mixed-use developments; however, the applicant shall bear the burden of demonstrating any internal capture rates of the total nonresidential trips. 
3.  Other methods and procedures. If the preliminary level of service information indicates a deficiency in capacity based on adopted level of service standards (reference Section 3-9.8 for adopted level of service standards for roadways), the developer may, at his option, prepare a more detailed alternative highway capacity analysis as described in the Highway Capacity Manual (Special Report 209, Transportation Research Board, National Research Council, 1985), or conduct a travel time and delay study following professional standards and procedures contained in the Florida Department of Transportation, Traffic Engineering Office, in its Manual for Uniform Traffic Studies. 
For all new developments which are anticipated to generate 500 or more trips per day, the developer shall be required to submit a traffic analysis which identifies the development's impact on the City's transportation system. 
The City Administrative Official may also require the submission of a traffic analysis for developments that generate less than 500 trips per day if the site location, anticipated total trip generation, circulation patterns or other such factors warrant a more extensive review of traffic impacts. 
The impact area for the traffic analysis shall include adjacent and connected roadway segments as determined by the City Administrative Official. The applicant may apply alternative trip allocations together with a statement of trip allocation methodology consistent with professional standards established in one or more of the following documents: 
  Highway Capacity Manual, Special Report 209, Transportation Research Board, National Research Council, 1985. 
  Florida Highway System Plan, "Traffic Analysis Procedures," Florida Department of Transportation, Bureau of Multi-Modal Systems Planning, 1987. 
  Florida Highway System Plan, "Level of Service Standards and Guidelines Manual," Florida Department of Transportation, 1988. 
  Trip Generation, Institute of Transportation Engineers (latest edition). 
  Transportation and Land Development, Stover, Virgil G., Institute of Transportation Engineers, 1988. 
The traffic analysis shall include the following: 
a.  Total projected average weekday trips for the proposed development. 
  Pass-by capture rate (commercial land uses only); 
  Internal capture rate (planned development only); 
  Peak external trips based on ITE Trip Generation Manual, fifth (or most recent) edition; and 
  Peak hour directional projected vehicle trips on all segments of the arterial and collector street system which are adjacent to the development project or as determined necessary by the City Administrative Official. 
b.  Design capacity of the accessed road(s). 
c.  Analysis of traffic distribution on the road network including all links impacted by more than ten percent of project traffic or 500 trips per day, whichever is greater. The trip distribution shall be consistent with the "presets" contained in the approved trip generation model. As determined by the City Administrative Official, the approved trip generation model shall be the Seminole County trip generation model, the Orlando Urban Area Transportation Study (OUATS) model, or another distribution model approved by the City. 
d.  Necessary operational improvements to the City-, county-, or state-maintained transportation system in order to maintain the adopted level of service for the roadway. 
e.  Other related information as required by the City. 
f.  Justification, including appropriate references, for the use of any trip generation rates, adjustment factors or traffic assignment methods not previously approved by the City. 
g.  The latest edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Trip Generation Manual shall be used to calculate these estimates. Adjustments to these estimates may be made, based on special trip generation information supplied by the applicant. 
If the alternative methodology, after review and acceptance by the City Administrative Official, indicates no deficiency in the capacity based on the adopted level of service standard, notwithstanding that the Comprehensive Plan indicates a deficiency in capacity based on the adopted level of service standard, the results of the alternative methodology will be used. However, the City shall, at its discretion, reserve the option to have the methodology reviewed by a professional transportation engineer or transportation planner prior to accepting the methodology. The cost for such review shall be borne by the applicant. 
B.  Other facilities. The level of service standards for all concurrency facilities are listed in Section 3-9.8. The applicant shall provide the City Administrative Official with the information required to apply the adopted level of service standard as cited below. The demand on concurrency facilities generated by the applicant's development shall be determined as cited below. 
1.  Solid waste. The demand for solid waste collection and disposal capacity shall be determined by applying the standard cited below: 
Land Use Solid Waste Residential 3.5 pounds per capita per day (i.e., multiply the total number of persons served times 3.5 pounds). Nonresidential 3.5 pounds per equivalent units of population (i.e., multiply 3.5 pounds times the total equivalent units of population served).  
2.  Potable water. For residential development, the demand for potable water shall be determined by multiplying 120 gallons times the total number of persons served proposed (i.e., 120 × total persons served). 
For nonresidential development, the demand for potable water shall be determined by multiplying 120 gallons times the total equivalent units of population served (i.e., multiply 120 × the total equivalent units of population served). 
3.  Sanitary sewer. For residential development, the demand for sanitary sewer shall be determined by multiplying 90 gallons times the total number of persons served proposed (i.e., 90 × total persons served). 
For nonresidential development, the demand for sanitary sewer shall be determined by multiplying 90 gallons times the total equivalent units of population served (i.e., multiply 90 × the total equivalent units of population served). 
4.  Drainage. The applicant shall provide evidence demonstrating that the proposed project shall meet the City's adopted level of service standards for drainage. The applicant shall provide for stormwater conveyance capacity equal to or in excess of a ten-year stormwater event for stormwater management and construct retention areas to withstand a 25-year storm event. 
5.  Recreation area. The demand for recreation area shall be determined by multiplying the City's recreation area level of service standard (i.e., 3.5 acres per 1,000 population or 0.0035 acre × each person served by the development). 
Section 3-9.10. - Determination of available capacity. 
    For purposes of these regulations, the available capacity of a facility shall be determined by adding the cumulative total supply for each public facility component as cited in Step 1 and subtracting cumulative total demand for each infrastructure component as cited in Step 2. 
Step 1: Add the indicators of available facility capacity: 
1.  Capacity of existing facility. The total capacity of existing facilities operating at the required level of service; and 
2.  Capacity of committed new facility, excluding roadways. The total capacity of committed new facilities, if any, that will become available on or before the date a certificate of occupancy is issued for the development. The capacity of committed facilities may be counted and deemed concurrent only if the following standards are met: 
a.  The necessary facilities and services are in place at the time a development permit is issued; or 
b.  The development permit is issued subject to the condition that the necessary facilities and services will be in place concurrent with the impacts of development; or 
c.  The necessary public facilities and services are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement to be in place concurrent with the impacts of development. An enforceable development agreement may include, but is not limited to, development agreements pursuant to F.S. § 163.3220, or an agreement or development order issued pursuant to F.S. ch. 380. The agreement must guarantee that the necessary facilities and services will be in place when the impacts of the development occur. 
3.  Capacity of new roadways. The total capacity of new roadways, if any, that will become available on or before the date a certificate of occupancy is issued for the development. The capacity of new roadways may be counted and deemed concurrent only if the standards of Subsection 3-9.10(2) are met. In addition, roadway facilities may be deemed concurrent based on the adopted five-year capital improvements program and schedule which, as a minimum, satisfy the following criteria: 
a.  The five-year capital improvements program must include improvements necessary to correct any identified facility deficiencies and maintain adopted levels of service for existing and permitted development; and 
b.  The five-year capital improvements program must be a realistic, financially feasible program based on currently available revenue sources; and development orders will only be issued if the public facilities necessary to serve the development are programmed to commence and become available within the first three years of the five-year schedule of capital improvements; and 
c.  The five-year capital improvements program must identify whether funding is for design, engineering, consultant fees, or construction and must indicate, by funded year, how the dollars will be allocated; and 
d.  The five-year capital improvements program must identify both the year in which actual construction of the roadway project will commence, together with the anticipated fiscal year at which time construction will be finalized and functional operation of the roadway facility begins. Actual construction and functional operation of the roadway facility must commence on or before the third year of the five-year schedule of capital improvements; and 
e.  In the situation where scheduled projects occur in phases that become functionally operational at the completion of each individual phase, the commencement and completion dates for each independent phase will be identified in the five-year schedule of capital improvements; and 
Step 2: Subtract the committed capacity: 
1.  Existing demand based on existing development. The demand for services or facilities created by existing development as provided by the City. 
2.  Demand to be generated by vested development, valid capacity reservation certificates, and valid certificates of concurrency. The demand for the service or facility created by the anticipated completion of other vested and/or approved developments. 

Footnotes: 
1.  The binder fee shall be credited to the capacity reservation fee. However, if no capacity is reserved within the 60-calendar-day period, the binder fee shall not be refunded. 
2.  Capacity may be reserved for a period of one, two or three years. The capacity reservation fee shall be based on the timeframe selected for the reservation. The fee schedule shall be established by resolution of the City Commission. 
3.  If the capacity reservation expires, the applicant shall be required to demonstrate that "good faith effort" was expended in attempting to obtain a final development order prior to renewing the capacity reservation. If such "good faith effort" is not demonstrated to the City's satisfaction, the applicant shall be required to reapply for concurrency review. In such case, the applicant must wait 60 calendar days prior to reapplying. 
4.  Upon receipt of a final development order, the terms of the final development order shall govern the capacity reservation.

Sec. 3-9.11. - Proportionate fair-share alternative program. 
(A)  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to establish a method whereby the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors, to be known as the Proportionate Fair-Share Program, as required by and in a manner consistent with F.S. § 163.3180(16). 
(B)  Applicability. The Proportionate Fair-Share Program shall apply to all developments in the City that impact a road segment in the City's Concurrency Management System (CMS) and have been notified of a failure to achieve transportation concurrency on a roadway segment or segments. The Proportionate Fair-Share Program does not apply to developments of regional impact (DRIs) using proportionate share under F.S. § 163.3180(12), developments meeting the de minimis standards under F.S. § 163.3180(6), or to developments exempted from concurrency as previously provided in Section 3-9.4, as amended from time to time, of this chapter. 
(C)  General requirements 
(1)  An applicant may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirements of the City by making a proportionate fair-share contribution, pursuant to the following requirements: 
(a)  The proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan and applicable land development regulations. 
(b)  The City's Five Year Capital Improvement Program (CIP) includes a transportation improvement(s) that, upon completion, will accommodate additional traffic generated by the proposed development, as determined by the City Staff. 
(2)  The Public Works Director may choose to allow an applicant to satisfy transportation concurrency through the Proportionate Fair-Share Program by contributing to an improvement that, upon completion, will accommodate additional traffic generated by the proposed development, as projected by City staff using the best available data and methodologies, but is not contained in the capital improvement program where one of the following apply: 
(a)  The City adopts, by resolution or ordinance, a commitment to add the improvement to the Five Year Capital Improvement Program no later than the next regular update. To qualify for consideration under this Section, the proposed improvement must be reviewed by City Staff and must be found to be financially feasible. This means that additional developer contributions or other funding sources are anticipated, during a period not to exceed ten years, to fully mitigate the specified impact(s) on the identified transportation facility or facilities. 
(b)  If, in the opinion of the Public Works Director, the funds in the adopted City Five Year Capital Improvement Program are insufficient to fully fund construction of a transportation improvement required by the concurrency management system, then a proportionate fair-share payment may be required for another improvement which will, in the opinion of the Public Works Director, significantly benefit the impacted transportation system. The improvement or improvements funded by the proportionate fair-share component must be adopted into the capital improvement program of the comprehensive plan at the next annual capital improvements element update. 
(3)  Any improvement project proposed to meet the developer's fair-share obligation must meet generally accepted design standards for the State of Florida and the City of Casselberry. 
(D)  Application process. 
(1)  City Staff shall notify an applicant in writing of a failure to satisfy transportation concurrency requirements. Upon receipt of such notice, applicants may submit a proposed proportionate fair-share calculation to the Public Works Director or designee for review. 
(2)  Pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(16)(e), proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation for development impacts to facilities on the Strategic Inter-modal System requires the concurrence of the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT). 
(3)  When a proportionate fair-share calculation is deemed by the Public Works Director to be sufficient and eligible, a proportionate share agreement will be prepared between the City and the applicant. The stipulations of the agreement shall include but not be limited to the amount of payment, description of work, and timing of payment. The City Commission shall approve and execute a proportionate share agreement on behalf of the City. 
(E)  Determining proportionate fair-share obligation. 
(1)  Proportionate fair-share mitigation for concurrency impacts may include, without limitation, separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land, and construction and contribution of facilities. 
(2)  A development shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate fair-share. The fair market value of the proportionate fair-share mitigation for the impacted facilities shall not differ regardless of the method of mitigation. 
(3)  The methodology used to calculate an applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation shall be as provided for in F.S. § 163.3180(12), as follows: 
Proportionate Share = s [(Development Trips;sub \sub;)/(SV Increase;sub \sub;)] × Cost;sub \sub;] - IMPACT FEE CREDITS 
Where: 
Development Trips i = Those trips from the development that are assigned to roadway segment i and have triggered a deficiency per the concurrency management system; 
SV Increase i = Service volume increase provided by the eligible improvement to roadway segment i per Section E; 
Cost i = Adjusted cost of the improvement to segment i. Cost shall include all improvements and associated costs, such as design, right-of-way acquisition, planning, engineering, inspection, and physical development costs directly associated with construction at the anticipated cost in the year it will be incurred. 
IMPACT FEE CREDITS = See section 3-9.11(F)(1) where applicable. 
(4)  For the purposes of determining proportionate share obligations, the City shall determine improvement costs based upon the projected future cost of the improvement as obtained from the Capital Improvements Program or another method approved by the Public Works Director. 
(5)  The City has the option to accept right-of-way dedication for all or a portion of the proportionate fair-share payment. Credit for the dedication of the non-site related right-of-way shall be assigned a value by appropriate City staff or, at the option of the applicant, by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the City and at no expense to the City. The applicant shall supply a drawing and legal description of the land and a certificate of title or title search of the land to the City at no expense to the City. If the estimated value of the right-of-way dedication proposed by the applicant is less than the City estimated total proportionate fair-share obligation for that development, then the applicant must also pay the difference. 
(F)  Impact fee credit for proportionate fair-share mitigation. 
(1)  Proportionate fair-share mitigation shall be applied as a credit against impact fees if the proposed improvement is on the list of approved projects in the most recent City Impact Fee Ordinance and Technical Report. Credits will be given for that portion of the impact fees that would have been used to fund the improvements on which the proportionate fair-share contribution is calculated. The portion of impact fees available for the credit will be based on the historic distribution of impact fee funds to the arterial roadways and collector roadways in the appropriate impact fee district. Impact fee credits shall be calculated at the same time as the applicant's proportionate share obligation is calculated. 
(2)  Any road impact fee credit based upon proportionate fair-share contributions for a proposed development cannot be transferred to any other parcel or parcels of real property within the City. 
(G)  Appropriation of fair-share revenues. 
(1)  Proportionate fair-share revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the City capital improvements program. 
(2)  In the event a scheduled facility improvement is removed from the Capital Improvement Program, then the revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of another improvement within that same corridor that would mitigate the impacts of development pursuant to the requirements of Subsection (C)(2)(b) of this Section. 
(3)  Where an applicant constructs a transportation facility that exceeds the applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation calculated under Subsection (2), then the City shall reimburse the applicant for the excess contribution using impact fee credits. These credits will not be transferable as discussed in Subsection (F)(2) of this Section. Where excess contributions exceed impact fee credits, the City may reimburse such funds as cash or through other methods acceptable to the applicant and the Public Works Director.

Section 3-9.12. - Public school facility concurrency. 
A.  The following terms are used in discussing level of service standards for public schools: 
    Proportionate Share Mitigation: A developer improvement or contribution identified in a binding and enforceable agreement between the Developer, the School Board and the local government with jurisdiction over the approval of the development approval to provide compensation for the additional demand on educational facilities created through the residential development of the property, as set forth in F.S. § 163.3180(13)(e). 
    Permanent Florida Inventory of School Houses (FISH): Meaning the permanent facilities within the inventory of land, buildings and rooms in public educational facilities used by the Florida Department of Education, Office of Educational Facilities; and 
    Concurrency Service Area (CSA): A geographic unit promulgated by the School Board and adopted by local governments within which the level of service is measured when an application for residential development is reviewed for school concurrency purposes. The CSA coincides with groupings of school attendance zones within each school type based on adjacency. 
    Level of Service (LOS) standard: A standard established to measure utilization of capacity within a Concurrency Service Area (CSA). Current LOS within a CSA is determined by dividing the full-time equivalent student count (FTE) for the Fall Semester at the same type of schools by the permanent FISH capacity of the same type of schools. Projected or future LOS is determined by dividing the projected enrolled students at the same type of schools within a CSA by the planned permanent FISH capacity of the same type of schools. 
B.  Use of Concurrency Service Area (CSA) Boundaries. The City shall apply school concurrency using CSA boundaries adopted by the School Board. The CSAs are described geographically in Maps 1-3 of the support documents of the Comprehensive Plan and may be updated from time to time by the School Board. 
C.  CSAs for Each Type of School. The CSA boundaries established by the School Board will be based on clustered attendance zones for each school type (elementary, middle and high school) based on adjacency and will be re-evaluated by the School Board, as needed. 
D.  Concurrency Review. The City shall require that all new residential development be reviewed for school concurrency prior to the issuance of development approval of a site plan, a final subdivision plan or the functional equivalent. 
E.  Development Review Process. The City shall withhold or condition the approval of any site plan, final subdivision, or functional equivalent for new residential units not exempted from concurrency until a school capacity availability letter determination (SCALD) has been issued by the school board to the city indicating that adequate school facilities exist or until a mitigation agreement has been reached, pursuant to the availability standard specified in section 163.3180(13)(e), Florida Statutes. 
F.  Notification of Submittal of Residential Applications. The City shall notify the School Board within 15 working days of receipt of any land use or development application having a residential component and will transmit submitted subdivision plans and site plans to the school board for their review. 
G.  Residential Uses Exempt from the Requirements of School Concurrency. The following residential uses shall be exempt from the requirements of school concurrency: 
1.  All single-family lots of record at the time the school concurrency implementing ordinance became effective on January 1, 2008. 
2.  Any new residential development that has a preliminary plat or site plan approval or the functional equivalent for a site specific development order prior to the commencement date of the School Concurrency Program on January 1, 2008. 
3.  Any amendment to a previously approved residential development which does not increase the number of dwelling units or change the type of dwelling units. 
4.  Any age-restricted community with no permanent residents under the age of 18 (a restrictive covenant limiting the age of residents to 18 and older shall be required). 
H.  Level of Service (LOS) Standard. To ensure the capacity of schools is sufficient to support student growth, the City shall apply a LOS standard for schools. The desired LOS standard shall be 100 percent of the aggregate permanent FISH capacity for each school type within each CSA. 
    To financially achieve the desired LOS standard at the high school level, a tiered LOS standard is established as follows: 
2008-2012 Beginning 2013 Elementary and Middle School CSA 100% of Permanent FISH Capacity 100% of Permanent FISH Capacity High School CSA 110% of Permanent FISH Capacity 100% of Permanent FISH Capacity  
I.  Results of Concurrency Review. The City shall not deny development approval due to failure to achieve the adopted LOS for public school facilities when the following occurs: 
1.  Adequate school facilities are planned and will be in place or under construction within three years of the development approval. 
2.  The developer executes a legally binding commitment to provide mitigation proportionate to the demand for public school facilities consistent with the methodology below. 
J.  Proportionate Share Mitigation. In the event there is not available school capacity to support a development, the School Board may entertain proportionate share mitigation options and, if accepted, shall enter into an enforceable and binding agreement with the developer to mitigate the impact from the development through the creation of additional school capacity. 
1.  When the anticipated student impacts from a proposed development cause the adopted LOS to be exceeded, the developer's proportionate share will be based on the number of additional student stations necessary to achieve the established LOS. The amount to be paid will be calculated by the cost per student station for elementary, middle and high school as determined and published by the State of Florida. 
2.  The methodology used to calculate a developer's proportionate share mitigation shall be as follows: 
Proportionate Share = ( 1 Development students - Available Capacity) × 2 Total Cost per student station 
Where: 
1 Development students = those students from the development that are assigned to a CSA and have triggered a deficiency of the available capacity. 
2 Total Cost = the cost per student station as determined and published by the State of Florida. 
3.  The applicant shall be allowed to enter a 90-day negotiation period with the School Board in an effort to mitigate the impact from the development through the creation of additional capacity. Upon identification and acceptance of a mitigation option deemed financially feasible by the School Board, the developer shall enter into a binding and enforceable development agreement with the School Board. 
a.  A mitigation contribution provided by a developer to offset the impact of a residential development must be directed by the School Board toward a school capacity project identified in the School Board's Five-Year Capital Improvement Plan. Capacity enhancing projects identified within the first three years of the Five-Year Capital Improvement Plan shall be considered as committed. 
b.  If capacity projects are planned in years four or five of the School Board's Five-Year Capital Improvement Plan within the same CSA as the proposed residential development, the developer may pay his proportionate share to mitigate the proposed development. 
c.  If a capacity project does not exist in the Capital Improvement Plan, the School Board will add a capacity project to satisfy the impacts from a proposed residential development, if it is funded through the developer's proportionate share mitigation contributions. Mitigation options may include, but are not limited to: 
i.  Contribution of land or payment for land acquisition suitable for and in conjunction with, the provision of additional school capacity; or 
ii.  Mitigation banking based on the construction of an educational facility in exchange for the right to sell capacity credits; or 
iii.  Provide modular or permanent student stations acceptable for use as an educational facilities; or 
iv.  Provide additional student stations through the remodeling of existing buildings acceptable for use as an educational facility; or 
v.  Construction or expansion of permanent student stations at the impacted school within the CSA; or 
vi.  Construction of an educational facility in advance of the time set forth in the School Board's Five-Year Capital Improvement Plan. 
4.  For mitigation measures (i) thru (vi) above, the estimated cost to construct the mitigating capacity will reflect the estimated future construction costs at the time of the anticipated construction. Improvements contributed by the developer shall receive school impact fee credit. 
5.  Developer shall receive an impact fee credit for the proportionate share mitigation. Credits will be given for that portion of the impact fees that would have been used to fund the improvements on which the proportionate fair share contribution was calculated. The portion of impact fees available for the credit will be based on the historic distribution of impact fee funds to the school type (elementary, middle, high) in the appropriate CSA. Impact fee credits shall be calculated at the same time as the applicant's proportionate share obligation is calculated. Any school impact fee credit based on proportionate fair share contributions for a proposed development cannot be transferred to any other parcel or parcels of real property within the CSA. 
6.  A proportionate share mitigation contribution shall not be subsequently amended or refunded after final site plan or plat approval to reflect a reduction in planned or constructed residential density. 
7.  Impact fees shall be credited against the proportionate share mitigation total. 
8.  Any proportionate share mitigation must be directed by the School Board toward a school capacity improvement identified in the School Board's Five-Year Capital Improvement Plan. 
9.  Upon conclusion of the negotiation period, a second Determination Letter shall be issued. If mitigation is agreed to, the School Board shall issue a new Determination Letter approving the development subject to those mitigation measures agreed to by the local government, developer and the School Board. Prior to, site plan approval, final subdivision approval or the functional equivalent, the mitigation measures shall be memorialized in an enforceable and binding agreement with the local government, the School Board and the Developer that specifically details mitigation provisions to be paid for by the developer and the relevant terms and conditions. If mitigation is not agreed to, the Determination Letter shall detail why any mitigation proposals were rejected and why the development is not in compliance with school concurrency requirements. A SCALD indicating either that adequate capacity is available, or that there is not a negotiated proportionate share mitigation settlement following the 90-day negotiation period constitutes final agency action by the School Board for purposes of Chapter 120, F.S. 
K.  Appeal Process. A person substantially affected by a School Board's adequate capacity determination made as a part of the School Concurrency Process may appeal such determination through the process provided in Chapter 120, F.S. 
(Ord. No. 09-1265, § 1, 2-9-09) 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 09-1265, § 1, Feb. 9, 2009, set out provisions intended for use as § 3-9.11. Inasmuch as § 3-9.11 currently exists in the Code, and at the editor's discretion, these provisions have been included as § 3-9.12. 
ARTICLE X. - APPEARANCE, DESIGN AND COMPATIBILITY 
    The City of Casselberry shall not approve a site plan unless a finding is made that such site plan conforms to all applicable provisions of the land development regulations. 

Section 3-10.1. - Site location and character of use. 
    The Comprehensive Plan together with the land development regulations, including size and dimension regulations, general provisions, performance standards, and the list of permitted and conditional uses, offstreet parking, landscaping, required open spaces, yards and building setbacks, shall collectively be the principal guides in determining the suitability of the location of the proposed use. 
Section 3-10.2. - Appearance of site and structures. 
    Within all zoning districts within the City of Casselberry, the appearance of site and structures shall be coordinated for the purpose of creating a pleasing and harmonious overall environment within this section and Section 2-7.35. The choice of building materials, plant materials, lighting and other building and site improvements shall be commensurate with the objectives of the subject use and considering impact on surrounding properties or transportation corridors.

ARTICLE XI. - ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION 

Section 3-11.1. - Preservation of wetlands. 
    In order to promote and preserve natural hydrological conditions and to preserve water recharge areas, water supply, water quality, environmentally sensitive areas, and natural habitats, the following regulations shall be applied to wetlands. 
A.  Definitions. Wetlands shall be defined based on hydrology as well as hydric soil and wetland vegetation. Wetlands shall include those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do or would support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Flora and fauna species which shall be protected by the regulations of Section 3-11.7 are listed in Official Lists of Endangered and Potentially Endangered Fauna and Flora in Florida, Florida Game and Freshwater Fish Commission, latest edition and as hereafter may be amended. Wetland boundaries shall be made in accordance with the requirements of the FDER, SJRWMD, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and shall include the largest or most inclusive area whether isolated or contiguous with a natural or artificial water body. The City reserves the right to regulate construction activities or any physical alteration of wetlands whether or not such activities are regulated by state or federal permitting agencies. 
B.  Wetland development restrictions and interpretations. Wetlands serve a vital natural function to filter contaminants carried by surface water percolating to groundwater aquifers. Wetlands also are vital to the quantity of water reaching aquifer storage sheds. No development shall be permitted in wetlands excepting where state and/or federal agencies having jurisdiction provide for alteration of the wetland. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Florida Department of Environmental Regulation and St. Johns River Water Management District definitions shall be used to ascertain wetlands within the City of Casselberry. For purposes of land management, the City will employ the definition which allows it to claim the larger area. Wetlands possess three essential characteristics: (1) hydrophytic vegetation, or plant life with a water or water-saturated soils habitat; (2) hydric soils, or soils that are water-saturated; and (3) wetland hydrology or permanent or periodic inundation of soils to the surface by water. 
In cases where the agencies having jurisdiction determine that wetlands may be altered, the City shall coordinate with the jurisdictional agencies for purposes of rendering legal, equitable, and environmentally sensitive determinations of the development rights to be permitted on such waters and/or lands under the jurisdiction of the state or federal government. Regardless of actions or inactivities by federal or state permitting agencies, the City shall reserve the right to determine the appropriate land use, density/intensity, and special mitigation measures including, but not limited to, maximum mitigation ratios to be imposed on a development. The applicant shall bear the burden of proof in determining that development shall not adversely impact wetlands. 
Where the City Unified Land Development Regulations provide for development rights within wetlands for lots of record in residential areas, the density shall in no case exceed 0.2 unit per acre. In addition, the density (i.e., 0.2 unit per acre) may accrue to the adjacent upland which is under unified control. 
Such determinations shall be based on physical and biological data obtained from specific site investigations. These determinations shall be predicated on findings rendered by professionals competent in producing data and analysis necessary to support impact assessments, including findings regarding the impacts of potential development on the physical and biological value and function of environmentally sensitive lands. 
C.  Wetland buffer zones. Wetlands shall be protected from impacts generated by adjacent land uses through natural upland buffer zones. The upland buffer is an area landward of the upland edge of a wetland (i.e., the upland/wetland jurisdictional line). The buffer area has a direct groundwater or surface water influence and provides an upland buffer which separates developed upland from a wetland area. The purpose of the buffer area is to ensure the continuing function of respective wetland communities, prevent pollutants from surface water runoff from entering the wetlands, and to enhance water quality. 
Development within wetland buffer zones shall comply with the requirements of this Section and, as a minimum, be consistent with applicable state and federal regulatory policies affecting the specific sites. However, where conflicts between the City, state and federal regulatory policies conflict, the more restrictive shall prevail. The exact boundary of an upland buffer area shall be established by field investigation and shall be sufficient to protect adjacent wetlands. 
1.  Establishing the wetland line. The wetland line shall be established based upon field survey of site, of field surveys of the site by a professional biologist or registered engineer provided by the applicant and verified by the St. Johns River Water Management District, the DER, and/or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The field investigation which delineates a larger area shall be used as the wetland line. 
2.  Vegetative buffers. Environmentally sensitive areas including wetlands and Class III waters shall provide buffers of 50 feet. Buffers shall be 25 feet on lots less than five acres created prior to February 17, 1992. New and redeveloped areas and arterial roadways shall provide buffers of 50 feet. No hazardous waste shall be stored or disposed of on upland buffers. 
Should it be necessary to establish or replenish shoreline vegetation or littoral zones, the developer should consult Appendix A, Aquatic Plants Suitable for Establishment of Littoral Zones and Shoreline Restoration, and an excerpt from Aquascaping: Planting and Maintenance, Circular 912 published by IFAS. This appendix will provide a list of suitable water-oriented plants for varying site conditions as well as nondesirable plants. Aquatic planting that is necessary shall be illustrated on the required landscape plan submittal for site plan review (reference Section 3-13.10). 
Natural buffer zones shall be based on guidelines contained in Buffer Zones for Water, Wetlands, and Wildlife (Center for Wetlands; Brown, Schaefer, and Brandt, 1989). An applicant for development may propose alternative methodology, but such methodology shall be subject to verification and must address the following: 
a.  Erodibility of soils upland of the wetland line; 
b.  Depth of the water table below the soil surface in the zone immediately upland of the wetland line; and 
c.  Habitat requirements of aquatic and wetland dependent wildlife based on: 
i.  Habitat suitability; 
ii.  Spatial requirements; 
iii.  Access to upland habitat; and 
iv.  Noise impacts. 
3.  Required dedication of conservation easements. The City may require applicants for site plan approval or subdivision development approval to include the dedication of conservation easements or reservations where the City finds that the dedication is warranted in order to protect the value and function of a wetland and upland buffer. 
Section 3-11.2. - Soil erosion and sedimentation control. 
A.  Applicability. In order to prevent both soil erosion and sedimentation, a soil erosion and sedimentation control plan shall be required as a part of an application for site plan review whenever a development will involve any clearing, grading, or other form of disturbing land by the movement of earth. 
B.  Definitions. For the purposes of this Article the following definitions are provided: 
1.  Soil erosion: Any removal and/or loss of soil by the action of water, gravity, or wind. Erosion includes both the detachment and transport of soil particles. 
2.  Sedimentation: The settling out of the soil particles which are transported by water or wind. Sedimentation occurs when the velocity of water or wind in which soil particles are suspended is slowed to a sufficient degree and for a sufficient period of time to allow the particles to settle out of suspension or when the degree of slope is lessened to achieve the same result. 
3.  Erodible slope: All slopes with inclines in excess of four percent unless modified by the City Engineer based on consideration of specific soil conditions. 
4.  Large flat surface area (unpaved): An area which is flat or whose slope is less than four percent and which consists of more than 1,000 square feet of exposed soil. 
C.  Erosion control measures. All measures necessary to minimize soil erosion and to control sedimentation in the disturbed land area shall be implemented. The following protection shall be provided for all disturbed areas: minimize velocities of water runoff, maximize protection of disturbed areas from stormwater runoff, and prevent or retain sedimentation within the development site as early as possible following disturbances. 
D.  Applicability. Appropriate measures shall be taken during land clearing and building operations to assure that exposed, destabilized or otherwise altered soil is expeditiously covered with an acceptable erosion control material. The provision shall be applicable to the act of subdividing and installation of related improvements as well as during the development review process including the period during which improvements may occur as well as the length of time soil may be exposed to the environment. 
    The tree and native vegetation protection ordinance shall be applicable to all clearing and grading activities and shall include specifications for management principles guiding the removal or placement of vegetation and landscaping design. Regulations shall also require developers to take precautionary measures, where necessary, to avert destruction or damage to native vegetation. 
Section 3-11.3. - Wellhead protection. 
A.  Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of this Section is to protect potable water from contamination by establishing a protection area around municipal potable water wells and prohibiting certain land uses and activities within the area which have the potential to contaminate groundwater. 
B.  The regulations set forth herein shall apply to all development proposed in area surrounding a wellhead. 
C.  Establishment of wellhead protection area. A Wellhead Protection Area means an area designated by the City of Casselberry consisting of a 500 foot radial setback distance around a potable water well where ground water is provided the most stringent protection measures to protect the ground water source for a potable water well and includes the subsurface and surrounding the well.

(Ord. No. 99-930, § I, 4-5-99) 
Section 3-11.4. - Aquifer recharge protection. 
    The City rests on an area with high aquifer recharge potential. To maintain the natural rate of percolation within aquifer recharge areas, development applications shall comply with the following requirements: 
A.  Surface water management. Development plans shall maximize quality and quantity of stormwater percolating downward to groundwater storage areas. The provisions of Article XII governing stormwater management, including onsite retention and detention of surface runoff, shall be met. Onsite retention structures for new development shall be designed for net retention and infiltration of predevelopment recharge to groundwater aquifers. Chapter 40C-42, F.A.C., regulating retention of the first one inch of rainfall, shall be satisfied. 
B.  Compatible land use for preserving groundwater quality. Pursuant to provisions of Article V certain acceptable manufacturing uses meeting nuisance abatement performance standards may be permitted as conditional uses within commercial land use districts, provided that the use does not exceed the density and intensity of use allowed within the commercial district and shall be restricted according to sanitary sewer as set forth within F.S. § 381.272. 
C.  Impervious surface and open space ratios. The impervious surface and open space ratios established in Article V shall govern all development. 
D.  Specific restrictions on development within recharge areas. All development within designated prime recharge areas shall comply with the following development requirements: 
1.  Development shall be required to preserve predevelopment topography with regard to soil type, drainage rates, and grade elevation, and shall be designed so as to minimize the reduction of recharge of the surficial aquifer. The groundwater level and fluctuations shall be no worse than under predevelopment conditions. 
2.  Removal of soil from a development site or any portion thereof which is located above 25 feet mean sea level (MSL) is prohibited. On such sites or portions thereof the reduction of the natural topography shall be limited to six feet above the normal high water table (with the exception of drainage conveyance or retention ponds) or eight feet below existing land surface, whichever is more restrictive. 
3.  No clearing of soil or vegetation may occur before a permit is issued. 
4.  No excavation which cuts below the seasonal high water table (this practice lowers the water table level) shall be allowed. This includes but is not limited to excavations for building foundations, parking lots, and site drainage. Open drainage conveyances below the normal high water table shall be prohibited. Underground piping of stormwater is required when inverts are lower than the normal high water table. 
5.  Impermeable surfaces of recharge areas shall be regulated as follows: 
a.  Development on sites with any land having an elevation no greater than 25 feet above mean sea level (MSL) shall restrict impermeable surfaces to 50 percent of the total area of the site which is 25 feet or less MSL. 
b.  Development on sites with any land exceeding 25 feet mean sea level (MSL) shall restrict impermeable surfaces to 35 percent of the total area of the site which is above 25 feet MSL. 
E.  Prohibited land uses. The following land uses and activities are prohibited within prime aquifer recharge areas: 
1.  Sanitary landfills; 
2.  Wastewater treatment facilities;

d.  Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 355, Appendix A and B (List of Extremely Hazardous Substances). 
5.  Aboveground or belowground pipes for pollutants or contaminants. 
Section 3-11.5. - Lakeshore protection. 
A.  Shoreline protection and lakefront littoral zone established. To protect lakes from nutrient enrichment and degraded biological diversity, a shoreline protection zone shall be established. This zone shall include existing aquatic vegetation, wetlands, and the upland buffer. 
B.  Land use restrictions within lakeshore protection zone. Only passive and water-related recreation activities, if authorized by Department of Environmental Regulation, St. Johns River Water Management District and Department of Natural Resources, shall be permitted within the shoreline protection zone. No other construction activity shall encroach into the lakeshore protection zone. 
C.  Shoreline protection plan. Development occurring adjacent to lake shoreline or wetland areas shall prepare a design and management plan as part of the required site plan prior to the construction of any onsite stormwater management system. This plan shall include the following: 
1.  Plan for vegetative cover. The shoreline protection plan shall include a narrative and graphic presentation demonstrating that native vegetation shall be preserved as mandated by the tree and native vegetation protection policies of the Comprehensive Plan. Only native vegetation shall be planted and maintained within the shoreline and lakefront littoral zone. The plan for vegetative cover shall specify how vegetation is to be established within this zone, including the extent, method, type and timing of any planting to be provided. The plan should also include the removal of non-native or nuisance species. 
2.  Plan for shoreline and lakefront littoral zone management. The shoreline protection plan shall include a shoreline management plan that describes procedures to ensure minimal impacts to water quality and shoreline erosion. Where deemed necessary, silt screening shall be implemented to retain effluvial sediments carried by runoff stormwater or wave action. The plan shall comply with the erosion and sedimentation performance standards of this Article. The plan shall also include: 
a.  Cross sections of shoreline management plan. Include typical cross sections of the surface water management system showing the average water elevation and the three-foot contour (i.e., below average elevation) or a 75-foot distance from the wetland buffer, whichever is greater. 
b.  Lakefront littoral zone management strategies. Provide a description of any management procedure to be followed in order to ensure the continued viability and health of the lakefront littoral zone. The lakefront littoral zone as established shall consist entirely of native vegetation and shall be maintained permanently as part of the water management system. Development within the lakefront littoral zone shall be limited to water-dependent structures defined within the land development regulations. The developer's lakefront littoral zone management plan shall include a plan acceptable to the City for the longterm management and maintenance of stormwater, lake, and lakefront shoreline. The burden for perpetual maintenance rests with the property owner. Should the City establish a Citywide utility district, the City may implement a City management strategy to be funded through an equitable assessment of property owners. 
c.  Should it be necessary to establish or replenish shoreline vegetation or littoral zones, the developer should consult Appendix A, Aquatic Plants Suitable for Establishment of Littoral Zones and Shoreline Restoration, and an excerpt from Aquascaping: Planting and Maintenance, Circular 912 published by IFAS. This appendix will provide a list of suitable water-oriented plants for varying site conditions as well as nondesirable plants. Any aquatic planting that is necessary shall be illustrated on the required landscape plan submitted for site plan review (reference Section 3-13.10). 
3.  Plan for protecting Class III waters. All lakes within or adjacent to the City are Class III waters. Plans for lakeshore protection shall include the following protective measures: 
a.  Dredging and filling activities shall be limited to FDER, FDNR, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and SJRWMD and any other applicable agency approved dredging. 
b.  Ensure good water quality by coordinating with the FDER, FDNR, and the St. Johns River Water Management District in monitoring the quality of stormwater runoff and all discharge. The City shall notify the appropriate agency with jurisdiction as potential issues or problems are identified by the City. 
c.  Limit the use of Class III waters to water-dependent activities that are in the public interest and satisfy a community need. 
d.  Protection of aquatic and wetland wildlife and vegetative species. 
4.  Required wetland buffer zones. The lakefront protection plan shall comply with performance criteria applicable to wetland buffer zones within the Article. 
5.  Monitoring and management. Development shall ensure that the shoreline management plan is conducted in accordance with the plan by performing monitoring in accordance with the plan authorized by state and federal permits. However, the City may require additional monitoring deemed appropriate. 
D.  Exemptions to the lakefront protection regulations. The following activities shall be exempt from the lakefront protection regulations: 
1.  Minor maintenance or emergency repair to existing structures or improved areas. 
2.  Clearing of shoreline vegetation to create walking trails having no structural components, not to exceed four feet in width. The City reserves the power to restrict the number and design of walking trails. 
3.  Timber catwalks, docks, and trail bridges that are less than four feet wide, provided that no filling, flooding, dredging, draining, ditching, tiling or excavating is done, except limited filling and excavating necessary for the installation of pilings. 
4.  Recreational fishing and temporary blinds. 
5.  Constructing fences where no fill activity is required and where navigational access will not be impaired by construction of the fence. 
Notwithstanding, any permitted development shall provide a plan acceptable to the City which ensures maintenance of water quality and shoreline integrity in perpetuity. 
Section 3-11.6. - Sinkholes. 
    Sinkholes generally have unstable soils and high relief of slopes. The City finds regulation of development in the vicinity of sinkholes necessary in order to protect the public from potential damage resulting from sinkhole collapse and to protect groundwater quality from potential contamination. Such contamination may be introduced through sinkhole passages that provide for rapid downward percolation of contaminants into groundwater storage areas. Therefore, development occurring adjacent to an existing sinkhole shall be subject to development restrictions. Such development restrictions shall be determined on a case-by-case basis according to the geological and hydrological circumstances causing the formation. The developer shall be required to submit an environmental audit certified by a competent professional that addresses the above-noted geological and hydrological circumstances and shall certify that a proposed development is not potentially disruptive to the natural or manmade environment and promotes public health, safety and welfare. The City shall require any such developer to hold the City harmless from any and all further claims arising from such proposed development. 
Section 3-11.7. - Upland habitat preservation and protection of flora and fauna. 
    Vegetative communities and wildlife habitats (particularly those identified as habitat for endangered or threatened species or species of special concern) which are deemed environmentally significant shall be protected from adverse impacts associated with development. Endangered and potentially endangered fauna and flora species indigenous to habitats as identified in Section 3-11.1(A) shall be protected pursuant to this Section. 
    Applicants for development within any areas identified as refuge, breeding, feeding, or habitat areas of endangered or threatened species or species of special concern shall prepare a habitat management plan which shall as a minimum include the following: 
1.  Critical habitat management plan required. Site plans and preliminary plats shall include a "Critical Habitat Management Plan" prepared by a professional biologist, ecologist, or other related professional. The plan shall ensure the protection of endangered and threatened flora and fauna as identified in Section 3-11.1(A) which shall be protected pursuant to this Section. As a minimum standard this plan shall analyze the following issues: 
a.  Identify the occurrences of designated species by a qualified ecologist; 
b.  Land needs to support continued onsite presence of the species; 
c.  Impacts of proposed development which will disturb the species; 
d.  Management plans and measures necessary to protect the subject species; 
e.  Cost to developer to implement the management plan as approved. 
2.  Criteria for reviewing critical habitat plan. Development activities which have an adverse effect upon a designated species shall require mitigation acceptable to the City or shall not be permitted. Viable (i.e., capable of living) habitat for endangered or threatened species or species of special concern occurring on a site shall be identified on the management plans as preservation areas. All development activities shall be prohibited within these preservation areas with the exception of recreational and educational uses where such uses will not adversely affect such species. 
The City staff shall review the critical habitat management plan as well as the federal and/or state agencies having jurisdiction. The final development plan shall comply with directives of the federal and/or state or local agencies having jurisdiction and the most restrictive shall apply. 
3.  Reservation of conservation easements. The applicant shall provide a conservation easement which ensures the preservation of habitats. 
Section 3-11.8. - Land use and soil compatibility. 
    Land use activities, including their densities and intensities, shall be compatible with soil types. Soil on sites proposed for development shall have properties capable of supporting the proposed development. 
    In the event the future land use map or the official zoning map identifies a land use allowed within an incompatible soil type, a field study may be performed on the site by a professional hydrologist, registered engineer, soil scientist or other professional competent in delineating and evaluating actual soil types exhibited on the subject site. The City shall reserve the right to have such a field study verified by the local U.S. Soil Conservation Office or a comparable state agency and shall render a decision ensuring that the land use is compatible with the soil type. 
Section 3-11.9. - Floodplain protection. 
    The following regulations, together with the provisions of Article XII, Stormwater Management, and provisions contained in the City of Casselberry Code, shall apply to all construction within the City of Casselberry. 
1.  Purpose and intent of floodplain management. Floodplains serve the following important functions in the hydrologic cycle: 
  Floodplains provide natural storage and conveyance of floodwaters; 
  The water on flooded lands may provide recharges to groundwater and is a basic source of flow to rivers, streams and estuaries; 
  Temporary storage of surface waters on floodplains regulates flood elevations and the timing, velocity and rate of flood discharges; 
  Floodplains maintain water quality by reducing erosion, removing nutrients and other pollutants and allowing sediment to settle; and 
  Natural floodplains export detritus and other food sources to open water bodies and are vital habitat for fish, birds, wildlife and native plant communities. 
Regulation of development within floodplains is necessary in order to accomplish the following objectives: 
  To minimize the potential for property damage and personal injury from flooding; 
  To restrict adverse interference with the normal movement of surface waters; 
  To maintain the optimum storage capacity of watersheds; 
  To maintain desirable groundwater levels; 
  To maintain the natural hydrological and ecological functions of wetlands and other floodprone lands; 
  To prevent increased erosion and sedimentation; and 
  To maintain water quality. 
2.  Minimize development within upland flood zone. This Subsection regulates the uplands within the 100-year flood zone. Wetlands, on the other hand, are regulated pursuant to Section 3-11.1 herein. Land outside wetlands but situated within the 100-year flood zone as delineated on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's federal insurance rate maps are referred to as "uplands of the flood zone." 
3.  Required floodplain protection techniques. Applicants for development and redevelopment shall be required to position structures and impervious surfaces to areas outside the floodplain zone to the extent lawful and pursuant to provisions stipulated below. Where development occurs within the flood zone, to maintain reasonable use of land and to avoid a taking without just compensation, compensatory mitigation shall be required to maintain minimal loss of its natural flow regime as stipulated herein. The 100-year flood zone is delineated within the Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map series, and its demarcations are determined by the most recent issue of flood insurance maps prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
The following limitations and restrictions shall apply to all development allowed within flood zone areas: 
a.  Compensatory mitigation. Where the applicant chooses to develop on uplands of the 100-year floodplain, compensatory storage shall be provided through excavation of a volume of uplands equivalent to the loss of storage within the 100-year flood zone caused by the placement of fill or the construction of impervious surface. Whenever possible adjacent uplands outside the flood zone are eligible to be excavated. 
b.  Additional open space requirements. Open space requirements stipulated in Article V shall be increased by five percent above stipulated requirements when alteration to uplands of the flood zone occurs through compensatory storage. Open space shall be located within flood zone areas to the maximum extent possible. 
c.  Impervious surface principles. In the event compensatory mitigation is instituted, maximum impervious surface area principles shall be reduced by five percent. 
d.  Stormwater facilities. Drainage facilities shall be in place and functional concurrent with criteria established in the concurrency management system. Such drainage facilities shall be designed to: 
i.  Comply with the City's established level of service standards and state stormwater facility standards cited in Article IX: Concurrency Management; 
ii.  Maintain the natural flow regime and function of the floodplain; 
iii.  Support and further regional stormwater policies prepared by the SJRWMD. 
Section 3-11.10. - Construction of driveways, swales, and other improvements affecting drainage. 
    The design of new or existing driveways or other elements within the circulation system potentially impacting drainage shall be approved by the City Engineer prior to commencement of construction or excavation activity. Review by the City Engineer is necessary in order to ensure that: (1) new driveways and other elements of the circulation system provide adequate drainage, swales, ditches or similar stormwater channels; and (2) improvements to existing driveways or other elements of the circulation system are designed to protect and/or enhance existing or planned drainage improvements, as deemed appropriate by the City Engineer. Driveways are encouraged to be paved and culverts shall be designed to meet FDOT standards. The City Engineer shall administer the provisions of this Section based on generally accepted engineering principles and practices. 
Section 3-11.11. - Conservation of potable water supply. 
    The City shall assist in regulating development for purposes of complying with policies of the St. Johns River Water Management District directed toward conservation of potable water supply and to achieve a reduction in the current rates of water consumption. Therefore, site plans shall be required to comply with the following potable water supply performance criteria: 
1.  Where nonpotable alternative sources of irrigation water are available, potable water supplies shall not be used to meet irrigation needs. 
2.  All new development shall be required to use water-saving plumbing fixtures. 
3.  In order to reduce demand for irrigation water (which in turn often places greater demand upon potable water sources), at least 70 percent of all landscaping material obtained from offsite sources for use on any site should be native plant material adapted to soil and climatic conditions existing on the subject site. Further, at least 50 percent of all trees used in landscaping shall be drought-tolerant native species adapted to soil and climatic conditions existing onsite in order to lessen water demand. 
4.  The City shall require, to the extent lawful, reuse of water, including use of cisterns for collecting rainwater for use in spray irrigation. In addition, the City may require mandatory hookup to systems distributing reclaimed water within 500 feet of the site. 
Section 3-11.12. - Hazardous waste storage and disposal. 
    No hazardous wastes shall be stored or disposed of on lands designated "Conservation" on the Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map. Similarly, no hazardous wastes shall be stored or disposed of on upland buffers pursuant to this Article. 
Section 3-11.13. - Irrigation wells. 
    The City is committed to the protection of its resources and its permitted development. The City shall enforce the following permitting procedures to mitigate potential adverse impacts on land use caused by the construction of irrigation wells. Any proposed irrigation well shall require submission of a plan which demonstrates compliance with the regulatory criteria cited herein. 
    Irrigation wells as regulated herein are defined as: wells constructed for the obtaining of groundwater for the irrigation of lawns and landscaping, and whose size or capacity is below the thresholds for regulation by state agencies.

ARTICLE XII. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 

Section 3-12.1. - Purpose and intent. 
    This Article is intended to protect water resources in the City, recognizing that they are critical to the public health, safety, and welfare. This Article is intended to encourage innovative approaches to stormwater management. The concurrent control of erosion, sedimentation, and flooding is mandatory. The following provisions shall apply to both public and private improvements. 
Section 3-12.2. - Definitions. 
    Addition or alteration: Any work beyond maintenance of the existing condition including additions or alterations to an existing system, changes of any part of an existing system to capacities or locations different from those originally constructed, and changes in the rate, volume, or timing of discharges. 
    Adverse impacts: Any modifications, alterations or effects upon a feature or characteristic of water or floodprone land, which are, or potentially may be, harmful or injurious to human health, welfare, safety or property, or which unreasonably interfere with the enjoyment of life or property, including outdoor recreation. The term includes secondary and cumulative as well as direct impacts. 
    Detention (or to detain): The collection and temporary storage of stormwater in such a manner as to provide for treatment through physical, chemical, or biological processes with subsequent gradual release of the stormwater to the receiving waters, in which the capacity for the specified treatment volume of stormwater is again provided within 72 hours following a storm event. 
    Development project: Any manmade change or improvement to land which increases the amount of impervious cover or results in the change in elevation of any portion of the land or changes the existing stormwater system and flood management system. A development project shall include but shall not be limited to all projects which require site plan or subdivision approval under the City's land development regulations. 
    Discharge: The outflow of water from a project site, drainage basin or other facility. 
    Drainage system (artificial): Any canal, ditch, culvert, dike, storm sewer or other manmade facility which tends to control the surface flow of water. 
    Drainage system (natural): Surface streams or marshes which convey water to natural points of drainage. 
    Elevation: Height in feet expressed in relation to mean sea level and referenced to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD). 
    Filtration or to filter: The selective removal of suspended matter from stormwater by passing the water through suitable fine-textured granular media such as porous soil, sand and gravel or other natural or artificial aggregate, which may be used in conjunction with filter fabric or underdrain pipe or both. 
    Flood or flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    Flood insurance rate map (FIRM): An official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    Flood insurance study: The official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the flood boundary-floodway map and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
    Floodway: The normal channel of a watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must remain unobstructed to convey the regulatory flood discharge without raising flood elevations above specified levels as determined in Section 1-10.7 [sic] (A) through (D). 
    Hydrograph: A graph of discharge, or, for the purposes of these regulations, volume of stormwater, versus time required for each selected outfall point. 
    Impervious surface: A surface which is highly resistant to infiltration by water. It includes surfaces such as compacted sand, limerock, or clay, as well as most conventionally surfaced streets, roofs, sidewalks, porous and nonporous parking lots and other similar structures. 
    Legal positive outfall: Is the availability of a permanent and legally established watercourse or similar facility or means which has the hydraulic capability of conveying the stormwater discharge from a development project to receiving waters downstream. "Legally established watercourse" refers to a watercourse which is established by either an express easement, plat dedication, or other documentation, or implied easement or servitude as may be demonstrated to exist in accordance with Florida law. 
    Lowest floor: The top surface of the lowest area within the inside perimeter of the exterior walls of a building. For slab-on-grade type buildings or buildings with basements the top surface of the slab or basement floor would constitute the lowest floor. For footing, foundation walls, or pile type buildings with crawl spaces under the building without basements, the top surface of the finished flooring above the horizontal joist, beam or other supporting member would constitute the lowest floor. 
    Maintain or maintenance: To keep in an acceptable state of performance and repair as determined by the City Engineer. The City Engineer shall determine if the performance standards of the respective water management plans are maintained. 
    Master stormwater management plan or master plan: An engineering plan, written report, or engineering drawing outlining the primary and secondary drainage and stormwater treatment facilities needed for the proper development of a specific increment of the incorporated area of the City of Casselberry. 
    National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD): As corrected in 1929, is a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    Off-line: The storage of a specified portion of the stormwater in such a manner so that subsequent runoff in excess of the specified volume of stormwater does not flow into the area storing the initial stormwater. 
    Online: The storage of a specified portion of the stormwater in such a manner so that subsequent runoff in excess of the specified volume of stormwater does flow into the area storing the initial stormwater. 
    Regulatory flood: The 100-year flood. The 100-year flood is that flood which has a one percent probability of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, as indicated on the official City of Casselberry flood hazard map. 
    Retention or to retain: The prevention of, or to prevent the discharge of, a given volume of stormwater runoff into surface waters of the state by complete onsite storage where the capacity to store the given volume of stormwater is again provided within 72 hours following the storm event. The required storage volume must be provided by a decrease of stored water caused by percolation through soil, evaporation, evapotranspiration, or spray irrigation. Retention shall be "off-line" (i.e., outside of the primary drainage path), unless it is demonstrated by the applicant that water quality in the receiving waters will not be adversely impacted by "online" retention. 
    Retention/detention (dry): Refers to a retention or detention area, an area where the lowest elevation lies at least two feet above the wet season groundwater table. 
    Retention/detention (wet): Refers to a retention or detention area, the lowest elevation of which penetrates the dry season groundwater table. 
    Sediment: Fine particulate material which is capable of gravity settlement, whether mineral or organic, and which is in suspension or has settled in a water body. 
    Stormwater and flood management system: A system of natural or artificial water bodies or watercourses which stores, conveys and/or treats water. The system generally includes a dam, impoundment, reservoir, inlet, pipe, swale, ditch, appurtenant work or works, or a combination thereof, that is intended to provide drainage, water storage conveyance, prevent or impair inundation, or other water management capabilities in and for a discrete area or a work that traverses waters in the City of Casselberry. A system may be designed and constructed in phases. 
    Water: All water above, on, or beneath the surface of the ground including natural or artificial watercourses, lakes, ponds, or diffused surface water and water standing, percolating or flowing beneath the surface of the ground within the City of Casselberry. 
    Water body: Any natural or artificial pond, lake, reservoir or other area which ordinarily or intermittently contains water and which has a discernible shoreline. 
    Watercourse: Any natural or artificial channel, ditch, canal, stream, river, creek, waterway or wetland which flows either continuously or intermittently, and which has a definite channel, bed, banks or other discernible boundary. 
    Watershed: A drainage area or drainage basin contributing to the flow of water directly or indirectly into receiving waters. 
    Wetland: Wetlands shall be defined based on hydrology as well as hydric soil and wetland vegetation. Wetlands shall include those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do, or would support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Flora and fauna species which shall be protected by the regulations of Section 3-11.7 are listed in Official Lists of Endangered and Potentially Endangered Fauna and Flora in Florida, Florida Game and Freshwater Fish Commission, latest edition and as hereafter may be amended. Wetland boundaries shall be made in accordance with the requirements of the FDER, SJRWMD, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and shall include the largest or most inclusive area whether isolated or contiguous with a natural or artificial water body. 
Section 3-12.3. - Standards and requirements. 
    The following general criteria shall be applicable to all stormwater management plans as approved by the City Engineer: 
A.  Rules of construction. These requirements are intended to complement regulations of the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation (FDER) including but not limited to those found in the Florida Administrative Code, chapter 17-25, Regulation of Stormwater Discharge, and the Stormwater Rules of the St. Johns River Water Management District, all as adopted or as may be amended from time to time. Approval of a stormwater management system under these requirements shall not relieve any applicant of the necessity to obtain required permits or approvals from other state, regional or local agencies, including specifically, but not limited to, observance of DER permitting requirements for the use of the "landward extent of waters of the state," as defined in the Florida Administrative Code, Section 17-4.02(17). In the event of a conflict between the City regulations and state regulations, the more restrictive regulations shall prevail. 
B.  Nonstructural methods. When possible, the nonstructural approach shall be used to meet both surface water quantity and quality requirements. 
C.  Stand-alone systems. The drainage system for each phase of a development shall be capable of standing on its own if subsequent areas planned for development are not developed. 
D.  Accommodating existing runoff. Permitted rates and volumes of stormwater runoff, whether discharged into natural or artificial watercourses, shall meet existing water quality standards at the first downstream receiving water body for which such standards have been established. 
E.  Innovative techniques. The general criteria, as outlined herein, shall in no way be construed as prohibiting new and innovative techniques. 
1.  All such new and innovative techniques shall be subject to the approval of the City Engineer at a pre-design conference prior to their use in the design of any development. 
2.  Storm drainage information shall include adequate data to show that the surface runoff from the project during construction, as well as thereafter, shall be controlled in a manner so as not to degrade, either directly or indirectly, bodies of receiving water from the standpoint of their classification and use. Types of data necessary shall include information relating to: 
a.  Water quality. 
b.  Water quantity. 
c.  Frequency characteristics of the runoff. 
d.  Control structures. 
e.  Treatment techniques. 
f.  Effects on the quality and use of the receiving bodies of water. 
F.  Maintain predevelopment conditions. The storage and controlled release or retention onsite, and the infiltration into the ground, of excess stormwater runoff from any commercial, industrial, and residential developments will be required so that neither runoff rate nor volume therefrom will be greater than it was prior to development. 
G.  The effects of soil on stormwater runoff disposal. The procedure for disposing of excess stormwater runoff shall be dependent on the hydrologic soil classifications of the soils within the proposed development boundaries. The hydrologic soil classification shall be as used and defined by the Soil Conservation Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (A, B, C, or D, and A/D, B/D, and C/D) in the publication, Seminole County, Florida-Soils, and in other publications of the Soil Conservation Service. However, the location and designation of the various soil types as depicted therein shall be fully substantiated by a soils analysis, if required by the City Engineer. 
H.  Natural drainageways and watercourses. Should the proposed development area contain an existing natural watercourse drainageway, channel, or the like, the natural watercourse and the vegetation inherent therewith shall be maintained and the proposed development designed so as to preserve them. However, the use of the natural watercourse to carry off runoff, after treatment, from any development may be permitted if provision for control of sediment in the excess runoff is made prior to entrance of the runoff to the natural watercourse. This does not preclude the use of isolated wetlands for storage and treatment of stormwater runoff as long as the integrity of the wetland is not degraded. 
I.  Upstream runoff. The drainage system for each development shall be sized to accommodate existing upstream runoff. 
J.  Effect of development on environmentally sensitive lands. No site alteration shall cause siltation of wetlands, pollution of wetlands, or reduce the natural retention or filtering capabilities of wetlands. 
K.  Avoiding potential health hazards. No site alteration shall allow water to become a health hazard. 
L.  Provide necessary facilities. All site alteration activities shall provide for such water-retention and settling structures and flow-attenuation devices as may be approved by the City Engineer to ensure that the foregoing standards and requirements are met. 
M.  Maintain existing surface drainage. Site alteration shall not adversely affect existing surface water flow pattern. To the extent feasible, drainage subbasin boundaries shall be maintained. 
N.  Maximize recharge. The parcel shall be developed to maximize the amount of natural rainfall which is infiltrated into the soil and to minimize direct overland runoff into adjoining streets and watercourses. Stormwater runoff from roofs and other impervious surfaces shall be diverted into swales or terraces on the lot when possible. 
O.  Overland flow. To the extent feasible runoff from impervious areas shall be diverted so as to flow over vegetated areas prior to flowing into gutters, storm drains and retention areas. 
P.  Waterfront development. Waterfront properties which drain directly into adjacent water bodies shall utilize pre-berms, terracing, swales, and natural vegetative buffers to divert, detain, and/or filter stormwater before it enters the receiving water body in an effort to preserve the aquatic environment therein. 
Q.  Preservation of native vegetation. In no case shall reduction of the groundwater occur so as to disturb natural vegetation on- or offsite. 
Section 3-12.4. - General conditions for drainage easements. 
    Easements shall be provided for the installation of, access to and/or maintenance of public utilities and drainage systems and other publicly owned or maintained improvements and facilities that are not located within public street rights-of-way or upon land otherwise owned, controlled or legally accessible by the responsible public entity. The City Engineer shall have the authority to increase the minimum required width of drainage easements when deemed necessary to provide for proper access, maintenance and/or functioning of the drainage system. Furthermore, easements shall be required when necessary for the functioning of the affected system, facility or improvement. 
A.  Review and approval. Easements for all facilities must be shown on construction drawings and approved by the City Engineer. The easements and rights-of-way must be executed, accepted by the City Commission, and recorded in the public records prior to issuance of construction permit. The relationship between the type of drainage system and the minimum width of the easement shall be as follows: 
Drainage System Minimum 
Easement Width Closed drainage systems 30 feet Open drainage systems 30 feet  
B.  Subdivisions. Easements which are required within a platted subdivisions shall be clearly identified on the face of the plat and included in the dedication. 
C.  Prohibited easements. Easements shall not be established, conveyed, dedicated or otherwise utilized for the purpose of providing access to lots, tracts or parcels established after the effective date of this Code. However, the City Engineer shall have the authority to require the developer to provide access easements to a lot or tract or record when such an access easements is necessary to provide legal access to such lot or tract. 
D.  Offsite. Easements shall be required when access to, maintenance of and/or utilization of offsite improvements is necessary and not otherwise provided to ensure the proper functioning of the affected improvement. 
Section 3-12.5. - Open storm drainage systems and outfall ditches. 
    Open drainage systems are considered to be grassed swales, ditches and canals. This Section applies to all such open drainage systems except roadside swales. Drainage facilities shall be designed for rainstorms of the intensities shown in the FDOT Drainage Permit Manual for ten-year return periods based on time of concentration.

1.  Minimum of a three-foot cover from the design grade of the waterway. 
2.  Utilities shall be adequately marked to protect against accidental damage during maintenance operations. 
3.  No aerial supports shall be allowed in the confines of the waterway. 
4.  All sleeves or crossings shall meet the minimum standards and specifications according to the FDOT utility accommodations guidelines. 
Section 3-12.6. - Roadway drainage design and performance standards. 
A.  All roads. All roadways shall be designed in accordance with the following standards: 
1.  Cross-slope. All roadways shall be designed using a standard crown section (runoff directed from the centerline toward the edge of pavement). Super elevated curves may direct runoff across all travel lanes. The minimum allowable cross-slope for all streets shall be one-fourth inch per foot. 
2.  Minimum groundwater and high water clearances. All streets shall be designed to provide a minimum clearance of one foot between the bottom of the base and the estimated seasonal high water table, to the artificial water table induced by an underdrain or exfiltration system. 
3.  Roadway underdrains. If underdrains systems are used, their flow contributions shall be incorporated in the design of the stormwater management system. Reference Section 3-12.14, Roadway Underdrains, for detailed performance criteria for the construction and operation of roadway underdrains. 
B.  Rural sections. Rural sections shall comply with the following standards: 
1.  Post-storm capacity. Provide the capacity for the given volume of stormwater within 72 hours following the storm event assuming average antecedent conditions.

C.  Urban sections. All urban section roadways shall comply with the following standards: 
1.  Curb, gutter and grades. All urban section roadways shall be designed using either Miami curb and gutter or standard curb and gutter. The minimum allowable centerline grade for all streets with curb and gutter shall be 0.30 percent, except in intersections where flatter grades shall be allowable. 
2.  Allowable length of gutter flow. Unless the design requires shorter distance, the maximum distance in which surface water will be allowed to run in the gutter shall be as follows: 
Miami curb and gutter   600 feet Standard curb and gutter 1,200 feet  
3.  Inlet interception rates. All inlets shall be spaced in such a manner that 100 percent of the approaching gutter flow shall be intercepted. However, the actual required spacing will depend on the characteristics of the particular site and the flow quantities to be handled. 
4.  Low-point inlets. On arterial and collector roadways, in order to prevent siltation and to provide for a safety factor against clogging at a low point, it is required to construct multiple inlets at all low points. Preferably three inlets should be constructed on each side of the roadway, one at a low point and one each side of a point 0.2 feet higher than the low point. On all other roadways, inlets at low points shall be designed with a super-standard intake opening. 
5.  Inlets. For maintenance purposes, all curb inlets shall be designed for heavy traffic loads. Said inlets shall not be constructed within the radii of curb returns. 
a.  Inlets shall be placed at all points where the cross-slope on a roadway reverses from a negative to a positive to prevent stormwater from crossing the roadway. 
b.  Wherever possible, curb inlets shall be placed in front of lot lines. 
c.  No stormwater runoff will be allowed to enter the roadway gutter from areas outside of the roadway limits. Offsite flows from directly connected impervious areas more than 0.5 acre shall be intercepted prior to right-of-way line. 
d.  Inlet grates shall be designed to minimize clogging with debris such as leaves. 
e.  The top elevations of all inlets shall be flush with contiguous sidewalks. Slopes between inlet tops and sidewalks shall be one-fourth inch per one foot as a maximum.

    Where utility lines pass through manholes, the utility shall be placed in such a manner as to provide a minimum of 1.0 foot clearance between the bottom of the manhole and the bottom of the shell of the utility pipe. 
    Conflict manholes shall be oversized to accommodate the decreased maneuverability inside the structure and flow retardance. 
G.  Storm sewer alignment. All storm sewer layouts shall avoid abrupt changes in direction of slope and shall maintain reasonable consistencies in flow velocity unless specially designed and accounted for in head loss calculation. 
    All storm sewer systems shall maintain a reasonable slope through all manholes. Manholes shall be required wherever there is a change in pipe size, material, slope or vertical or horizontal alignment.

Section 3-12.10. - Retention facilities. 
    Retention systems are designed to prevent the discharge of a given volume of stormwater runoff into surface waters in the state by complete onsite storage. Examples may include excavated or natural depression storage areas, pervious pavement with subgrade, or aboveground storage areas. 
    Retention systems shall comply with the following requirements: 
A.  Dedicated retention pond plat. Retention ponds within platted subdivisions shall not be dedicated or conveyed in the form of an easement but rather shall be platted as a separate tract of land dedicated to the entity responsible for maintenance. 
B.  Redeveloped sites. Alterations, expansions and activities which do not cause an increase or net decrease in impervious area shall be required to comply only with Paragraph D., immediately below, of this Section. 
C.  Post-storm capacity. Unless retention ponds are approved as a water feature or other similar special facility, such retention facilities shall be designed to ensure dry bottom within 72 hours after the design storm event. Dry bottom shall mean the absence of standing water. The storage volume must be provided by a decrease of stored water caused only by percolation through soil, evaporation or evapotranspiration. 
Retention basins shall have sufficient storage so as to contain the increased runoff after development, based upon the 25-year frequency, 24-hour design rainfall, with a minimum freeboard of one foot, considering that infiltration out of the basin through the side and bottom is occurring during these storms. Minor flooding of the area and streets in the vicinity of the retention basin during the theoretical 100-year frequency, 24-hour design rainfall will be permitted. 
D.  Retention of first half-inch runoff. Provide for either of the following: 
1.  Off-line retention of the first one-half inch of runoff or 1.25 inches of runoff from the impervious area, whichever is greater; or 
2.  Online retention of an additional one-half inch of runoff over that volume specified in Subparagraph (1) above. 
E.  Peak discharge. The peak discharge resulting from a 25-year frequency, 24-hour design runoff, as computed for the developed or redeveloped area, shall not exceed the peak discharge resulting from a 25-year frequency, 24-hour design runoff for existing conditions in the area. In other words, retention ponds shall be designed to retain the difference in runoff volume between pre- and post-development or the pollution abatement volume, whichever is greater. 
F.  Discharge to Outstanding Florida Waters. Retention systems which direct discharge to Class I, Class II, or Outstanding Florida Waters shall provide either of the following: 
1.  At least an additional 50 percent of the applicable treatment volume specified in Subparagraph D.2., above. Off-line retention must be provided for at least the first one-half inch of runoff or 1.25 inches of runoff from the impervious area, whichever is greater, of the total amount of runoff required to be treated; or

6.  Bottom dimension. Minimum bottom dimension shall be four feet in width. 
7.  Structure requirements. All pipes entering or leaving the retention/detention ponds shall have a permanent end treatment (i.e., headwall, mitered collar, energy dissipator, control structure, etc.). 
8.  Outfall structures. An outfall structure will normally be required for retention systems except where deemed unnecessary by the City Engineer. The location of the structure and the shape of the pond shall be designed such that no "short-circuiting" of the flow occurs and that maximum disposition of suspended solids is achieved. In all cases, retention facilities shall be designed considering the event of a possible overflow. A path for such overflow shall be determined and structures in the development so situated that no flood damage shall occur either onsite or offsite. 
When the outfall structure employs a weir within an inlet to control the water surface (diversion box), the structure shall be oversized and provide an access manhole or grate on either side of the weir. 
Outfall structures shall be designed to prevent floating materials and oils from being discharged into the receiving waters. 
9.  Outflow hydrograph. The outflow hydrograph, as computed for the developed or redeveloped area, shall approximate the hydrograph of conditions existing before development or redevelopment prior to its entrance into any watercourse outside the developed or redeveloped area. In addition, the existing shape, timing, and effect of the outflow hydrographs on downstream flow shall be maintained as much as possible. Runoff rates and volumes resulting from the development, in excess of existing amounts, shall be accommodated in an approved manner on site. 
10.  Design without positive outfall. Developments without a positive outfall for discharge shall retain all runoff resulting from the design storm as computed for the developed condition.

The retention areas shall percolate stored water within 72 hours of the end of the design rainfall event. If the percolation test indicates bottom maintenance is required, it shall be performed by exercising the following procedure: 
1.  Remove four to six inches of retention area bottom material and scarify excavated bottom. 
2.  Replace excavated material with clean sand material to design grade and seed and mulch per original design.

The location of the structure and the shape of the pond shall be designed such that no "short-circuiting" of the flow occurs and that maximum disposition of suspended solids is achieved. 
When the outfall structure employs a weir within an inlet to control the water surface (diversion box), the structure shall be oversized and provide an access manhole or grate on either side of the weir. Outfall structures shall be designed to prevent floating materials and oils from being discharged into the receiving waters. Unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer, outfall structures shall be as simple as possible and shall employ fixed control elevations (i.e., no valves, removable weirs, pumps, etc.). 
The outfall structure shall be required to limit peak offsite discharges to predevelopment rates. The structure shall be the discharge point for the filtration system. 
Detention ponds shall be designed so that the outfall structures shall bleed down 50 percent of the stormwater volume specified in Paragraph A., immediately above, within 48 to 60 hours following a storm event, but no more than one-half of this volume will be discharged within the first 48 hours. 
E.  Design without positive outfall. Developments without a positive outfall for discharge shall retain all runoff resulting from the design storm as computed for the developed condition. 
F.  Detention with filtration. Detention with filtration ponds shall be designed to attenuate peak outflows to predevelopment rates and to provide filtration for the pollution abatement volume. 
G.  Permanent pool. Contain a permanent pool of water sized to provide an average residence time of at least 14 days during the wet season (June-October). 
H.  Littoral zone. Provide a littoral zone to be designed as follows: 
1.  The littoral zone shall be gently sloped (six to one or flatter). At least 30 percent of the wet detention system surface area shall consist of a littoral zone. The percentage of littoral zone is based on the ratio of vegetated littoral zone to surface area of the ponds at the control elevation. 
2.  The treatment volume should not cause the pond level to rise more than 18 inches above the control elevation unless the applicant affirmatively demonstrates that the littoral zone vegetation can survive at greater depths. 
3.  Eighty percent coverage of the littoral zone by native non-nuisance aquatic and wetland plants is required within the first 24 months of completion of the system or as specified by permit conditions. Should it be necessary to establish or replenish shoreline vegetation or littoral zones, the developer should consult Appendix A (following Article XI), Aquatic Plants Suitable for Establishment of Littoral Zones and Shoreline Restoration, an excerpt from Aquascaping: Planting and Maintenance, Circular 912 published by IFAS. This appendix will provide a list of suitable water-oriented plants for varying site conditions as well as nondesirable plants.

Be designed so that the mean depth of the permanent pool is between two and eight feet and the maximum depth does not exceed 12 feet below the invert of the bleed-down device, unless the applicant affirmatively demonstrates that alternative depths will not inhibit the physical, chemical, and biological treatment processes or cause the resuspension of pollutants into the water column due to anaerobic conditions in the bottom sediments and water. 
J.  Pool configuration. The shape of all detention basins shall be such that no short-circuiting of flow occurs and so that maximum disposition of suspended solids is achieved in the basin. Dredging of the settled sediments will be carried out when necessary so that the capacity of the basin is not reduced below that for which it is designed. 
K.  Flow paths. Be designed so the flow path through the pond has an average length to width ratio of at least two to one. The alignment and location of inlets and outlets should be designed to maximize flow paths in the pond. If short flow paths are unavoidable, the effective flow path should be increased by adding diversion barriers such as islands, peninsulas, or baffles to the pond. Inlet structures shall be designed to dissipate the energy of water entering the pond. 
L.  Bleed-down devices. Be designed so that bleed-down devices incorporating dimensions smaller than three inches minimum width or less than 20 degrees for "V" notches shall include a device to eliminate clogging. Examples include baffles, grates, and pipe elbows.

If the structure is proposed to be set below this elevation, groundwater inflow must be considered in the drawdown calculations, calculation of average residence time, estimated normal water level in the pond, and pollution removal efficiency of the system. Proposed peak discharge resulting from the design storm for the parcel shall not exceed predevelopment peak discharge for the parcel in question. 
N.  Access. Provide for permanent maintenance easements or other acceptable legal instruments to allow for access to and maintenance of the system, including the pond, littoral zone, inlets, and outlets. The easement or other acceptable instrument must cover the entire littoral zone. 
O.  Additional construction requirements. Retention facilities shall comply with the following:

2.  Filter material should have a uniformity coefficient of 1.5 or greater but not more than 4.0; and 
3.  Filter material should have an effective grain size of 0.20 to 0.55 millimeter in diameter. These criteria are not intended to preclude the use of multilayered filters nor the use of materials to increase ion exchange, precipitation or the pollutant absorption capacity of the filter. 
D.  Maintenance and inspection. Include, at a minimum, capped and sealed inspection and cleanout ports which extend to the surface of the ground at the following locations for each drainage pipe: 
1.  The terminus; and

Examples of how to apply this factor for the specific site conditions include but are not limited to the following: 
1.  Reducing the design percolation rate by half; 
2.  Doubling the length of the filtration system; or 
3.  Designing for the required drawdown within 36 hours instead of 72 hours. 
G.  Invert elevation of the perforated pipe. Be designed so that invert elevation of the perforated pipe is above the seasonal high groundwater table elevation. If the pipe is proposed to be set below this elevation, the pipe should be separated by structural means from the hydraulic contribution of the surrounding water table or groundwater inflow must be considered in the drawdown calculations. 
H.  Additional construction requirements. Detention with filtration facilities shall comply with the following construction requirements: 
1.  Outfall criteria. Detention with filtration ponds shall be required to have an outfall structure, except where deemed unnecessary by the City Engineer. The location of the structure and the shape of the pond shall be designed such that no "short-circuiting" of the flow occurs and that maximum disposition of suspended solids is achieved. 
When the outfall structure employs a weir within an inlet to control the water surface (diversion box), the structure shall be oversized and provide an access manhole or grate on either side of the weir. Outfall structures shall be designed to prevent floating materials and oils from being discharged into the receiving waters. Unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer, outfall structures shall be as simple as possible and shall employ fixed control elevations (i.e., no valves, removable weirs, pumps, etc.). 
The outfall structure shall be required to limit peak offsite discharges to predevelopment rates. The structure shall be the discharge point for the filtration system. 
Detention with filtration ponds shall be designed to attenuate peak outflows to predevelopment rates and to provide filtration for the pollution abatement volume. 
2.  Maintenance berms. Adequate maintenance berms shall be provided and shall be a minimum of 20 feet in width for ponds with fencing and a minimum of 15 feet in width for ponds without fencing.

In areas where the soils have been classified under the SCS Hydrologic Soils Classification System as Types C and D (impervious), or A/D, B/D, and C/D (high groundwater table areas), the overall stormwater management system shall be that of providing detention basins to attenuate peak discharge from the contributory drainage area and to settle solids washed off or eroded therefrom. 
Section 3-12.13. - Underground exfiltration trench systems. 
    Underground exfiltration system is the belowground system consisting of a conduit such as perforated pipe surrounded by natural or artificial aggregate which is utilized to percolate stormwater into the ground. This technique for stormwater management requires substantial maintenance for optimum effectiveness.

In cases where there is a prevalence of soils that exhibit adverse water table characteristics, underdrains or fill or other acceptable alternatives that will provide necessary measures to maintain the structural integrity of the road will be required. The determination of need shall be made by reference to applicable portions of the most recent edition of the Soil Survey and Supplement for Seminole County, Florida, as prepared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, and Soil Survey Supplement, or whatever subsequent authoritative soil survey may be published for Seminole County after adoption of these regulations, or according to information generated by developers. 
    Wherever roadway construction reveals unexpected water-bearing strata that would cause deterioration of the pavement, underdrains or other acceptable alternatives that will provide necessary measures to maintain the structural integrity of the road will be required even though not shown on the plans. 
C.  Soils with unacceptable water table characteristics. Wherever road construction on a lot development is planned in areas of the proposed subdivision having soil types with unacceptable water table characteristics, underdrains must be designed with free gravity outlets at carefully selected discharge points. Erosion control measures shall be provided as needed at all discharge points. 
D.  Finished grades exceeding degree of limitation.

E.  Filtering media. Filtering media shall consist of stone, gravel, or slag, and shall contain no friable materials. 
F.  Materials specifications. Underground drainage systems materials shall conform to Section 3-12.16. 
Section 3-12.15. - Roadway underdrain design criteria. 
    Roadway underdrain is a drainage system installed adjacent to a roadway to improve the infiltration and percolation characteristics of the natural soil when permeability is restricted due to periodic high water table conditions or the presence of layers of fine-textured soil below the roadway. These systems usually consist of a system of interconnected belowground conduits such as perforated pipe, which simultaneously limit the water table elevation and intercept, collect, and convey stormwater which has percolated though the soil. 
    Natural environmental features in the City of Casselberry primarily associated with soil limitations and high groundwater conditions normally necessitate the provision of underdrains in order to comply with these drainage requirements. As such, the following requirements shall apply to underdrains: 
A.  Runoff. Pollution abatement shall be accomplished by providing for either of the following: 
1.  Off-line storage of the first one-half inch of runoff or 1.25 inches of runoff from the impervious area, whichever is greater; or 
2.  Online storage of an additional one-half inch of runoff over that volume specified in Subparagraph A.1., above. 
Underdrain systems may contain areas of standing water only following a rainfall. 
B.  Post-storm capacity. Provide the capacity for the specified treatment volume of stormwater within 72 hours following a storm event. The storage volume must be provided by a decrease of stored water caused only by percolation through soil with subsequent transport through the underdrain pipes, evaporation or evapotranspiration. 
C.  Safety factor. Be designed with a safety factor of at least two. Examples of how to apply this factor include but are not limited to reducing the design percolation rate by half or designing for the required drawdown within 36 hours instead of 72 hours. 
D.  Groundwater drawdown criteria. Either the water table shall not be lowered more than three feet below the high water table for the parcel, or the water table shall not be lowered more than five feet below the high water table at the location of the underdrain. 
E.  Pond underdrain criteria. Pond underdrains shall be designed to provide a drawdown for detention basins and to provide detention with filtration for purposes of pollution abatement. The design of all pond underdrains shall be approved by the City Engineer. 
F.  Underdrain outlet. All pond underdrains shall be designed such that the tailwater elevation shall not exceed the top of the underdrain outlet pipe. 
G.  Cleanouts. All pond underdrains shall be provided with cleanouts at the ends of each run and at intervals not to exceed 100 feet. 
H.  Maintenance and inspection requirements. All privately maintained pond underdrains must be checked and maintained on an annual basis to insure proper operation. Written confirmation of inspection must be received by the City within 30 days of the inspection. If the underdrain system no longer functions as designed and approved, such underdrains must be removed, replaced or repaired.

Section 3-13.1. - Applicability. 
    This ordinance shall be applicable to all land lying within the incorporated area of the City of Casselberry, Florida. If provisions of this Article conflict with other land development regulations, the more restrictive provisions shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 15-1418, § IV, 4-13-15) 
Section 3-13.2. - Purpose and intent. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of these regulations is to establish minimum standards for the installation and maintenance of landscaping on properties within the City. 
B.  Intent. These regulations have been established to create, enhance, protect and preserve landscaping. Open space and spaces between buildings required by this Article shall provide landscaping which enhances the aesthetics of the site, provides adequate light and air, provides appropriate separation between buildings and uses, creates screening and enhances privacy, provides sufficient area for recreation and leisure pursuits and facilitates surface water drainage. 
(Ord. No. 15-1418, § IV, 4-13-15) 
Section 3-13.3. - General regulations. 
    The following general regulations shall apply to all landscaped areas: 
A.  Florida-friendly landscaping. All developments shall incorporate tolerant, native and noninvasive exotic plants in landscape plans as a water conservation measure. Landscape designs shall incorporate appropriate plant material which will survive and flourish with comparatively little supplemental irrigation. A list of plants which require minimal water can be found in the most up to date version of the "Florida-Friendly Landscaping Guide to Plant Selection & Landscape Design" - University of Florida, Institute of Food & Agricultural Sciences (IFAS). Selection should be based on: 
1.  Appropriate plant selection, location, and arrangement. 
2.  Land clearing standards and preservation of native vegetation. 
3.  Site planning and design. 
4.  Efficient irrigation and water conservation measures. 
5.  Reduction of stormwater run-off. 
6.  Yard waste management. 
7.  Fertilizer and pesticide management. 
8.  Landscape maintenance. 
9.  Shoreline considerations.

C.  Required coverage. All landscape open area, including landscape strips and islands required by this Article, and ground not covered by building, paving, or other structures, shall be covered by a living plant material such as grass, ground cover, shrubs, and other living planted landscaping materials, excepting a mulched area having a radius no larger than three feet from the outside diameter of the fill. 
D.  Structures. Landscaping shall be placed around all structures so as to enhance the appearance of the structure and to screen any unsightly features. 
E.  Grass. Grass areas shall be planted in species normally grown as permanent lawns in the vicinity of the City of Casselberry, Florida. Grass areas shall be sodded. Seed shall only be allowed within retention areas. 
F.  Synthetic or artificial material. Synthetic or artificial material in the form of trees, shrubs, grass, ground covers or vines shall not be used in lieu of plant requirements in this Section. 
G.  Mulches. Organic mulches, e.g. pine and cypress; and inorganic mulches e.g. rock, stone and gravel shall be required in planting beds to a minimum depth of two inches. Mulches will help in holding moisture, cooling the surface, reducing weed growth, slowing erosion, and, in the case of organic mulches, even improve the soil quality as they decompose. 
H.  Open Space. Table 2-5.4, Size and Dimension Regulations, cites the maximum allowable impervious surface ratio within each district. Open space shall be comprised of permeable surfaces, excluding principal structures, parking or paved areas and any other impermeable surfaces. Areas used to filtrate stormwater such as stormwater ponds, rain gardens and swales shall not be counted as open space, except as may be allowed in Section I below. 
I.  Drainage systems. In order to maximize the developable area of a site, innovative designs for landscape areas may be considered by creating rain gardens, bioswales, and/or bioretention areas that emulate natural hydrology. Such systems may be provided within any of the required landscape areas where appropriate design is provided. Appropriate design is a retention/drainage area as well as an improvement to the aesthetics of the site. For wet detention or dry retention pond systems, up to 50 percent may be counted as open space if the pond is natively landscaped in such a manner to emulate a natural wetland or lake system, generally consisting of both significant upland and emergent species. Appropriate maintenance criteria will be imposed to ensure all such systems in this Section are properly maintained in perpetuity. 
J.  Landscape strips. All landscape strips shall be six feet in diameter with concrete curbing along the outer perimeter where they meet a parking area or drive aisle. All landscape strips required by this Article shall be protected from vehicular encroachment by raised curbing. 
K.  Berms, walls and fences. Berms, walls and fences are encouraged to reduce the impacts upon a surrounding land use or roadway. 
1.  Where a berm, wall or a fence is constructed within the required landscape strip, plant requirements for landscape strips may be reduced by 50 percent. 
2.  Berms. 
a.  Berms must be covered with live vegetation and be at least 18 inches in height with a maximum slope of three to one (3:1). The minimum crown of the berm shall be two feet. 
b.  The required height of a berm between land uses for buffering and screening purposes depends upon the surrounding land use (See Tables 3-13.7(C1) and (C2)). 
3.  Fences. When used to buffer or screen, a fence shall be of a solid material and maintain a character and scale appropriate to the neighboring land use.

b.  Good forestry practices, i.e., the number of healthy trees that a given parcel of land will support. 
c.  The extent of any damage or hardship which would result to the applicant from a denial of the requested permit. 
d.  The species and size of the tree/s proposed for removal. 
e.  The following factors shall also be considered: 
i.  Trees forming the current canopy; 
ii.  Preservation of the next generation of trees and 
iii.  The trimming of lower branches. 
D.  Filing application. An application for tree removal shall be filed on official forms provided by the City. Completed applications shall be returned to the Community Development Department, along with the following: 
1.  A tree inventory consisting of a scaled aerial photograph or drawing of a scale of one inch equals 300 feet or greater indicating: 
a.  Property boundaries. 
b.  The location of all individual trees, (other than undesirable trees* and those below six inches caliper) including:

c.  An alternative species may be used where the tree does not form part of a row or cluster of trees which form and create the landscape aesthetics of the site. The replacement tree will be of similar characteristics to the tree removed. 
d.  A tree of less shade or screening potential may be provided where the applicant can show that the site is unable to accommodate a tree of equal shade or screening potential of the tree removed. 
The applicant will be required to show that the tree has been planted in excess of those provided as part of the site plan. 
2.  Property without an approved landscape plan. Tree replacement for sites which do not have an approved landscape plan shall be determined as follows: 
a.  The site shall be reviewed to assess whether it meets the required site tree standards: 
i.  Not fewer than three trees per 6,000 square feet.

i.  Site area, 
ii.  Impervious/ pervious calculations, 
iii.  Number, species, size (caliper) and location of all trees on site (excluding undesirable). 
c.  Credit shall be applied to healthy trees on site as follows: 
Tree size Credit >20" to =29" = 2 trees >30" to =39" = 3 trees >40" to =49" = 4 trees >50" = 5 trees  
d.  Where the site meets tree requirements, replacements trees will not be required. 
e.  Where the site does not meet tree requirements, the size and number of additional trees to be replaced shall be determined based upon the caliper of the tree removed in accordance with the table below. 
Diameter of existing Tree (Inches) Number of Replacement Trees Required for each tree removed Minimum caliper (Inches) Total Replacement Required (Inches) 6-11 1 replaced for 1 removed 3 3 12-17 2 replaced for 1 removed 3 6 18-23 2 replaced for 1 removed 4 8 24-29 3 replaced for 1 removed 4 12 >30 3 replaced for 1 removed 6 18  
f.  All trees removed must be replaced with the number of inches as specified in the column "Total Replacement Required" according to the size of tree removed. 
g.  Where a property has space to provide several trees which will improve the landscaping aesthetics of the site they may provide several trees at three-inch caliper or more based upon staff approval. 
h.  The number of trees permitted and the size of tree required for replacement will depend upon the space available on the property in question. 
i.  Trees shall be planted in locations to not create an impact upon existing structures and tree locations. 
j.  The applicant shall submit: 
i.  A aerial plan that includes: 
a)  Property boundaries;

i.  Fulfillment of required replacement inches or more using the table above; 
ii.  Ability to replace trees on site; 
iii.  Improvement to the aesthetics of the property. 
l.  Where a property provides 75 percent or more trees which provide an equal shade potential to the tree removed, a tree of less shade or screening potential may be provided. 
G.  Tree Bank alternative. 
1.  A Tree Bank fund is established by the City to provide an option to make a fee payment to the City in lieu of providing the required trees on site. Tree requirement covers replacement trees on a site or trees required in accordance with Article XIII-Landscaping. 
2.  The Tree Bank alternative may only be utilized as a last resort after all other design alternatives to provide required landscaping and to preserve and/or replace existing trees have been considered. Property owners must submit an application and a site plan on a form to be provided by the City. 
3.  The applicant must demonstrate that there is insufficient room on the site for required trees due to: 
a.  Existing/proposed trees; 
b.  Existing structures including utility lines; 
c.  Land condition (Topography, soil, etc.); 
d.  Insufficient area for tree to establish; 
4.  A site plan shall be included to demonstrate that there is no room on the site to allow for the mature development of a tree. 
5.  The Administrative Official has the option to accept a cash payment to the Tree Bank in lieu of tree replacement when the Administrative Official finds the applicant has submitted a complete application, and has demonstrated that all design alternatives have been exhausted. 
6.  The payment into the Tree Bank shall be determined by the current wholesale market value published by Central Florida nurseries, plus installation costs to the City, applied to the number of required replacement trees which cannot be reasonably accommodated on site. The wholesale value will be recalculated and adjusted annually on October 1st. The payment shall be calculated by dividing the total of the replacement inches that will not be accommodated on-site by three inches (which is the minimum planting caliper) and then multiplying the result by the current wholesale value plus installation costs to the City of a three inch caliper live oak tree (Quercus virginiana). 
7.  The Tree Bank fund is a part of the City of Casselberry general fund but is reserved exclusively for the design, acquisition, installation and maintenance of trees on public property, or in certain circumstances, on private property. Before approving planting trees on private property, the Administrative Official must find that the trees will provide aesthetic benefits to many of the same citizens who would have benefitted from the installation of the trees on public property. The private property owner must be willing to sign a tree maintenance agreement with the City. 
(Ord. No. 15-1419, § II, 4-13-15; Ord. No. 18-1483, § 2, 7-23-18) 
Section 3-14.8. - Violations, waivers and appeals. 
A.  Trees which have been removed without a permit and/or have been intentionally damaged or destroyed by the property owner or related party shall be replaced and an associated fine shall be paid in accordance with the table below: 
Diameter of existing Tree (Inches) Number of Replacement Trees Required for each tree removed Minimum Caliper (Inches) Total Replacement Required (Inches) Fine per tree 6-11 2 replaced for 1 removed 3 6 (1) 12-17 3 replaced for 1 removed 4 12 (1) 18-23 4 replaced for 1 removed 4 16 (1) 24-29 5 replaced for 1 removed 6 30 (1) >30 6 replaced for 1 removed 6 36 (1) (I) Fines in addition to replacement fees shall be set by City Commission by Resolution.  
B.  Remedial action. 
1.  Where violations of this Article have occurred, the property owner shall be notified by the City of Casselberry that remedial action is required. Upon such notification, the property owner shall submit to the City a certified check to be held in escrow. The amount of money to be held in escrow by the City shall be equal to the restoration cost of the property to the condition it existed prior to the Code violation. The value associated with restoration shall be determined by the City. The property owner shall also pay an administration fee for staff time; this amount shall be determined by the City Commission by Resolution. The property owner may provide documentation to the City regarding the associated value to restore the property. 
2.  Upon the City's acceptance of the funds held in escrow, the property owner may submit to the Planning and Zoning Commission a restoration plan. The restoration plan may require tree replacement and/or may include payment into the City's Tree Bank. The restoration plan may also include irrigation if required. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall review the restoration plan and determine whether it adequately restores the property to its state prior to the violation of this Article. The applicant presenting the restoration plan has the burden to demonstrate to the Planning and Zoning Commission that the property will be restored to meet the purpose and intent of Article XIV, Tree Protection. The restoration plan shall include a deadline by which the plan must be completed. 
3.  In addition to the procedure noted above, the City may also utilize the Code Enforcement Provisions within the City Code regarding violations to the Article. 
C.  Waivers. 
1.  The Planning and Zoning Commission may grant a waiver to Section 3-14.7(G)(5) where the applicant demonstrates 1) that the literal interpretation of the section will deny the applicant reasonable use of property and 2) where such waiver can be demonstrated to be consistent with the purpose and intent of the tree regulations as stated in Section 3-14.2. By way of example, the preservation of any approved tree over a caliper of 24 inches may be considered as the basis for the granting of a waiver from the literal application of the provisions of Section 3-14.7. The particular use made of the property by the applicant shall not be a legitimate basis for granting a waiver.

ARTICLE XVI. - SIGNS 

Section 3-16.1. - Purpose, intent and scope. 
A.  It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare through reasonable, consistent and non-discriminatory sign standards. The sign regulations in this article are also designed and intended to meet the statutory requirement that this municipality adopt land development regulations that regulate signage, a requirement set forth in Section 163.3202(f), Florida Statutes. The sign regulations in this article are not intended to censor speech or to regulate viewpoints, but instead are intended to regulate the adverse secondary effects of signs. The sign regulations are especially intended to address the secondary effects that may adversely impact aesthetics and safety. The sign regulations are designed to serve substantial governmental interests and, in some cases, compelling governmental interests such as traffic safety and warning signs of threats to bodily injury or death. The City specifically finds that these sign regulations are narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling and substantial government interests of traffic safety and aesthetics, and that there is no other way for the City to further these interests. 
    This article regulates signs, as defined in this Land Development Regulations, which are placed on private property or on property owned by public agencies including the City and over which the City has zoning authority. This article is not intended to extend its regulatory regime to objects that are not traditionally considered signs for purpose of government regulation. 
    The City of Casselberry is primarily a single family residential community within Central Florida. In order to preserve and promote the City as a desirable community in which to live, relax and do business, a pleasing, visually attractive environment is of foremost importance. The regulation of signs within the City is a highly contributive means by which to achieve this desired end. 
    These sign regulations have been prepared with the intent of enhancing the visual environment of the City and promoting its continued well-being, and are intended to: 
1.  Encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication in the City: 
2.  Maintain and enhance the aesthetic environment and the City's ability to attract sources of economic development and growth; 
3.  Improve pedestrian and traffic safety; 
4.  Minimize the possible adverse effect of signs on nearby public and private property: 
5.  Foster the integration of signage with architectural and landscape designs; 
6.  Lessen the visual clutter that may otherwise be caused by the proliferation, improper placement, illumination, animation, excessive height, and excessive size (area) of signs which compete for the attention of pedestrian and vehicular traffic; 
7.  Allow signs that are compatible with their surroundings and aid orientation, while precluding the placement of signs that contribute to sign clutter or that conceal or obstruct adjacent land uses or signs; 
8.  Encourage and allow signs that are appropriate to the zoning district in which they are located; 
9.  Establish sign size in relationship to the scale of the lot and building on which the sign is to be placed or to which it pertains; 
10.  Preclude signs from conflicting with the principal permitted use of the site and adjoining sites; 
11.  Regulate signs in a manner so as to not interfere with, obstruct the vision of or distract motorists, bicyclists or pedestrians; 
12.  Except to the extent expressly preempted by state or federal law, ensure that signs are constructed, installed and maintained in a safe and satisfactory manner, and protect the public from unsafe signs; 
13.  Preserve, conserve, protect, and enhance the aesthetic quality and scenic beauty of all districts of the City; 
14.  Allow for traffic control devices without regulation consistent with national standards and whose purpose is to promote highway safety and efficiency by providing for the orderly movement of road users on streets and highways, and that notify road users of regulations and provide warning and guidance needed for the safe, uniform and efficient operation of all elements of the traffic stream; 
15.  Protect property values by precluding, to the maximum extent possible, sign types that create a nuisance to the occupancy or use of other properties as a result of their size, height, illumination, brightness, or movement; 
16.  Protect property values by ensuring that sign types, as well as the number of signs, are in harmony with buildings, neighborhoods, and conforming signs in the area; 
17.  Regulate the appearance and design of signs in a manner that promotes and enhances the beautification of the City and that complements the natural surroundings in recognition of this City's reliance on its natural surroundings and beautification efforts in retaining economic advantage for its resort community, as well as for its major subdivisions, shopping centers and industrial parks; 
18.  Enable the fair and consistent enforcement of these sign regulations; 
19.  Promote the use of signs that positively contribute to the aesthetics of the community, are appropriate in scale to the surrounding buildings and landscape, and advance the City's goals of quality development; 
20.  Provide standards regarding the non-communicative aspects of signs, which are consistent with city, county, state and federal law; 
21.  Provide flexibility and encourage variety in signage, and create an incentive to relate signage to the basic principles of good design; and 
22.  Assure that the benefits derived from the expenditure of public funds for the improvement and beautification of streets, sidewalks, public parks, public rights-of-way, and other public places and spaces, are protected by exercising reasonable controls over the physical characteristics and structural design of signs. 
B.  Where there is conflict between this article and other sections of this Code, the most restrictive regulations shall apply. 
C.  This article does not regulate government signs on government property, including traffic control devices, since this constitutes government speech for purposes of public safety.

ARTICLE XVII. - NUISANCE ABATEMENT 

Section 3-17.1. - Performance standards for nuisance abatement. 
    The purpose of performance standards for nuisance abatement is to control the impacts of any use, including commercial and industrial uses; to permit potential nuisances to be measured factually and objectively; to ensure that all industries will institute methods to protect the City from hazards and nuisances which can be prevented; and to protect industries from arbitrary exclusion or persecution based upon the nuisance production by any particular type of industry. 
Section 3-17.2. - Application of standards. 
    As of the effective date of this ordinance: 
1.  Any use established or changed, and any buildings, structures or land developed, constructed or used, for any permitted, conditional, or other permissible principal or accessory use shall comply with all of the performance standards herein set forth for the district involved. 
2.  If any existing use or building or other structure is extended, enlarged, moved, structurally altered or reconstructed, the performance standards for the district involved shall apply with respect to such extended, enlarged, moved, structurally altered or reconstructed building or other structure or portion thereof. 
3.  Within one year after the effective date of this regulation, all existing uses, buildings or other structures shall comply with the performance standards herein set forth for the district involved, provided, however, that, if the City Commission finds that, because of the nature of the corrective action required, the one-year period is inadequate, it may, as a special exception, grant not more than one extension for a period not more than 12 months. All new installations shall comply when put into operation. 
Section 3-17.3. - Procedures for enforcement. 
A.  Purpose of procedures. The purpose of the procedures for enforcing performance standards is to ensure that an objective determination is made in those cases where there may be uncertainty as to whether an individual land use or group of land uses complies with the performance standards of this Chapter, and to formulate practical ways for the alleviation of such noncompliance. 
B.  Enforcement procedures. Alleged violations of the performance standards shall be investigated by the Administrative Official and/or other staff as needed. 
1.  Required data. Following the initiation of an investigation, the Administrative Official and/or other designated staff may require the owner or operator of any proposed use to submit such data and evidence as is needed to make any objective determination. The evidence may include, but is not limited to, the following items: 
a.  Plans of the existing or proposed construction and development. 
b.  A description of the existing or proposed machinery, processes and products. 
c.  Specifications for the mechanisms and techniques used or proposed to be used in restricting the possible emission of any of the dangerous and objectionable elements as set forth in this Section. 
d.  Measurements of the amount and rate of emission of said dangerous or objectionable elements. 
Failure to submit data required by the City shall constitute grounds for denial or revocation of an occupancy permit, whichever is appropriate, to meet the intent of this Article. 
2.  Evaluation of proposed land uses. Subsequent to a review of proposed land uses or development plans, the City Administrative Official and/or other designated staff may determine that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the proposed use may violate the performance standards cited herein. In such cases where substantial uncertainty exists as to whether a proposed new land use will comply with the performance standards, the Administrative Official may, at the applicant's expense, request a statement of a professional engineer registered in the State of Florida, which certifies that the planned land use is designed to satisfy the performance standards. Findings of the said engineer shall be presented to the Planning and Zoning Commission for review and evaluation concurrent with site plan review. 
3.  Evaluation of existing development. When the City of Casselberry ascertains a probable noncompliance by an existing land use, the Administrative Official and/or other designated staff with the consent of the Administrative Official shall investigate as follows: 
a.  Where determination can be made by the City staff, using equipment normally available to the City or obtainable without extraordinary expense, such determinations shall be made before notice of violation is issued. 
b.  Where technical complexity or extraordinary expense makes an investigation utilizing City personnel and/or equipment unreasonable, the City Commission may retain an expert consultant to determine if a land use activity is in compliance with performance standards. Such consultants shall be fully qualified to give the required information and shall be persons or firms mutually agreeable to the City of Casselberry and to the owner or operator of the use in question. In the event of inability to select a mutually agreeable consultant, the City and the owner or operator may select independent consultants, in which event each party shall bear its own costs irrespective of the final determination of compliance or noncompliance with the performance standards in question. If one consultant is mutually agreed upon, the cost of the consultant's services shall be borne by the owner or operator of said use, if the use is found to be in violation of the performance standards, but if the use is found by the final authority to be in compliance with the regulations the City shall bear the cost of the consultant's services. 
4.  Action by City. Within 30 days following the receipt of the required evidence, the Administrative Official and/or other designated staff shall make a determination as to compliance or noncompliance with the performance standards. In the event of noncompliance, the Administrative Official may require modifications or alterations in the existing construction or the operational procedures to ensure that compliance with the performance standards will be maintained. The operator shall be given a reasonable length of time to effect any changes prescribed by the Administrative Official for the purpose of securing compliance with the performance standards. If, after the conclusion of the time granted for compliance with the performance standards, the Administrative Official and/or other designated staff finds the violation is still in existence, the matter shall be referred to the Code Enforcement Board. 
Section 3-17.4. - Specific standards for nuisance abatement. 
    All uses in all zoning districts shall conform to the standards of performance described within the provisions below and shall be constructed, maintained and operated in a manner which is not injurious or offensive to the occupation of adjacent premises due to the emission or creation of noise, vibration, smoke, dust or other particulate matter, toxic or noxious waste materials, odors, fire and explosive hazard or glare. 
A.  Processing and storage. All businesses, services, or manufacturing or processing of materials, goods or products shall be conducted within completely enclosed buildings in all zoning districts. Very limited storage may be permitted outdoors upon demonstration of need and subsequent approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission, but shall be effectively screened by a 95 percent or greater opaque wall, fence or planting so that such materials will not be visible from a public way, except in those cases where the Planning and Zoning Commission determines such screening is unreasonable. 
B.  Air pollutants. Air pollutants, including smoke, particulate matter, odor and toxic matter, shall be regulated by the standards cited below: 
1.  Smoke and particulate matter standards. 
a.  Requirements. All uses shall be controlled to prevent the emission or discharge of any smoke or particulate matter, from any source whatever, to a density greater than the density as described as No. 1 on the Ringelmann chart; provided that the following exceptions shall be permitted: smoke, the shade or appearance of which is equal to but no darker than No. 2 on the Ringelmann chart, for a period, or periods, aggregating four minutes in any 30 minutes. 
b.  Method of measurement. For the purpose of grading the density of smoke, the Ringelmann chart, as published and used by the U.S. Bureau of Mines, which is hereby made a part of this Article, shall be the standard. 
c.  Locational requirements for measurement. Smoke and particulate matter will be measured at its point of emission into the atmosphere and/or at the point of discharge from an area of confinement, storage, or display. 
2.  Odor standards. 
a.  Requirements. All uses shall be controlled to prevent the emission of odorous gases or other material in such quantities as to be offensive at the specified points of measurement. 
b.  Method of measurement. A noxious concentration shall be deemed to be the point at which the measurement of the threshold of smell can be achieved. 
c.  Locational requirements for measurement. Noxious odors shall be measured as specified at a point 25 feet from the point of origin. 
3.  Toxic gases, fumes, vapors, and matter. 
a.  Control of toxic substances. All uses shall be controlled to prevent the discharge of any toxic gases or matter in such quantity that may endanger the public health, safety or welfare or cause damage or injury to other people or uses. 
b.  Locational requirement for measurement. Measurement shall be made at point of discharge into the atmosphere. 
C.  Fire and explosive hazards. All operations, activities and uses shall be conducted so as to comply with the performance standards governing fire and explosion hazards prescribed below. Such uses shall comply with the rules and regulations of the National Fire Code published by the National Fire Protection Association as well as Chapter 4A, Rules of the State Fire Marshal, F.A.C. 
1.  Explosive detonable materials. Explosive detonable materials shall include, but not be limited to, all primary explosives, such as lead azide, lead styphnate, fulminates and tetracene; all high explosives such as TNT, RDX, HMX, PETN, and picric acid; propellants and components thereof, such as dry nitrocellulose, black powder, boron hydrides, hydrazine and its derivatives; pyrotechnics and fireworks such as magnesium powder, potassium chlorate and potassium nitrate; blasting explosives, such as dynamite and nitroglycerine; unstable organic compounds, such as acetylides, tetraxoles and ozonides; unstable oxidizing agents, such as perchloric acid, perchlorates and hydrogen perolear fuels, fissionable materials and products, and reactor elements, such as Uranium 235 and Plutonium 239. 
2.  Regulations governing fire hazard solids. The storage or utilization of solid materials which are susceptible to intense burning shall be within spaces having fire-restrictive construction of no less than two hours and protected with an automatic fire extinguishing system. However, such storage or utilization is not permitted unless approved by the City Planning and Zoning Commission after consultation and approval of the Fire Marshal. 
3.  Fire hazard liquids and gases. 
a.  The storage, utilization or manufacture of flammable liquids or gases which produce flammable or explosive vapors shall be permitted only in accordance with this Section, exclusive of the storage of finished products in original sealed containers (60 gallons or less), which shall be unrestricted. 
b.  The total storage capacity of flammable liquids and gases shall be restricted to the capacity expressly permitted by the City Planning and Zoning Commission after consultation with the Fire Marshal. 
D.  Glare and lighting standards. Any lighting elements or structural materials installed on the site shall be prevented from casting or reflecting glare or light beyond the boundaries of the site, as provided in Section 3-10.2.6.

2.  Method of measurement. The displacement of earth caused by vibration shall be measured in inches by an appropriate instrument approved by the City Commission upon recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission. 
3.  Locational requirement for measurement. Vibration shall be measured as specified along the boundaries of the site. 
4.  Permitted vibration transmissions. 
Frequency 
(cycles per 
 second) Maximum Permitted Displacement Along the Abutting Zoning District 
(inches) 0 to 10 0.0008 10 to 20 0.0005 20 to 30 0.0002 30 to 40 0.0002 Over 40 0.0001  
F.  Electromagnetic radiation. 
1.  Requirements. All uses shall be controlled to prevent any intentional source of electromagnetic radiation which does not comply with the current regulations of the Federal Communications Commission regulations regarding such sources of electromagnetic radiation. Further, any operation in compliance with the Federal Communications Commission regulations shall not be permitted if such radiation causes an abnormal degradation in performance of other magnetic receptors of quality and proper design because of proximity, primary field, blanketing, spurious re-radiation, conducted energy in power or telephone systems or harmonic content. 
2.  Method of measurement. For the purposes of determining the level of radiated electromagnetic interference, standard field strength measuring techniques shall be applied. For determining interference transmitted or conducted by power or telephone lines, a suitable turntable peak reading, radio frequency voltmeter shall be used. This instrument shall, by means of appropriate isolation coupling, be alternately connected from line to line and from line to ground during the measurement. 
3.  Determination of electromagnetic interference. The determination of "abnormal degradation in performance," and "of quality and proper design" shall be made in accordance with good engineering practices as defined in the latest principles and standards of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, the Institute of Radio Engineers, and the Radio Manufacturers Association. In case of any conflict between the latest standards and principles of the above groups, precedence in the interpretation shall be in the following order: 
  American Institute of Electrical Engineers; 
  Institute of Radio Engineers; and 
  Radio Manufacturers Association. 
For the purposes of determining the maximum allowable levels of radiated electromagnetic interference and electromagnetic interference transmitted or conducted by power or telephone lines, maximum allowable levels will be adopted by the City Commission upon recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission and qualified electrical engineers. 
G.  Noise. Unnecessary, excessive or offensive noise shall mean any sound or noise in conflict with the criteria, standards or levels set forth in this Chapter for permissible noise. In the absence of specific maximum noise levels, a noise level which exceeds the ambient sound level by five dB(A) or more, when measured at the nearest property line or, in the case of multifamily residential buildings, when measured anywhere in one dwelling unit or from common space in the same building shall be deemed an unnecessary, excessive or offensive noise. 
1.  Regulating noise from buildings, premises or property. No person owning, or in possession or control of any building or premises shall use the same, or rent the same to be used for any business or employment or residential use, or for any purpose or pleasure or recreation, if such use shall, by its nature, be excessive, offensive, or unusually loud and thereby disturb or destroy the peace of the neighborhood in which such building or premises is situated, or be dangerous or detrimental to health. 
2.  Regulating noise from radios, electronic audio equipment and musical instruments. No person shall use, operate or play any radio, phonograph, stereo set, tape player, television set, sound amplifier or other electronic audio device or any musical instrument which produces or reproduces sound, at an excessive or unusually loud volume level so as to disturb the peace, quiet and comfort of the neighborhood in the vicinity. 
3.  Regulating noise from loudspeakers and devices for advertising. No person shall use, operate or play any loudspeaker, sound amplifier or musical instrument which produces or reproduces sound which is cast or emitted upon the public streets and sidewalks for the purposes of commercial advertising or for attracting the attention of the public to any building, structure or place or to the activity which is being carried on thereon. 
4.  Regulating noise from animals. It shall be unlawful to keep or maintain any animal, bird or fowl within residential zones of the City unless the owner thereof shall provide and maintain adequate precautions and sound control techniques to eliminate any excessive, offensive and unnecessary noise. It shall not be a violation of this Section, however, for any animal, bird or fowl to give a sound of danger or warning under particular circumstances reasonably requiring the need for warning. 
5.  Regulating noise from loading, unloading and unpacking. It shall be unlawful for any person engaged in loading, unloading, packing or unpacking or opening crates, boxes or containers, including the loading or unloading of any motor vehicle or truck trailer onto any truck transport or railway car, to create excessive and unnecessary loud noise. 
6.  Regulating noise from permissible time for construction activity. It shall be unlawful for any person to do, perform or engage in any construction work, building, excavating, hoisting, grading, piledriving, pneumatic hammer, demolition, dredging, building alteration or repair work of any nature to any building or structure, or upon any site for same, in the City on weekends and holidays; as well as on workdays between the hours of 7:00 p.m. of one day and 7:00 a.m. of the next day if any such activity shall cause noises whose levels result in excess of the limits as stated in Subsection G.9.: Maximum Permitted Sound Levels in Decibels. Any person desiring to engage in the aforesaid activity beyond the stated hours of limitation, based upon cases of urgent necessity or upon the interests of public health, safety and ultimate convenience, may apply to the City Planning and Zoning Commission for a special permit. Such permits, if granted, shall be limited to a certain period, but may be renewed for additional periods if the emergency or need therefor continues. In the issuance of such permits the City Planning and Zoning Commission should weigh all facts and circumstances and should determine whether the reasons given for the urgent necessity are valid and reasonable, whether the public health, safety and ultimate convenience will be protected or better served by granting the permit requested and whether the manner and amount of loss or inconvenience to the party in interest imposes a significant hardship. Upon an affirmative finding of the foregoing considerations, the City Planning and Zoning Commission shall issue the permit requested and any extensions thereof, as may be required. During such periods of emergency activities and during the normal construction hours of 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, the noise levels generated by construction activities shall not exceed 75 dB(A) for more than ten percent of the time when measured at a distance of 50 feet from the construction site. 
7.  Regulating noise from fixed mechanical equipment. It shall be unlawful to create any excessive and unnecessary loud noise in excess of the limits described in Subsection 3-17.4(G)9.: Maximum Permitted Sound Decibels, by the use or operation of any fixed mechanical equipment, including but not limited to an air conditioner, compressor unit, power fan or blower or the electric motor or any engine used to drive such device, and such noise shall be muffled and deadened by adequate noise suppression and muffling devices to eliminate annoyance and disturbance to persons within the range of hearing as set forth in this Chapter. 
The Administrative Official or other designated staff shall require compliance with all reasonable sound abatement measures and sound screening which may be necessary to prevent all existing and new fixed mechanical equipment from creating excessive, unnecessary or offensive noise. All new air conditioning equipment hereafter installed in the City shall carry the manufacturer's certification of the sound rating, as determined by the applicable standards of the Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute or the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Engineers. If the sound rating value of an air conditioning unit is such that the sound level created by its operation is in conflict with the provisions of Subsection 3-17.4(G)9., Maximum Permitted Sound Decibels, adequate noise suppression and muffling devices shall be provided to reduce noise level to within the allowable limits. All pertinent information and data as to the sound ratings of such equipment shall be furnished to the Administrative Official or other designated staff at the time the application for the building permit is made. 
8.  Noise measurement procedures. For the purposes of determining and classifying any noise as excessive, offensive and unnecessary or as an unusually loud noise, which is hereby declared to be unlawful and prohibited by this Chapter, the following test measurements, requirements and provisions shall be applied. Notwithstanding, a violation of this Article may occur without the occasion of the measurements being made as hereinafter provided if circumstances are such that a violation would be obvious to an ordinary, reasonable, prudent person. 
9.  Noise control measurement standards. The table entitled "Maximum Permitted Sound Levels in Decibels (dB(A))" herein establishes the maximum permissible noise thresholds. Measurements shall be taken at the boundary lines of the zoning lot in all districts. As indicated, the maximum permissible noise levels vary according to the zoning of the lot adjacent to the lot on which the use is located.

a.  Definition of terms. A decibel is a measure of a unit of sound pressure. Sound waves having the same decibel level "sound" louder or softer to the human ear depending upon the frequency of the sound wave in cycles per second (i.e., whether the pitch of the sound is high or low). Thus, an A-weighted filter, constructed in accordance with the specifications of the American National Standards Institute, which automatically takes account of the varying effect on the human ear of different pitches, shall be used on any sound level measurements required by this Section. Accordingly, all measurements are expressed in dB(A) to reflect the use of this A-weighted filter. 
b.  Method of calculation. The standards cited below are established in terms of the "Equivalent Sound Level (Leq)" which must be calculated by taking 100 instantaneous A-weighted sound levels at ten-second intervals and computing the Leq in accordance with standard ANSI procedures. 
Examples of noise sources having various sound levels are as follows: 
Sound 
 Level 
(dB(A))    Noise Source 40-50 Quiet home 50-60 Window air conditioner 
Large transformer 70-80 Vacuum cleaner

Chapter IV - SPECIFIC DEVELOPMENT PROCEDURES 
ARTICLE XVIII. - SITE PLAN REVIEW 

Section 4-18.1. - Intent of site plan review. 
    The intent of site plan review is to set forth uniform procedures, well-defined application processes and information requirements that ensure that development of individual sites within the City of Casselberry is consistent with all applicable development standards, that the approval of such development will be based upon the provision and availability of adequate public facilities and services coincident with the impact of the development and that the development is compatible and coordinated with existing and anticipated development within the immediate area surrounding the site. 
Section 4-18.2. - Applicability and filing procedure. 
    Site plan approval, as provided for herein, shall be required for each of the following: 
1.  All permitted uses, except single-family and duplex homes and accessory structures thereto. However, all uses and structures shall comply with stormwater management criteria of Article XII. 
2.  All conditional uses. 
3.  Any use or change in use resulting in 1,000 square feet of impervious surface area on the entire site. 
4.  The provisions of Article XII, Stormwater Management, shall apply to all site plans. 
A.  General site plan review procedure. In all cases requiring site plan review, no structure or parking area, or part thereof, shall be erected or used, or land or water used, or any change of use consummated, nor shall any building permit be issued therefor, unless a site plan for such structure or use shall have been reviewed and approved pursuant to the provisions of this Article. 
1.  Filing. Before a site plan shall be approved, an application for approval shall be filed with the Community Development Department. 
2.  Application, fee and disclosure of ownership. Such application shall be in a form substantially in accordance with the form prescribed by the City, copies of which may be obtained from the Community Development Department. Where applicable, a written power of attorney authorizing a person other than the owner(s) to sign such application must be attached to said application. 
All applications shall include a verified statement showing each and every individual person having a legal and/or equitable ownership interest in the property upon which the application for site plan approval is sought, except publicly held corporations, in which case the name and address of the corporation and principal executive officers will be sufficient. 
The fee schedule for site plan review shall be as determined by resolution of the City Commission. 
3.  Review by City Development Review Committee (DRC). The application shall be reviewed by the Development Review Committee (DRC) (reference Section 1-2.4). The DRC shall review each application and ensure compliance with all applicable land development regulations including, but not limited to, performance criteria in Chapter III and other local, state, and/or federal laws. The application with evaluation shall then be forwarded to the Planning and Zoning Commission for their consideration and action. 
Notwithstanding, residential developments of less than five units and minor nonresidential developments of less than 1,000 square feet gross leasable floor area may be approved by the DRC with the approving signature of the Director of Community Development, the City Engineer, the Fire Marshal and the Planning and Zoning Commission chairperson. The Planning and Zoning Commission chairperson may request a review of such minor small-scale projects by the Planning and Zoning Commission in cases where a site plan issue remains unresolved, and, in the opinion of the chairperson, a public review by the Planning and Zoning Commission would assist in achieving resolution of the issue (ref. Section 4-18.2(B)). Appeals of decisions rendered by the Planning and Zoning Commission shall be filed with the Administrative Official and shall be considered by the City Commission pursuant to procedures identified in Section 1-2.6(E). 
4.  Review and action by the Planning and Zoning Commission. After reviewing a site plan and staff recommendations, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall act to approve, approve with conditions, or disapprove. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall provide written comments documenting any conditions of approval. If the site plan is recommended for disapproval, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall specify in writing the reasons for recommending denial. 
"Development of Community Impact (DCI)," as defined in Section 4-18.2(A)(6), shall be reviewed and acted upon by the City Commission. Therefore, the Planning and Zoning Commission, subsequent to reviewing a "development of community impact" shall forward written recommendations to the City Commission for final action. 
5.  Appeals of final decisions rendered by the Planning and Zoning Commission directed to the City Commission. For appeals procedure cross reference Subsection 1-2.6(E). 
6.  Developments of community impacts reviewed by City Commission.

The City Commission shall render decisions regarding such waivers or modifications based on findings pursuant to criteria cited in 4-19.1(D)(4). In granting such waiver or modification, the City Commission may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards, including requirements in excess of those otherwise required by the land development regulations, which shall become a part of the terms under which the subdivision is approved. 
4.  Criteria for consideration of a waiver or modification. Before any waiver or modification may be granted, the following criteria shall be met: 
a.  General criteria. 
i.  Purpose and intent, Comprehensive Plan. The waiver or modification is consistent with the stated purpose and intent of these regulations and with the Comprehensive Plan. 
ii.  Public interest, adjacent property. The waiver or modification would not have a significant adverse impact on the public interest, or on adjacent property. 
iii.  Not discriminatory. The waiver or modification is not discriminatory, considering similar situations in the general area and in past subdivision regulations. 
b.  Specific standards. No waiver or modification may be granted unless the developer clearly shows the existence of one or more of the following: 
i.  Superior alternatives. The development will provide an alternative which will achieve the purposes of the requirement through clearly superior design, efficiency, or performance. 
ii.  Protection of significant features. The waiver or modification is necessary to preserve or enhance significant existing environmental or cultural features, such as trees, scenic areas, historic sites or public facilities, related to the development site. 
iii.  Deprivation of reasonable use. Strict application of the requirement would effectively deprive the owner of all reasonable use of the land to be subdivided, due to its unusual size, shape, topography, natural conditions, or location provided that: 
(a)  Such effect upon the owner is not outweighed by a valid public purpose in imposing the requirement in this case; and 
(b)  The unusual conditions involved are not the result of actions of the developer or property owner which occurred after the effective date of these regulations. 
iv.  Technical impracticality. Strict application of the requirement would be technically impractical in terms of engineering, design, or construction practices, due to the unusual size, shape, topography, natural conditions or location of the land or due to improved efficiency, performance, safety, or construction practices which will be realized by deferral of the installation of required improvement provided that: 
(a)  The development will provide an alternative adequate to achieve the purposes of the requirement, including security for the current construction cost, adjusted for inflation, of any required improvements which may be deferred; and 
(b)  Any unusual conditions creating the impracticality are not the result of the actions of the developer or property owner which occurred after the effective date of these regulations. 
v.  Regulation has no relationship to the proposed development or its impacts. Where all or any part of the regulation has no relationship to the needs of the development, or to the impact of the development on the public facilities, land use, traffic, or environment of the neighborhood and the general community, due to the location, scale, or type of development involved; provided that any specific waiver or modification requirements set forth in these regulations are met. 
vi.  Planned developments. If the subdivision concerns a planned residential or mixed-use project in a PRD or PMX district and the waiver is inconsistent with an approved conceptual, preliminary, or final development plan for the planned development.

6.  A release from the contractor, engineer, surveyor or any other person or persons performing any service or furnishing any material for the subdivision that they will not file a lien on the subdivision for nonpayment of service or material charges. 
Section 4-19.10. - Time extensions. 
    All required improvements for a project or each phase thereof shall be completed within 18 months from the date of preliminary plat approval. Time extensions for demonstrated good cause may be granted by the City Commission upon the recommendation of the City Engineer. The applicant shall present a written request for extension to the office of the Department of Community Development. Each time extension shall not exceed one year. 
Section 4-19.11. - Acceptance and maintenance of required improvements. 
A.  Workmanship and material agreement. The applicant shall execute an agreement guaranteeing the required improvements against defect in workmanship and materials for one year after acceptance of such improvements by the City Commission. Said agreement shall be submitted to the Department of Community Development along with the completion certificate and project records. 
B.  Procedure for accepting dedications. The dedication of public space, parks, streets, rights-of-way, easements or the like on the plat shall not constitute an acceptance of the dedication by the City. The applicant shall apply to the City for acceptance of required improvements by the City Commission. No dedication shall be accepted by the City until the City Engineer has approved the environmental audit required pursuant to Section 4-19.2(J)(2). The acceptance of the dedication shall be subject to the inspection and approval of the City Engineer or other representative designated by the City Commission. Such acceptance shall occur only upon adoption of resolution by the City Commission which shall accept the subject dedications at such time as all improvements meet or exceed the standards set forth by this ordinance. The applicant's engineer shall furnish to the Department of Community Development in writing a sealed and signed certificate stating that the required improvements have been completed in accordance with the approved plan and comply with this ordinance and all other applicable codes. 
    The City Engineer shall receive notice in adequate time to arrange for inspection prior to the beginning of construction and at appropriate staged intervals thereafter. The City Engineer may require laboratory or field tests as well as staged inspections at the expense of the applicant when appropriate. Any failure of work or materials to conform with the plans and specifications or failure to notify the City in time for indicated inspections shall be cause for the City Commission to reject the facilities. 
C.  Recommendation of City Engineer. The City Engineer upon satisfactory completion, receipt of the applicant's engineer's completion certificate, affidavits from all contractors and others who furnished goods and services for the required improvements acknowledging payment in full therefor, and receipt of the agreement shall certify that the applicant has complied with all of the provisions of this ordinance and shall recommend to the City Commission the acceptance of the dedications and, when applicable, the maintenance of the required improvements. 
D.  Acceptance by the City Commission. Upon recommendations by the City Engineer, the City Commission, by resolution, shall approve the subdivision, the dedications on the plat and the maintenance of responsibilities of the required improvements. 
E.  Applicant's failure to complete required improvements. 
1.  Premature recording of plats (or where applicant fails to complete required improvements). When a plat has been recorded and the applicant fails to complete the required improvements as required by this ordinance, the City Commission shall complete the required improvements under the guarantees provided by the applicant. In such case, the City Commission shall direct the City Engineer and/or the City Attorney to call upon the guarantees to secure satisfactory completion of the required improvements. Legal notice of such action shall be deemed to have been duly served upon posting via certified mail return receipt requested. Upon the completion of construction of the required improvements, the City Engineer shall report to the City Commission and the City Commission shall accept by resolution the dedications and maintenance responsibility as indicated on the plat. In such cases, the remaining guarantees posted by the applicant shall be retained for a period of one year after completion in lieu of the agreement. Any defects occurring during this period shall be repaired using funds remaining in the guarantee. 
2.  In cases where plat has not been recorded. Where an applicant has elected to install the required improvements prior to recording of the plat and fails to complete such improvements within the time limitations of this ordinance, all approvals of the subdivision shall be null and void and the land shall revert to its original state. No reference shall be made to the plat with respect to the sale of lots or issuance of building permits, unless and until the plat has been resubmitted with all of the supplementary material and approvals as herein prescribed have been granted. 
ARTICLE XX. - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT 

Section 4-20.1. - Purpose and intent. 
    Planned unit development districts (i.e., see planned residential district (PRD) and planned mixed-use (PMX) districts) are established to implement provisions of the Comprehensive Plan directed toward conserving open space and natural resources, promoting more effective use of developable uplands with available urban services, and promoting mixed-use development of strategically located large parcels having urban services and direct access to major arterial streets. 
    The planned unit development districts provide a voluntary management framework for coordinating objectives of the development of the community which may be inconsistent with conventional zoning district provisions. The planned unit development districts incorporate a more flexible management structure for negotiating private sector development objectives which reinforce and further public sector goals, objectives and policies for the City's development and resource conservation. 
    The planned unit development districts are intended to: 
1.  Encourage innovative planning to achieve urban infill, commercial revitalization, and natural resource preservation. The planned unit development concept is intended to present developers incentives for accomplishing these objectives by providing significantly more flexibility in the design of future development. The planned unit development option frees developers from most of more rigid size and dimension criteria of Table 2-5.4 in Article V. However, the planned unit development option also is intended to require higher standards and increased amounts of urban design amenities than may be achieved through conventional development. Therefore, the site plan review process shall incorporate opportunities for flexibility and negotiation of development and design alternatives directed toward Comprehensive Plan objectives and these regulatory intents; 
2.  Promote efficient use of land by facilitating more cost-effective and environmentally sensitive site planning; 
3.  Create opportunity for clustered development as directed in the Comprehensive Plan on uplands adjacent to environmentally sensitive lands in order to allow for more efficient use of the uplands while conserving environmentally sensitive lands as open space and preserving private property rights to reasonable use of land; 
4.  Conserve and protect the natural environment including wetlands, natural habitat, drainage corridors, floodprone lands, and other environmentally sensitive lands; and 
5.  Provide for more useable and suitably located open space and recreation facilities and other public and common facilities than would otherwise be provided under conventional land development procedures. 
    Although the planned unit development districts provide opportunities for unique concepts, a planned unit development shall comply with the community character as promoted by the City Commission and shall be designed to limit impacts of the development internally within the confines of the planned unit development through compliance with the regulations established in the Comprehensive Plan and as stipulated in the land development regulations. 
(Ord. No. 09-1294, § 7, 5-11-09) 
Section 4-20.2. - General regulations for planned unit development. 
    The following regulations shall be applied to all planned unit development: 
A.  Unified control. All properties proposed as a planned unit development shall be under unified ownership or control as evidenced by documentation. The documentation shall be reviewed for compliance by the City Attorney. 
B.  Minimum size. A planned unit development shall have a minimum of three gross buildable acres under unified control. 
C.  Conformance with Comprehensive Plan and land development regulations. Each planned unit development submitted shall conform to all provisions of the Comprehensive Plan and all applicable provisions of the land development regulations. Pursuant to the City's Comprehensive Plan the maximum residential density shall be 13 units per acre (ref. Table 2-5.4 in Article V). 
D.  Compliance with subdivision regulations. All planned unit development applications shall be reviewed pursuant to provisions of this Article and must meet all applicable land development regulations. For instance, planned unit developments shall comply with provisions of the subdivision control ordinance. Planned unit development plans submitted under this Article must be in a form which will satisfy the requirements of the subdivision control ordinance for preliminary and final plats. Review time for plats shall conform to provisions of this Article. 
E.  Size and dimension regulations. Within all planned unit developments the location, size, dimensions, and design of yards, building setbacks, points of vehicular access, parking areas, building characteristics, and all other planned site improvements shall: 
1.  Preserve the stability of established neighborhoods and incorporate design techniques which ensure a smooth land use transition wherever departures from established patterns are proposed. Such plans shall include appropriate mitigation measures to avoid potential negative impacts on established development; 
2.  Provide safe and convenient internal vehicular circulation, including access and sufficient area for effective delivery of emergency services such as fire protection; 
3.  Be designed to facilitate safe access to and egress from the front and the rear of all buildings; 
4.  Incorporate convenient, well-landscaped, and designed pedestrian ways and open space systems. 
Size and dimension regulations shall be flexible in order to permit innovative land use, design and resource conservation techniques. However, applicants for planned unit development shall be required to achieve higher than normal performance measures. These measures shall be negotiated through the site plan review process and development shall be consistent with performance criteria cited in Chapter III and subdivision regulations cited in Article XIX. Where planned unit developments are proposed adjacent to established residential developments, the planned unit development shall be internalized and perimeter sites within the planned unit development which abut existing residential development shall be platted and planned in a manner compatible with established residential developments to the greatest reasonable extent. Performance measures such as control of structure type, lot size, bufferyards, landscapes and other site design techniques shall be incorporated into the planned unit development in order to protect established neighborhoods. 
F.  Improvements and urban design amenities incorporated in site plan. In addition to the subdivision requirements of Article XIX, all urban design amenities such as major structural improvements, signage, open space systems, pedestrian walkways, street furniture, and other movement systems shall: 
1.  Be planned to present an overall design theme that reinforces principles of human scale; safe, convenient, and attractive pedestrian movement systems linking people with all activity centers, parking arenas, open space amenities, and other development amenities; 
2.  Incorporate urban design amenities generally exceeding minimum standards of urban design as applied to conventional development. Such urban design amenities may include, but shall not be limited to, open plazas and walkway systems; porous paving materials that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing; and street furniture having a harmonious and unified overall design, including street benches, sidewalk plantings, signage, waste disposal receptacles, and other featured amenities which promote the project's design theme and overall aesthetics; and 
3.  Provide for multi-modal transportation amenities, as appropriate, based on the scale and density/intensity of the proposed development. For example, larger-scale projects shall provide for strategically located sheltered transit stops as appropriate. Where transit service or other large vehicles are provided access to the interior of a site, adequate radii shall be provided for transit and other large-scale vehicles. The specific design of such internal surface and structural transportation improvements shall be consistent with standards of professionally accepted principles and practices and shall be consistent with and responsive to the needs of the vehicle types to be accommodated on the subject site. 
4.  Provide open space and recreational amenities, including nature trails, greenways, public and private parks, and other recreational facilities. Such open space, where feasible, shall provide connections or create opportunities for connections to neighborhood and community systems of open space and/or bikeways. Provision of general visual access and physical access to lakes shall also be encouraged. 
This requirement shall be enforced in order to implement the purpose and intent of the planned unit development. 
G.  Planned unit development requirements continuing. The requirements of Article XX shall be continuing and enforceable against any planned unit development approved pursuant to this Article. The requirements shall run with the land and shall be enforceable regardless of transition in ownership. 
The respective uses shall be allowed only after a finding that the use complies with Section 2-5.3, Land Use By District (including Table 2-5.3), applicable conditional use criteria (ref. Article VI), and all other applicable provisions of the land development regulations. 
(Ord. No. 99-964, § VIII, 10-4-99) 
Section 4-20.3. - Conceptual development plan required for planned unit development zoning. 
A.  General procedures for conceptual development plan submittal and approval. Petitions for a planned unit development [i.e., zoning designation of PRD and planned mixed use (PMX) districts], shall be submitted and processed as a zoning map amendment and in accordance with the following special procedures: 
1.  Preapplication conference. Prior to submitting a formal application for planned unit development, the petitioner is encouraged to confer with the City and any other governmental agencies having jurisdiction or permitting responsibilities impacting the proposed development. The petitioner is further encouraged to submit a tentative land use sketch plan for review at the conference, and to obtain information on any projected plans, programs or other matters that may affect the proposed planned developments. This pre-application conference should address, but not be limited to, such matters as: 
a.  The proposed relationship between the anticipated project and surrounding uses, and the effect of the proposed development on the City of Casselberry Comprehensive Plan goals, objectives, and policies as well as other stated planning and development objectives of the City. The requested zoning [i.e., PRD, and planned mixed use (PMX) districts] must be consistent with the Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map (FLUM) designation for the subject property (ref. Section 2-4.2, including Table 2-4.2). 
b.  The adequacy of existing and proposed streets, utilities, and other public facilities to serve the development. If available concurrency facilities capacity is unavailable or is constrained, the applicant should discuss related issues with staff in order to determine their potential impact on the development (ref. Article IX). 
c.  The nature, design, and appropriateness of the proposed land use arrangement for the size and configuration of property involved. 
2.  Initial filing. Before a planned unit development shall be approved, an application for such approval shall be filed together with the requisite fee at the office of the Community Development Department. Such application shall contain the following materials or data in sufficient quantities for necessary referrals and records: 
a.  Evidence that the subject property has a Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map (FLUM) designation consistent with the planned unit development zoning [i.e., PRD and planned mixed use (PMX) districts], ref. Section 2-4.2, including Table 2-4.2). The applicant may seek a required Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map (FLUM) amendment concurrently with a request for a planned unit development zoning amendment. However, no action on the planned unit development zoning petition shall be binding until the necessary amendment to the Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map (FLUM) is duly approved by the City and the State of Florida. The application requirements for a planned unit development amendment to the Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map (FLUM) shall include submission of a conceptual development plan. The requirements defining the form and content of a conceptual development plan are cited in Section 4-20.3(B). 
b.  The evidence of unified control of the proposed planned development and the associated agreements required herein. 
c.  A proposed conceptual development plan as prescribed in Section 4-20.3(B) herein. 
d.  Such other materials as the petitioner desires to submit in support of the planned unit development zoning. 
e.  Any additional information as may be required by the City to resolve issues associated with a planned unit development proposal. However, the intent is not to require detailed plans. Instead, the intent is to provide concentrated plans addressing issues and criteria identified in Section 4-20.3. 
3.  Fee for planned unit development zoning review. The minimum fee for filing said application shall be established by resolution of the City Commission. 
4.  Ownership requirements for application. A planned unit development application shall be filed in the name of the record owner of the property included in the PUD. However, the application may be filed by an applicant with an equitable interest in the property or by an attorney or agent for the owner. All applications shall include a verified statement showing each and every individual person having a legal equitable and/or beneficial ownership interest in the property upon which the application for site plan approval is sought, except corporations, in which case the name and address of the corporation and principal executive officers will be sufficient. 
All land included for the purpose of development within a planned unit development shall be owned or under the control of the petitioner for such zoning designation, whether that petitioner be an individual, partnership or corporation, or a group of individuals, partnerships or corporations. The petitioner shall present firm evidence of the unified control of the entire area within the proposed planned unit development and shall stipulate that, if the applicant proceeds with the proposed development, the applicant or successor in ownership will: 
a.  Do so in accord with the officially approved final planned unit development plan for the development, and such other conditions or modifications as may be attached to the special exceptions. 
b.  Shall provide at the time of final development review agreements, covenants, contracts, deed restrictions, or sureties acceptable to the City for completion of the undertaking in accordance with the adopted final planned unit development plan, as well as for the continuing operation and maintenance of such areas, functions, and facilities as are not to be provided, operated or maintained at general public expense. 
c.  Bind his development successors in title to any commitments made under a. and b. preceding. 
5.  Review procedures for planned unit development zoning. Each applicant for planned unit development zoning shall submit a conceptual development plan for review by the City. The review process shall be carried out pursuant to Article XX. If the conceptual development plan and planned unit development zoning are approved, the applicant shall submit a site development plan for review by City officials. 
a.  Staff review. The conceptual development plan shall be submitted to the Department of Community Development and shall be reviewed by the Administrative Official. The number of copies to be submitted shall be determined by resolution of the City Commission. 
b.  Criteria for review. The Administrative Official shall present its findings in a written report to the Planning and Zoning Commission. The review shall be accomplished expeditiously in order to prevent undue delay or inconvenience, but shall not be limited to the subdivision ordinance timeframe for review of plats. The review shall address the following criteria: 
i.  Compliance with the City of Casselberry Comprehensive Plan. Whether the planned unit development conceptual development plan is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use Map (FLUM) designation and whether the planned development as proposed is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. The conceptual development plan shall be reviewed based on whether Comprehensive Plan objectives are met which are directed toward achieving mixed-use development, clustered development, and preservation of natural resources and open space. 
ii.  Conformance with applicable ordinances. Whether the planned unit development zoning and conceptual development plan complies with the requirements of all applicable regulations and ordinances of the City of Casselberry. 
iii.  Land use compatibility. Whether the proposal would result in any incompatible land uses, considering the type and location of uses involved. 
iv.  Adequacy of concurrency facilities to accommodate anticipated demand. Whether the proposal would likely result in demands on concurrency facilities (ref. Article IX) exceeding the available capacity of such facilities and services, existing or programmed, including traffic circulation, water and wastewater services, drainage, recreation, and solid waste. 
v.  Natural environment. Whether the proposal would result in significantly adverse impacts on the natural environment. 
vi.  Economic effects. Whether the proposal would adversely affect the property values in the area, or the general welfare. 
vii.  Orderly development. Whether the proposal would result in an orderly and logical development pattern, specifically identifying any negative effects on such pattern.

ix.  Other matters. Any other matters which the City may deem appropriate or that would be of particular relevance to the Planning and Zoning Commission and/or the City Commission at the conceptual development plan review stage. 
c.  Review by Planning and Zoning Commission and City Commission. The procedures for review of the conceptual development plan and the rezoning are stipulated below: 
i.  Consideration by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider all aspects of the conceptual development plan necessary to meet the intent and requirements of this Article and the Comprehensive Plan. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall also consider the recommendations and comments of the Administrative Official. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall evaluate the conceptual development plan as defined in Section 4-20.3(B). The Planning and Zoning Commission shall recommend to the City Commission based on whether the conceptual development plan is consistent with Comprehensive Plan and whether the conceptual development plan is consistent with any site plan review considerations (ref. Article XVIII) and performance criteria (ref. Chapter III). 
The burden is on the applicant to demonstrate that the development is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. Furthermore, through the conceptual development plan the applicant must demonstrate that the proposed development can comply with all provisions of the land development regulations. The applicant/developer is not required to satisfy all regulations governing site plan approval at this stage of the review process. However, the applicant/developer must demonstrate through the conceptual development plan that the proposed development can reasonably be anticipated to satisfy site plan review requirements, including all performance criteria, within the timeframes mutually agreed upon. 
ii.  Action by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall recommend approval, approval with modifications or conditions, or shall deny approval of the conceptual development plan. Such decisions shall be endorsed on the face of each copy of the conceptual development plan by the chairman of the Planning and Zoning Commission. If the Planning and Zoning Commission recommends approval with or without modifications, such recommendation and reasons for the Planning and Zoning Commission action shall be reduced to writing and forwarded to the City Commission. If the Planning and Zoning Commission denies approval, the City Commission will not review the conceptual development plan unless the decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission is appealed as provided in the following Paragraph. 
iii.  Effect of Planning and Zoning Commission denial. If the Planning and Zoning Commission denies approval of the conceptual development plan, the plan shall not be considered by the City Commission unless the applicant shall appeal the decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission to the City Commission. Such notice of appeal shall be in writing and must be filed with the City Clerk within ten working days following action by the Planning and Zoning Commission. If the decision is not appealed the applicant may initiate another application for planned development as specified herein for the original application submitted. 
iv.  Consideration by City Commission. The City Commission shall consider the recommendations and comments of the Planning and Zoning Commission and Administrative Official. The City Commission may make such investigations as may be deemed reasonably necessary to ensure conformity with the intent and requirements of this Article. 
v.  Action by the City Commission. The City Commission shall approve, approve with modifications or conditions, or deny the conceptual development plan, or may refer the plan to the Planning and Zoning Commission for further consideration. In making its decision, the City Commission shall consider all aspects of the conceptual development plan necessary to meet the intent and requirements of this Article and the Comprehensive Plan. 
vi.  Conditions. In approving a conceptual development plan, the City Commission may establish such conditions and may require such modifications as shall ensure compliance with the planned unit development standards and regulations and, further, the City Commission may waive or modify subdivision, site plan or other zoning requirements otherwise applicable to the development when such waiver or conflict is not in conflict with the City's Comprehensive Plan or the intent and purpose of the land development regulations. 
vii.  Application for rezoning. In the event that a conceptual development plan shall be disapproved by the City Commission, the application for rezoning shall thereby be deemed to be denied. In the event that the City Commission shall approve, or approve with modifications or conditions, a conceptual development plan, the City Commission shall thereupon grant with conditions the rezoning application accompanying said plan. 
viii.  Requests for additional information. Prior to, or in addition to, approval of a conceptual development plan, and upon a determination that additional information is necessary for proper review of a planned unit development project, the City Commission may require the submission of additional information by the applicant. The review of such additional information shall follow the procedures applicable to the review of the conceptual development plan. 
ix.  Amendments of conceptual development plans. Once a conceptual development plan has been approved, and there is cause for amendment of the same, or any portion thereof, such amendment and applicable fee shall be processed in a like manner as the original submission and fee. However, there shall be no requirement to file an amended rezoning application unless the proposed amendment would so dictate. 
x.  Prescribed time limit for development. Any City Commission approval of a planned unit development application shall be subject to a prescribed time limit of not more than 18 months for the submission and approval of a site plan. If the developer cannot meet this requirement, the developer shall request a public hearing for purposes of demonstrating why the planned unit development should not be terminated. If the developer does not appear before the City Commission to preserve the planned unit development or if the developer fails to demonstrate why an extension should be granted, then the City Commission may initiate rezoning of the property to an appropriate zoning classification, pursuant to the procedures outlined in Section 1-2.8 of the land development regulations. The prescribed time limit for the submission and approval of a site plan may be extended by the City Commission, for reasonable cause, if the developer presents evidence within the 11/2-year period which demonstrates that the developer has progressed in good faith toward implementing the concept development plan. 
B.  Required form and content of conceptual development plan. An official application for planned unit development zoning shall be accompanied by a conceptual development plan which includes, as a minimum, the following: 
1.  Vicinity map. A vicinity map drawn to a scale of one inch equals 2,000 feet or such other scale as shall be approved by the Administrative Official shall be submitted and shall clearly show the site in relationship to its surroundings, including, as a minimum, all property within 1,000 feet of the project boundaries.

v.  Conditions. In approving a preliminary development plan, the City Commission may establish such conditions and may require such modifications as shall assure compliance with the planned unit development standards and regulations and further, the City Commission may waive or modify subdivision, site plan or other zoning requirements otherwise applicable to the development when such waiver or modification is not in conflict with the City's Comprehensive Plan or the intent and purpose of the land development regulations. 
vi.  Requests for additional information. Prior to, or in addition to, approval of a preliminary development plan, and upon a determination that additional information is necessary for proper review of a planned unit development project, the City Commission may require the submission of additional information by the applicant. The review of such additional information shall follow the procedures applicable to the review of the preliminary development plan. 
vii.  Amendments of preliminary development plans. Once a preliminary development plan has been approved, and there is cause for amendment of the same, or any portion thereof, such amendment shall be processed in a like manner as the original submission. However, there shall be no requirement to file an amended rezoning application and conceptual development plan, unless the proposed amendment would so dictate. 
viii.  Prescribed time limit for development. The City Commission shall approve a preliminary development plan application subject to a prescribed time limit of not more than 18 months for the submission and approval of a final planned unit development plan. If the developer cannot meet this requirement, the developer shall request a public hearing for purposes of demonstrating why the planned unit development should not be terminated. If the developer does not appear before the City Commission to preserve the planned unit development or if the developer fails to demonstrate why an extension should be granted then the City Commission may initiate the rezoning of the property to an appropriate zoning classification pursuant to the procedures outlined in Section 1-2.8 of the land development regulations.

    Ordinary high-water line. This shall constitute the landward edge of a given water body during normal hydrological conditions and the elevation established by a compilation of relevant evidence, specific to a water body, which includes: 
Botanical indicators. The presence of water for sufficient periods of time precludes the existence of terrestrial plant communities and tends to establish conditions whereby shoreline plant species (hydrophytic) inhabit the nearshore and shoreline areas. As these communities tend to change at a slow rate, they are widely utilized to accurately distinguish the uplands from those lands susceptible to the normal inundation of a specific water body. The ordinary high-water line shall be indicated by that elevation where upland, terrestrial plant communities tend to terminate and shoreline (hydrophyte) plants are established as the prevalent plant community(ies). 
Physical indicators. Any observable physical feature along a given shoreline resulting from the presence of water in a given water body for sufficient periods of time so as to leave a physical line, mark, or other distinguishable feature, which includes, but is not limited to: water marks on trees, older docks and seawalls, and water marks on older bridges and abutments. For the purposes of this rule and to aid in an accurate establishment of the ordinary high-water line, the affidavits and like testimony of longtime residents of a given water body and other acceptable collateral evidence shall be an acceptable indicator. 
Geomorphological indicators and compositional changes in soils. The normal sustained presence of water along a given shoreline of either lakes (still waters) or streams (flowing waters) tends to leave specific surficial indications of that normal sustained preserve, such as deposits of organic silts, peat and muck, natural beach ridges and scarps and natural levees. These deposits and other indicators may be multiple, depicting historical sustained low-water elevations. The elevation of the high-water line is indicated by the most landward scarp, beach ridge or levee found along a given shoreline and is likewise indicated by the highest or most landward silt, peat or muck deposits or the most landward stratification of those deposits. 
Water level records. Water level elevations obtained and recorded by a governmental agency, registered land surveyor, or others whose records are verifiable can be used to establish the ordinary high-water elevation. These records can span for a period of at least 20 consecutive years which, with the approval of the City Engineer or other designated staff, shall then be considered as primary evidence. 
Controlled lake elevation. Where lake elevations are controlled by properly engineered structures, the normal high-water line is assumed to be one-half foot above said control elevation. Where a conflict between the ordinary high-water line established by this method and the other indicators contained herein exists, a determination of said line will be made by the City Engineer or other designated staff. Said determination should include all of the indicators contained herein, but additional hydrologic surveys or engineering studies may be required. 
    Outdoor storage. The keeping, in an unroofed area, of any goods, junk, material, merchandise, or vehicles in the same place for more than 24 hours. 
    Owner. Any and all persons, firms, entities, partnerships, trusts, corporations, associations, or other organizations who possess sufficient proprietary interest to seek development of land regulated by this Code.

    Parking space, offstreet. Shall mean a space adequate for parking an automobile with room for opening doors on both sides, together with properly related access to a public street or alley and maneuvering room. Required offstreet parking areas for three or more automobiles shall have individual spaces marked and shall be so designed, maintained and regulated that no parking or maneuvering incidental to parking shall be on any public street, walk or alley, and so that any automobile may be parked and unparked without moving another. 
    For purposes of rough computation, an offstreet parking space and necessary access and maneuvering room may be estimated at 300 square feet, but offstreet parking requirements will be considered to be met only when actual spaces meeting the requirements above are provided and maintained, improved in a manner appropriate to the circumstances of the case, and in accordance with all ordinances and regulations of the City. 
    Parks and recreation, active. Public parks and recreation land and facilities developed for active use by the general public, including playground activities, ballfields, shuffleboard courts, and other similar active recreation uses open to the general public.

    Yard. An open space at grade between the principal or accessory building or buildings and the nearest lot line. Such yard is unoccupied and unobstructed from the ground upward, except as may be specifically provided for in this Code. In measuring a yard for the purpose of determining the width of a side yard, the depth of a front yard, or the depth of a rear yard, the minimum horizontal distance between the lot line and the main building shall be used. 
Yard, back . That area of a lot or parcel located behind the rear building facade of the principal structure and extending to the rear property line. 
Yard, front. A yard extending across the front of a lot between the side yard lines, which is the minimum horizontal distance between the street line and the main building or any projections thereof other than projections or encroachments specifically provided for in this Code. On corner lots the front yard shall be considered as being that portion on which the structure fronts. 
Yard, rear. A yard extending across the rear of a lot between the side lot lines and which is the minimum horizontal distance between the rear of the main building or any projections thereof other than projections or encroachments specifically provided for in this Code.

For all corner lots, the side yard shall be as indicated below. 
Yard, rear and side (corner lot). On corner parcels abutting two intersecting streets there shall be only one side yard. The remaining parcel line shall be deemed the rear parcel line. The side parcel line shall be determined as follows: 
a.  The parcel line opposite the parcel line having the greatest street frontage; or 
b.  If the parcel lines abutting on both streets are of equal length, the side parcel line shall be determined as follows: 
i.  Where the corner parcel abuts both a side parcel line and a rear parcel line on adjacent parcels, the side parcel line for the corner parcel shall be the same as for the abutting line. 
ii.  Where the corner parcel abuts either two side parcel lines or two rear parcel lines on adjacent parcels, the side parcel line for the corner parcel shall be designated by the applicant at the time of his application for a site development permit or development plan approval, as applicable. 
c.  On corner parcels abutting three intersecting streets, the remaining parcel line shall be deemed the side parcel line.
