PREFACE 
    This Code is a revision and codification of the ordinances of the Village of Hazel Crest of a general and permanent nature. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all ordinances not included therein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been appropriately catchlined to facilitate usage. Appropriate footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state laws have been included. Also, the source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. 
    The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and municipal codes. Each section number consists of two component parts separated by a dash, the figure before the dash referring to the chapter number and the figure after the dash referring to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the fourteenth section of Chapter 17 is 17-14. Under this system each section is identified with its chapter and, at the same time, new sections, or even whole chapters, can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three (3) sections that would logically come between Sections 4-4 and 4-5 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 4-4.1, 4-4.2, 4-4.3, respectively. New chapters may be included by the addition of a fraction after the chapter number; e.g., if the new material is to be included between Chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as Chapter 121/2. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive number being assigned to the article or division. 
    The general index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by city officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. 
    A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this looseleaf system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to the holders of the Codes with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when incorporated into the Code, may be cited as a part hereof, as provided in Section 5 of the Adopting Ordinance. 
    The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publishers that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
    The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of George R. Langford, President, and James S. Vaught, Editor of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publishers are most grateful to Mr. Martin J. Kauchak, Village President, Mr. Mario H. Guidarelli, Village Attorney, Mrs. Rita C. Besse, Village Clerk and the members of the Village Board of Trustees for their supervision, cooperation and interest during the progress of the work on this Code. 
    This Code is presented for the use and benefit of the citizens of the Village of Hazel Crest, Illinois.

Sec. 1-4. - Amendments to Code. 
    All ordinances passed subsequent to this Code which amend, repeal or in any way affect this Code may be numbered in accordance with the numbering system of this Code and printed for inclusion herein, or in the case of repealed chapters, sections and subsections, or any part thereof, by subsequent ordinances, such repealed portions may be excluded from the Code by omission from reprinted pages affected thereby, and the subsequent ordinances as numbered and printed or omitted, in the case of repeal, shall be prima facie evidence of such subsequent ordinances until such time as this Code and subsequent ordinances numbered or omitted are readopted as a new code by the board of trustees. 
Sec. 1-5. - Publication and recording of ordinances. 
(a)  All ordinances passed by the president and board of trustees shall be recorded by the clerk in a book kept for village ordinances. The original shall be filed in the office of the village clerk and due proof of publication of all ordinances requiring publication shall be procured by the clerk, which proof of affidavit of publication shall be attached to and filed with the ordinances. The clerk shall also note on his book of ordinances, at the foot of the record of each ordinance, a memorandum of the date of the passage thereof and, if published or posted, the date of such publication or posting. 
(b)  All ordinances passed by the president and board of trustees shall be written, printed or published on paper uniform in size and substantially the size of each page of this Code, with the left-hand margin thereof sufficiently wide for binding. They will bear a number starting from 1 at the beginning of each year and progressing numerically for each ordinance, followed by a hyphen and the 4 digits of the current year. The village clerk will bind all ordinances in a book or suitable cover in the order of passage, and will maintain therewith a complete index of all ordinances contained therein, together with a memorandum of the date of passage and, if published or posted, the date of publication or posting. The village clerk will have the current book or binder of ordinances available at each regular or special meeting of the board of trustees, and in addition thereto shall keep at least one copy of this Code, which he shall mark in the following manner: Whenever any ordinance which amends or makes an addition to this Code is passed and approved, he shall note in the margin of the section or sections amended that the amendment has been made and where the amendment may be found in the amendment book, and in the case of an addition, he shall make a notation in the appropriate place that such addition has been made, with a similar reference to the amendment book. 
(Code 1956, §§ 1.09, 2.01)

Any such collection agency shall, for purposes of collection of such fine, charge, penalty or payment, be deemed an agent of the village. All costs incurred by the village for the collection of any fines, charges, penalties or payments transferred to any such collection agency shall be assessed against the responsible person as an additional fine, charge, penalty or payment, subject to any applicable statutory limits.

Sec. 1-11. - Recovery of fines. 
    All fines, forfeitures, penalties and costs imposed against any person by any of the ordinances of the village may be recovered before any judge of the county by action of debt in the name of the village, and judgment may be rendered thereon and collected by execution or other process as other judgments are rendered and collected. 
(Code 1956, § 17.07) 
Sec. 1-12. - Commitment for failure to pay fines.

The electric utility company shall thereafter submit a complete emergency energy plan to the village no later than thirty (30) days after such notices are sent by the village. 
(b)  The village and the electric utility shall work cooperatively to: 
(1)  Identify customers and facilities for which a controlled rotating interruption of electric service would require heightened response by village public health and safety agencies; 
(2)  Mitigate the potential impact of the plan on public health and safety; and

Sec. 11-1. - Short title. 
    This chapter shall be known and may be cited and referred to as the "Floodplain Management Ordinance for the Village of Hazel Crest, Illinois." 
(Ord. No. 13-2008, § 1, 6-10-08) 
Sec. 11-2. - Purpose. 
    This chapter is enacted pursuant to the police powers granted to this village by 65 ILCS 5/1-2-1, 5/11-12-12, 5/11-30-2, 5/11-30-8, and 5/11-31-2(1994). The purpose of this chapter is to maintain the Village of Hazel Crest's eligibility in the National Flood Insurance Program; to minimize potential losses due to periodic flooding including loss of life, loss of property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare; and to preserve and enhance the quality of surface waters, conserve economic and natural values and provide for the wise utilization of water and related land resources. This chapter is adopted in order to accomplish the following specific purposes: 
(1)  To meet the requirements of 615 ILCS 5/1/g River, Lakes and Streams Act. 
(2)  To assure that new development does not increase the flood or drainage hazards to others, or creating unstable conditions susceptible to erosion; 
(3)  To protect new buildings and major improvements to buildings from flood damage; 
(4)  To protect human life and health from the hazards of flooding; 
(5)  To lessen the burden on the taxpayer for flood control projects, repairs to flood-damaged public facilities and utilities, and flood rescue and relief operations; and 
(6)  To make federally subsidized flood insurance available for property in the Village of Hazel by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program; 
(7)  To comply with rules and regulations of the National Flood Insurance Program codified as 44 CFR 59-79, as amended; 
(8)  To protect, conserve, and promote the orderly development of land and water resources; 
(9)  To preserve the natural characteristics and functions of watercourses and floodplains in order to moderate flood and stormwater impacts, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community and economic development. 
(Ord. No. 13-2008, § 1, 6-10-08) 
Sec. 11-3. - Definitions. 
    For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions are adopted: 
    Act: An act in relation to the regulation of the rivers, lakes and streams of the State of Illinois, 615 ILCS 5/5 et seq. 
    Applicant: Any person, firm, corporation or agency which submits an application. 
    Appropriate use: Only uses of the designated floodway that are permissible and will be considered for permit issuance. The only uses that will be allowed are as specified in Section 802.0. 
    Base flood: The flood having a one-per cent probability of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood is also known as the 100-year frequency flood event. Application of the base flood elevation at any location is as defined in section 11-6 of this chapter. 
    Building: A structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a manufactured home, mobile home or a prefabricated building. 
    Channel: Any river, stream, creek, brook, branch, natural or artificial depression, ponded area, flowage, slough, ditch, conduit, culvert, gully, ravine, wash, or natural or manmade drainageway, which has a definite bed and banks or shoreline, in or into which surface or groundwater flows, either perennially or intermittently. 
    Channel modification: Alteration of a channel by changing the physical dimensions or materials of its bed or banks. Channel modification includes damming, rip-rapping (or other armoring), widening, deepening, straightening, relocation, lining and significant removal of native vegetation from the bottom or banks channel modification does not include the clearing of dead or dying vegetation, debris, or trash form the channel. Channelization is a server form of channel modification involving a significant change in the channel cross-section and typically involving relocation of the existing channel (e.g., straightening). 
    Compensatory storage: An artificially excavated, hydraulically equivalent volume of storage within the SFHA used to balance the loss of natural flood storage capacity when artificial fill or structures are placed within the floodplain. The uncompensated loss of natural floodplain storage can increase off-site floodwater elevations and flows. 
    Conditional approval of a designated floodway map change: Preconstruction approval by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of a proposed change to the floodway map. This preconstruction approval, pursuant to (this part, gives assurances to the property owner that once an appropriate use is constructed according to permitted plans, the floodway map can be changed, as previously agreed, upon review and acceptance of as-built plans. 
    Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR): A letter which indicates that the Federal Emergency Management Agency will revise base flood elevations, flood insurance rate zones, flood boundaries or floodways as shown on the effective flood hazard boundary map or flood insurance rate map, once the as-built plans are submitted and approved. 
    Control structure: A structure designed to control the rate of flow that passes through the structure, given a specific upstream and downstream water surface elevation. 
    Dam: All obstructions, wall embankments or barriers, together with their abutments and appurtenant works, if any, constructed for the purpose of storing or diverting water or creating a pool underground storage tanks are not included. 
    Designated floodway: The channel, including on-stream lakes, and that portion of the floodplain adjacent to a stream or watercourse as designated by IDNR/OWR, which is needed to store and convey the existing ten-year frequency flood discharge with no more than a one-tenth (0.1) foot increase in stage due to the loss of flood conveyance or storage, and no more than a ten (10) per cent increase in velocities. 
(1)  The floodways are designated for the Calumet Union drainage ditch southwest branch, Cherry Creek east branch and Cherry Creek west branch (map number 17031C0729J, map number 17031C0733J, map number 17031C0734J and map number 17031C0737J) on the Countywide Flood Insurance Rate Map of Cook County prepared by FEMA and dated August 19, 2008. 
(2)  The floodways for those parts of unincorporated Cook County that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Village of Hazel Crest that may be annexed into the village are designated for the Calumet Union drainage ditch southwest branch, Cherry Creek east branch and Cherry Creek west branch, (map number 17031C0729J map number 17031C0733J, map number 17031C0734J and map number 17031C0737J) on the Countywide Flood Insurance Rate Map of Cook County prepared by FEMA and dated August 19, 2008. 
(3)  To locate the designated floodway boundary on any site, the designated floodway boundary should be scaled off the designated floodway map and located on a site plan, using reference marks common to both maps. Where interpretation is needed to determine the exact location of the designated floodway boundary, IDNR/OWR should be contacted for the interpretation.

Sec. 11-4. - How to use this chapter. 
(a)  The director of public works shall be responsible for fulfilling all of the duties listed in section 11-5. 
(b)  To fulfill those duties, the director of public works first should use the criteria listed in section 11-6, base flood elevations, to determine whether the development site is located within a floodplain. Once it has been determined that a site is located within a floodplain, the director of public works must determine whether the development site is within a flood fringe, a designated floodway, or within a SFHA or floodplain for which no floodway has been identified. If the site is within a flood fringe, the director of public works shall require that the minimum requirements of section 11-7 be met. If the site is within a floodway, the director of public works shall require that the minimum requirements of section 11-8 be met. If the site is located within a SFHA or floodplain for which no detailed study has been completed and approved, the director of public works shall require that the minimum requirements of section 11-9 be met. 
(c)  In addition, the general requirements of section 11-10 shall be met for all developments meeting the requirements of sections 11-7, 11-8 or 11-9, the director of public works shall assure that all subdivision proposals shall meet the requirements of section 11-11. 
(d)  If a variance is to be granted for a proposal, the director of public works shall review the requirements of section 11-12 to make sure they are met. In addition the director of public works shall complete all notification requirements. 
(e)  In order to assure that property owners obtain permits as required in this chapter, the director of public works may take any and all actions as outlined in section 11-14. 
(Ord. No. 13-2008, § 1, 6-10-08) 
Sec. 11-5. - Duties of the enforcement official(s). 
    The director of public works shall be responsible for the general administration and enforcement of this chapter, which shall include the following: 
(1)  Determining the floodplain designation. Check all new development sites to determine whether they are in a special flood hazard area (SFHA). If they are in a SFHA, determine whether they are in a floodway, flood fringe or in a floodplain for which a detailed study has not been conducted and which drains more than one (1) square mile. Check whether the development is potentially within an extended SFHA (with a drainage area less than one (1) square mile), indicating that the development would have adverse impacts regarding storage, conveyance, or inundation which would be the basis for the applicant being required to delineate the floodplain and floodway and be subject to the remaining sections of this chapter. 
(2)  Professional engineer review. If the development site is within a floodway or in a floodplain for which a detailed study has not been conducted and which drains more than one (1) square mile, the permit shall be referred to a registered professional engineer under the employ or contract of the Village of Hazel Crest for review to ensure that the development meets sections 11-8 or 11-9. In the case of an appropriate use, the P.E. shall state in writing the development meets the requirements of section 11-8. 
(3)  Dam safety requirements. Ensure that an IDNR/OWR permit has been issued or a letter indicating no permit is required, if the proposed development activity includes construction of a dam as defined in section 11-3. Regulated dams may include weirs, restrictive culverts or impoundment structures. 
(4)  Other permit requirements. Ensure that any and all required federal, state and local permits are received prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit. 
(5)  Plan review and permit issuance. Ensure that all development activities within the SFHAS of the jurisdiction of the Village of Hazel Crest meet the requirements of this chapter, and; issue a floodplain development permit in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and other regulations of this community when the development meets the conditions of this chapter. 
(6)  Inspection review. Inspect all development projects before, during and after construction to assure proper elevation of the structure and to ensure compliance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(7)  Elevation and floodproofing certificates. Maintain permit files including: 
a.  An elevation certificate certifying the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of a residential or nonresidential building subject to section 11-10 of this chapter; and/or 
b.  The elevation to which a nonresidential building has been floodproofed, using a floodproofing certificate, for all buildings subjects to section 11-10 of this chapter. 
(8)  Records for public inspections. Maintain for public inspection and furnish upon request base flood data, SFHA and designated floodway maps, copies of federal or state permit documents, variance documentation, conditional letter of map revision, letter of map revision, letter of map amendment and "as-built" elevation and floodproofing and/or elevation certificates for all buildings constructed subject to this chapter. 
(9)  State permits. Ensure that construction authorization has been granted by IDNR/OWR, for all development projects subject to sections 11-8 and 11-9 of this chapter, unless enforcement responsibility has been delegated to the Village of Hazel Crest. However, the following review approvals are not delegated to the Village of Hazel Crest and shall require review or permits form IDNR/OWR: 
a.  Organizations which are exempt from this article, as per the Illinois Compiled Statutes; 
b.  IDNR/OWR projects, dams or impoundment structures as defined in section 11-3 and all other state, federal or local unit of government projects, including projects of the Village of Hazel Crest and county, except for those projects meeting the requirements of subsection 11-8(2)g.; 
c.  An engineer's determination that an existing bridge or culvert crossing is not a source of flood damage and the analysis indicating the proposed flood profile, per subsection 11-8(2)c.5. 
d.  An engineer's analysis of the flood profile due to subsection 11-8(2)c.4.; 
e.  Alternative transition sections and hydraulically equivalent compensatory storage as indicated in subsection 11-8(2)c.1., 2., [and] 8.; 
f.  Permit issuance of structures within, under, or over publicly navigable rivers, lakes and streams; 
g.  Any changes in the base flood elevation or floodway locations; and 
h.  Base flood elevation determinations where none now exist. 
(10)  Cooperation with other agencies. Cooperate with state and federal floodplain management agencies to improve base flood or 100-year frequency flood and floodway data and to improve the administration of this chapter; submit data to IDNR/OWR and FEMA for proposed revisions of a regulatory map; submit reports as required for the National Flood Insurance Program; and notify FEMA of any proposed amendments to this chapter. 
(11)  Promulgate regulations. Promulgate rules and regulations as necessary to administer and enforce the provisions of this chapter, subject however to the review and approval of IDNR/OWR and FEMA for any ordinance changes.

Sec. 11-6. - Base flood elevation. 
    This chapter's protection standard is based on the flood insurance study for the Village of Hazel Crest. If a base flood elevation or 100-year frequency flood elevation is not available for a particular site, then the protection standard shall be according to the best existing data available in the Illinois State Water Survey's Floodplain Information Repository that has been approved by IDNR/OWR and FEMA. When a party disagrees with best available data, he/she may finance the detailed engineering study needed to replace existing data with better data and submit it to IDNR/OWR and FEMA. 
(1)  The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of the Calumet Union Drainage Ditch southwest branch, Cherry Creek EAST branch and Cherry Creek west branch shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the Countywide Flood Insurance Study of Cook County prepared by FEMA and dated August 19, 2008, and such amendments to such study and maps as may be prepared from time to time. 
(2)  The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of those parts of unincorporated Cook County that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Village of Hazel Crest or that may be annexed into the Village of Hazel Crest shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Cook County prepared by FEMA and dated August 19, 2008, and such amendments or revisions to such study as may be prepared from time to time. 
(3)  The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each SFHA delineated as an "AH Zone" or "AO Zone" shall be that elevation (or depth) delineated on the flood insurance rate map of the Village of Hazel Crest. 
(4)  The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each of the remaining SFHAs delineated as an "A Zone" on the Flood Insurance Rate Map of the Village of Hazel Crest shall be according to the best existing data available in the Illinois State Water Survey Floodplain Information Repository. When no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation exists, the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for a riverine SFHA shall be determined from a backwater model, such as HEC-Il, WSP-2, or a dynamic model such as HIP. The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from a hydrologic model, such as HEC-I, TR-20, or HIP, or by techniques presented in various publications prepared by the United States Geological Survey for estimating peak flood discharges. Along any watercourses draining more than one (1) square mile, the above analyses shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR for approval. Once approved it must be submitted to the Illinois State Water Survey Floodplain Information Repository for filing. For a nonriverine SFHA, the base flood elevation shall be the historic flood of record plus three (3) feet, unless calculated by a detailed engineering study and approved by IDNR/OWR for drainage areas greater than one (1) square mile. For an unmapped extended SFHA (with a drainage area less than one (1) square mile) which has been identified by the director of public works pursuant to subsection 11-5(1), the base flood elevation shall be determined by the applicant utilizing a method as approved in subsection 11-6(1), with concurrence of the director of public works.

Sec. 11-7. - Occupation and use of flood fringe areas. 
    Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe will be permitted if protection is provided against the base flood or 100-year frequency flood by proper elevation, and compensatory storage, and other applicable provisions of the chapter. No use will be permitted which adversely affects the capacity of drainage facilities or systems. Developments located within the flood fringe shall meet the requirements of this section, along with requirements of section 11-10. 
(1)  Development permit. No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by state law shall commence any development in the SFHA without first obtaining a development permit from the director of public works of the Village of Hazel Crest. 
a.  Application for a development permit shall be made on a form provided by the director of public works. The application shall be accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to scale, showing property line dimensions and legal description for the property and sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or land surveyor; existing grade elevations in M.S.L., 11929 adj. datum or N.G.V.D. and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling; the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings. For all proposed buildings, the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) and lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on the submitted plans and the development will be subject to the requirements of section 11-10 of this chapter. 
b.  Upon receipt of a development permit application, the director of public works shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. Any development located on land that can be shown to be higher than the base flood elevation of the current flood insurance rate map and which has not been filled after the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map without a permit as required by this chapter is not in the SFHA and, therefore, not subject to the requirements of this chapter. The building official of the Village of Hazel Crest shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this ground elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification. 
c.  A soil erosion and sediment control plan for disturbed areas shall be submitted. This plan shall include a description of the sequence of grading activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a description of final stabilization and revegetation measures, and the identification of a responsible party to ensure post-construction maintenance. 
d.  The director of public works shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other federal, sate, and local permits, approvals or permit-not-required letters that may be required for this type of activity. The director of public works shall not issue a permit unless all other federal, state, and local permits have been obtained. 
(2)  Preventing increased damages. No development in the flood fringe shall create a threat to public health and safety. 
a.  If fill is being used to elevate the site above the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit sufficient data and obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA for the purpose of removing the site from the floodplain. 
b.  Compensatory storage. Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken from below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation. The excavation volume shall be at least equal to one and one-half (1.5) times the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure. In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied. All floodplain storage lost below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.

The director of public works shall not issue the development permit unless all required federal and state permits have been obtained. A registered professional engineer, under the employ or contract of the Village of Hazel Crest shall review and approve applications reviewed under this section. 
(2)  Preventing increased damages and a list of appropriate uses. 
a.  The only development in a floodway which will be allowed are appropriate uses, which will not cause a rise in the base flood elevation, and which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or be a threat to public health and safety and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or permanently impair existing water quality or aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this chapter. Only those appropriate uses listed in 92 Ill. Adm. Code Part 708 will be allowed. The approved appropriate uses are as follows: 
1.  Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or private improvements relating tot he control of drainage, flooding erosion, or water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife. 
2.  Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring access to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities and improvements related to recreational boating, commercial shipping and other functionally water dependent uses; 
3.  Storm and sanitary sewer relief outfalls; 
4.  Underground and overhead utilities; 
5.  Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems, including any related fencing (at least fifty (50) per cent open when viewed from any one (1) direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and including open air pavilions and toilet facilities (four (4) stall maximum) that will not block flood flows nor reduce floodway storage; 
6.  Detached garages, storage sheds, or other nonhabitable accessory structures that will not block flood flows nor reduce floodway storage; 
7.  Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and taxiways and any modification thereto; 
8.  Parking lots built at or below existing grade where either: 
(i)  The depth of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event will not exceed one (1) foot; or 
(ii)  The applicant of a short-term recreational use facility parking lot, formally agrees to restrict access during overbank flooding events and accepts liability for all damages caused by vehicular access during all overbank flooding events. 
9.  Designated floodway regrading, without fill, to create a positive nonerosive slope toward a watercourse. 
10.  Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful structures including the construction of water-tight window wells, elevating structures, or construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be no more than ten (10) feet away from the exterior wall of the existing structure, and, which are not considered substantial improvements to the structure. 
11.  The replacement, reconstruction, or repair of a damaged building, provided that the outside dimensions are not increased, and if the building was damaged to fifty (50) per cent or more of the market value before the damage occurred, the building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation. 
12.  Modifications to an existing building that would not increase the enclosed floor area of the building below the 100-year frequency flood elevation, and which will not block flood flows including but not limited to, fireplaces, bay windows, decks, patios, and second story additions. If the building improved to fifty (50) per cent or more of the market value before the modification occurred (i.e., a substantial improvement), the building will be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation. 
b.  Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts, excavation or channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise nonappropriate uses in the floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting designed to act as a fence) and storage of materials except as specifically defined above as an appropriate use. 
c.  Within the designated floodway as identified on the floodway maps designated by IDNR/OWR, the construction of an appropriate use, will be considered permissible provided that the proposed project meets the following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and data by a register professional engineer and provided that any structure meets the protection requirements of section 11-10 of this chapter: 
1.  Preservation of flood conveyance, so as not to increase flood stages upstream. For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings, on-stream structures or dams, all effective designated floodway conveyance lost due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective designated floodway conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into consideration: 
(i)  Designated floodway conveyance, "K" = (1 .486/n)(AR 2/3 ) where "n" is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective flow area of the cross-section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter (see Open Channel Hydraulics, Ven Te Chow, 1959, McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York). 
(ii)  The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a federal, state or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative to a nonvegetative land cover. 
(iii)  Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations of effective designated floodway conveyance. The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency: 
(a)  When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one (1) foot horizontal for every four (4) feet of the flooded stream's length. 
(b)  When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one (1) foot horizontal for every one (1) foot of the flooded stream's length. 
(c)  When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one (1) foot vertical transition for every ten (10) feet of stream length shall be used. 
(d)  Transition sections shall be provided between cross-sections with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the designated floodway delineation on adjacent properties. 
(e)  All cross-sections used in the calculations shall be located perpendicular to flood flows. 
2.  Preservation of floodway storage so as not to increase downstream flooding. 
(i)  Compensatory storage shall be provided for any designated floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or structures placed and the impact of any related flood control projects. 
(ii)  Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at least one and one-half (1.5) times the volume of floodplain storage lost. 
(iii)  Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced. 
(iv)  The compensatory designated floodway storage shall be placed between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year flood elevation. All designated floodway storage lost below the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All designated floodway storage lost above the existing ten-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed ten-year flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse. 
(v)  If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of the proposed construction, the applicant's engineer shall demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through a determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that the compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent. 
(vi)  There shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a result of a floodway modification, unless such modification is necessary to reduce flooding at existing structure. 
3.  Preservation of floodway velocities so as not to increase stream erosion or flood heights. 
(i)  For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts or on stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in the average channel or designated floodway velocities or stage for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. 
(ii)  In the case of bridges or culverts or on stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flows, velocities may be increased at the structure site, if scour, erosion and sedimentation will be avoided by the use of rip-rap or other design measures. 
4.  Construction of new bridges or culvert crossings and roadway approaches. 
(i)  The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of upstream flood stages greater than one-tenth-foot when compared to the existing conditions for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event; or the upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements. 
(ii)  If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood stages greater than one-tenth-foot, the developer must contact IDNR/OWR to obtain a permit for a dam or waiver. 
(a)  The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be calculated using the flood study flows, and corresponding flood elevations for tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in section 11-6 of this chapter. Culverts must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT, FHWA~Hydraulic Chart for the Selection of Highway Culverts. Bridges must be analyzed using the U.S. DOT/Federal Highway Administration Hydraulics of Bridge Waterways calculations procedure. 
(b)  Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per subsection 11-8(2)c.2. 
(c)  Velocity increases must be mitigated per subsection 11-8(2)c.5. 
(d)  If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is used for recreational or commercial navigation, an IDNR/OWR permit must be received. 
(e)  The hydraulic analysis for the backwater caused by the bridge showing the existing condition and proposed regulatory profile must be submitted to IDNR/OWR for concurrence that a CLOMR is not required by subsection 11-8(2). 
(f)  All excavations for the construction of the crossing shall be designed per subsection 11-8(2)c.8. 
5.  Reconstruction or modification of existing bridges, culverts, and approach roads. 
(i)  The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or modification shall be constructed with no more than one-tenth-foot increase in backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a source of flood damage. 
(ii)  If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain, the applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties. 
(iii)  The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is a source flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in accordance with 92 Ill. Adm. Code Part 708 (Floodway Construction in Northeastern Illinois) and submitted to IDNR/OWR for review and concurrence before a permit is issued. 
6.  On-stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water. 
(i)  Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than zero (0.0) foot when compared to the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event shall be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or flood walls or within recorded flood easements. 
(ii)  A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be obtained from IDNR/OWR for any structure built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flow. 
(iii)  All dams and impoundment structures as defined in section 11-3 shall meet the permitting requirements of 92 Ill. Adm. Code Part 702 (Construction and Maintenance of Dams). If the proposed activity involves a modification of the channel or floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that: 
(a)  The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by providing flood control, public recreation, or regional stormwater detention; 
(b)  The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle, such as for spawning; 
(c)  The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures, and a pre-sedimentation basin; 
(d)  A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented in the upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as minimize the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals, and other pollutants. If there is more than one (1) municipality in the upstream watershed, the municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed control; 
(e)  The project otherwise complies with the requirements of section 11-8. 
7.  Floodproofing of existing habitable, residential and commercial structures. 
(i)  If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction shall be placed no further than ten (10) feet from the outside of the building. 
(ii)  Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for floodproofing activities. 
8.  Excavation in the floodway. 
(i)  When excavation is proposed in the design of the bridges and culvert openings, including the modifications to and replacement of existing bridge and culvert structures, or to compensate for lost conveyance or other appropriate uses, transition sections shall be provided for the excavation. 
(ii)  The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions maybe used with the same efficiency: 
(a)  When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one (1) foot horizontal for every four (4) feet of the flooded stream's length; 
(b)  When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one (1) foot horizontal for every one (1) foot of the flood stream's length; 
(c)  When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one (1) foot vertical transition for every ten (10) feet of stream length shall be used;

9.  If the proposed activity involves a channel modification, it shall be demonstrated that: 
(i)  There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the body of water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank stabilization, floodproofing of existing structures, removal of structures from the floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the establishment of a stream side buffer strip or green belt. Channel modification is acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and fish and wildlife habitat; 
(ii)  Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may be destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent degree of natural resource values; 
(iii)  The activity has been planned and designed and will be constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural conditions of the body of water affected, consistent with the following criteria: 
(a)  The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross-section, slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be incorporated into channel modification design, where practical. 
(b)  Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will prevent erosion. 
(c)  One-sided construction of a channel shall be used when feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one (1) side of the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization effects of the vegetation. 
(d)  Clearing of stabilizing vegetation shall be limited to that which is essential for construction of the channel. 
(e)  Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no steeper than 3:1 horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable. Native vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use of alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural rock or rip-rap are preferred approaches. Artificial materials such as concrete, gabions, or construction rubble should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives. 
(f)  All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be seed or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the vegetative cover. 
(g)  If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity such as deep pools, riffles, and other similar features, such features shall be provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established, where appropriate. 
(h)  A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water quality. 
(i)  New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and all items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to diversion of water into the new channel. 
(j)  There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless necessitated by a public flood control project or unless such an increase is justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project. 
(k)  Unless the modification is for a public flood control project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage outside the floodway as a result of the modification. 
(iv)  The project otherwise complies with the requirements of section 11-8. 
10.  Seeding and stabilization plan. For all activities located in a floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant. 
11.  Soil erosion and sedimentation measures. For all activities in the floodway, including grading, filling, and excavation, in which there is potential for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria: 
(i)  The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the maximum vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the time soil is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be destroyed, removed, or disturbed more than fifteen (15) days prior to initiation of improvements. 
(ii)  Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded areas as soon possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be provided within fifteen (15) days after final grade is reached on any portion of the site, and within fifteen (15) days to denuded areas which may not be at final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than sixty (60) days. 
(iii)  Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement of eroded sediments off site or into the channel. Potential sediment control devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion ditches, and sediment raps and basis. 
(iv)  A vegetated buffer strip of at least twenty-five (25) feet in width shall be preserved and/or re-established, where possible, along existing channels (see [subsection] 11-8(2)c.). Construction vehicle use of channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed, where necessary, to minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or along channels shall be restabilized immediately. 
(v)  Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be designed and implemented consistent with "Procedures and Standards for Urban Soil Erosion and Sedimentation Control in Illinois" (1988) also known as the "Green Book" and the Illinois Urban Manual" (NRCS, 1995). 
12.  Public flood control projects. For public flood control projects, the permitting requirements of this section will be considered met if the applicant can demonstrate to IDNR/OWR through hydraulic and hydrologic calculations that the proposed project will not singularly or cumulatively result in increased flood heights outside the project right-of-way or easements for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event. 
13.  General criteria for analysis of flood elevations. 
(i)  The flood profiles, flows and floodway data in the designated floodway study, referenced in section 11-6 must be used for analysis of the base conditions. If the study data appears to be in error or conditions have changed, IDNR/OWR shall be contacted for approval and concurrence on the appropriate base conditions data to use. 
(ii)  If the 100-year floodway elevation at the site of the proposed construction is affected by backwater from a downstream receiving stream with a larger drainage area, the proposed construction shall be shown to meet: 
(a)  The requirements of this section for the 100-year frequency flood elevations of the designated floodway conditions; and 
(b)  Conditions with the receiving stream at normal water elevations. 
(iii)  If the applicant learns from IDNR/OWR, local governments, or a private owner that a downstream restrictive bridge or culvert is scheduled to be removed, reconstructed, modified, or a regional flood control project is scheduled to be built, removed, constructed or modified within the next five (5) years, the proposed construction shall be analyzed and shown to meet the requirements of this section for both the existing conditions and the expected flood profile conditions when the bridge, culvert or flood control project is built. 
14.  Conditional letter of map revision. 
(i)  If the appropriate use would result in a change in the designated floodway location or the 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit to IDNR/OWR and FEMA all information, calculations and documents necessary to be issued a conditional designated floodway map revision and receive from IDNR/OWR a conditional concurrence of the designated floodway change before a permit is issued. 
(ii)  The final designated floodway map will not be changed by FEMA until as-built plans or record drawings of initial filling, grading, dredging, or excavating activities re submitted and accepted by FEMA and IDNR/OWR. 
(iii)  In the case of nongovernment projects, the municipality in incorporated areas and the county in unincorporated areas shall concur with the proposed conditional designated floodway map revision before IDNR/OWR approval can be given. 
(iv)  No filling, grading, dredging or excavating shall take place until a conditional approval is issued. 
(v)  After initial filling, grading, dredging or excavating, no activities shall take place until a final letter of map revision (LOMR) is issued by FEMA with concurrence from IDNR/OWR. 
15.  Professional engineer's supervision. All engineering analyses shall be performed under the supervision of a registered professional engineer. 
16.  For all activities in the floodway involving construction within twenty-five (25) feet of the channel, the following criteria shall be met: 
(i)  A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at least twenty-five (25) feet of the ordinary high water mark of the channel.

Sec. 19-37. - Persons under the influence of intoxicating liquor or narcotic drugs. 
(a)  No person who is under the influence of intoxicating liquor may drive or be in actual physical control of any vehicle within the village. 
(b)  No person who is an habitual user of or under the influence of any narcotic drug, or who is under the influence of any other drug to a degree which renders him incapable of safely driving a vehicle, may drive or be in actual physical control of any vehicle within the village. The fact that a person charged with a violation of this subsection is or has been entitled to use such drug under the laws of this state does not constitute a defense against any charge of violation of this subsection. 
(c)  Upon the trial of any action or proceeding arising out of the acts alleged to have been committed by any person while driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, evidence of the amount of alcohol in the person's blood at the time of the act alleged as shown by a chemical analysis of his breath, blood, urine, saliva or other bodily substance is admissible, as provided in this subsection, and the result of any such analysis shall give rise to the following presumptions: 
(1)  If there was at the time of such analysis 0.05 per cent or less by weight of alcohol in the person's blood, it shall be presumed that the person was not under the influence of intoxicating liquor. 
(2)  If there was at the time of such analysis in excess of 0.05 per cent but less than 0.10 per cent by weight of alcohol in the person's blood, such fact shall not give rise to any presumption that the person was or was not under the influence of intoxicating liquor, but such fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining whether such person was under the influence of intoxicating liquor. 
(3)  If there was at the time of such analysis 0.10 per cent or more by weight of alcohol in the person's blood, it shall be presumed that the person was under the influence of intoxicating liquor. 
    Per cent by weight of alcohol in the blood shall be based upon grams of alcohol per one hundred (100) cubic centimeters of blood. Evidence based upon a chemical analysis of blood, urine, breath or other bodily substance shall not be admitted unless such substance was procured and such analysis made with the consent of the person whose bodily substance was so analyzed. 
    The provisions of this subsection shall not be construed as limiting the introduction of any other competent evidence bearing upon the question of whether or not the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor. 
(d)  Chemical analysis of any person's blood or breath, to be considered valid under this section, must be performed according to uniform standards adopted by the state department of public health, in cooperation with the superintendent of state highway police, and by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by that department for such purpose. 
(e)  When an unconscious person or person otherwise incapable of refusal is given a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under the provisions of this section, only a physician authorized to practice medicine in all its branches, a registered nurse or other qualified person may withdraw blood in a manner prescribed by the department of public health for the purpose of determining the alcoholic content thereof. 
(f)  The person tested may have a physician authorized to practice medicine in all its branches, a qualified technician, chemist, registered nurse or other qualified person of his own choosing to administer a chemical test at his own expense, in addition to any administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer. The failure or inability to obtain an additional test by a person does not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the test taken at the direction of a law enforcement officer. 
(g)  Upon the request of any person who has submitted to a chemical test at the request of a law enforcement officer, full information concerning the test must be made available to him or his attorney. 
(h)  Evidence of a refusal to submit to a chemical test is inadmissable in any civil action or proceeding, or action under this section; however, nothing in this subsection shall prevent the admission of evidence of such refusal in a hearing on the suspension of a person's privilege to operate a motor vehicle.

If the rate of speed of any such vehicle operated on any public highway in the village exceeds the lawfully posted limits, such rate of speed shall be prima facie evidence that the person operating such motor vehicle is driving at a rate of speed greater than is reasonable and proper, having regard to the traffic and the use of the way, or so as to endanger the life, limb, or property of other persons. 
(b)  In the event of a charge of violation of this section, the complaint and the summons or notice to appear shall specify the speed at which the defendant is alleged to have driven, also the prima facie speed applicable within the district or at the location.

(d)  If the village president and the board of trustees set other limits by ordinance as provided by statute after an engineering or traffic survey, such limits shall govern the rate of speed on the streets indicated in such ordinance. Appropriate signs shall be posted showing such speed limits. 
(e)  The fact that the speed of a vehicle does not exceed the applicable maximum speed limit does not relieve the driver from the duty to decrease speed when approaching and crossing an intersection, when approaching and going around a curve, when approaching a hillcrest, when traveling upon any narrow or winding roadway, or when special hazards exist with respect to pedestrians or other traffic by reason of weather or highway conditions; and speed shall be decreased as may be necessary to avoid colliding with any person or vehicle on or entering the highway in compliance with the legal requirements and the duty of all persons to use due care. 
(f)  It shall be unlawful to drive any vehicle on any street or highway within the city under the jurisdiction of the state department of public works and buildings or of the county at a speed exceeding that lawfully set for such street.

(Ord. No. 01-2011, § 2, 3-8-11) 
Sec. 19-156. - Definitions-Oversized and overweight vehicles. 
    For the purposes of sections 19-157 through 19-162, the following definitions shall apply: 
(a)  A one-way or single trip movement means one (1) move from the point of origin to the point of destination. Any stop between the point of origin and the point of destination are expressly prohibited. Single trip permits are effective for five (5) consecutive days from the date of issuance unless otherwise directed by the village police department. 
(b)  Round-trip movement means a trip from point of origin to the point of destination and back to point of origin over the same route. Round trip permits over a circular or roundabout route will not routinely be issued unless different return routing is necessary due to low clearance or a deficiency in a structure in the opposite direction. Round-trip permits are effective for ten (10) consecutive days from the date of issuance. 
(c)  Multiple movements are those movements by a single permittee involving trips in close proximity to each other in distance and in time. The village police department may, in its sole discretion, consider such multiple movements under a single permit. Such a multiple move permit, when granted by the village police department, may not exceed thirty (30) days from the date of issuance. The precise routes and times must be identified prior to obtaining a permit. 
(d)  Limited continuous use movements are movements generally to one (1) site over a period of three (3) months made by oversized vehicles which do not exceed the weight limits set forth in section 19-157 below. Limited continuous use permits may be used for up to ten (10) trips, generally to the same site during the time period allowed. Each move must be verified by the village police department prior to making the move due to possible lane closures requiring a route change. 
(Ord. No. 01-2011, § 2, 3-8-11) 
Sec. 19-157. - Permits. 
(a)  A permit issued by the village police department shall be required for the movement of any vehicle and/or non-divisible load (one which cannot be reasonably disassembled) or combination of vehicles on any roadway or bridge within the jurisdiction of the village which exceeds the following limits: 
(1)  Maximum gross weight of more than seventy-three thousand two hundred eighty (73,280) pounds. 
(2)  Maximum gross length of more than sixty feet (60'). 
(3)  Maximum gross width of more than eight feet, six inches (8'6"). 
(4)  Maximum gross height of more than thirteen feet, six inches (13'6"). 
(5)  Maximum axle weight of more than eighteen thousand (18,000) pounds. 
(6)  Maximum axle tandem weight of more than thirty-two thousand (32,000) pounds. 
    This shall apply to any single vehicle or vehicles pulled by a single tractor. However, access on village streets within one (1) mile of I-294 and I-80 within village limits is permitted, as required by the Illinois Vehicle Code, to those vehicles meeting maximum weights and dimensions and for those purposes, as the Village Code allows. With respect to those roadways and bridges under construction, road closures with or without signage do not exempt overweight and/or oversized movements from permit requirements when any traffic is allowed through construction zones(s) and when the movement is made by applicant(s) not performing construction on the roadway closed. In an emergency declared by resolution of the village board, the requirements to obtain permits may be waived. 
    The following vehicles are exempt from permits: 
  Fire department vehicles; 
  Those vehicles operating under an emergency declaration; 
  Village-owned vehicles engaged in emergency utility repair; and 
  Equipment used for snow and ice removal, owned or operated by any government body. 
(b)  Permits shall be issued only in the name of the person, firm, business, or corporation that owns and operates the transporting vehicle or that operates the vehicle under a bona fide lease agreement. 
(c)  Permits for vehicles that are both overweight and oversized are valid only one-half (1/2) hour before sunrise until one-half (1/2) hour after sunset, on any day for which the permit is valid. 
(d)  Permits are non-transferable and apply only to the permittee. 
(e)  The village may issue revisions to permits: 
(1)  To correct an error attributed to the village; 
(2)  To correct an error attributed to the applicant, discovered before the move; 
(3)  To adjust weights, dimensions or routes as issued on the permit, before the move is made. 
    Any revisions made at the request of the permittee for purposes of changing weights, dimensions, routes or load descriptions shall be made before any move is made at the cost of ten dollars ($10.00) per permit. 
(f)  The permit, when issued, constitutes an agreement between the permittee and the village that the move described in the application will take place only as described. The permittee has the responsibility to report to the villages police department any inaccuracies or errors on the part of either the village or the permittee before starting any move. Undertaking the move is prima facie evidence of acceptance of the permit as issued and its terms. 
(g)  The routing prescribed in the permit constitutes the sole extent of the authority granted by the permit for the use of village roads, and any vehicle and/or load found to be off route will be considered off route and without a permit. Permits shall be in the drivers possession at all times unless otherwise directed in writing by the village police department and presented upon demand to any and all police officers for the purpose of inspection. 
(h)  If required, arrangement shall be made by the permittee to have the proper utilities notified, property moved, bridges or highways analyses performed and completed in advance of any permit movement. 
(i)  The vehicles and equipment used to move overweight and oversized vehicles under the permit shall be maintained and operated safely, and shall be properly licensed, registered, insured, operated and equipped in accordance with all applicable federal, state and local laws, ordinances, rules and regulations. 
(j)  Permits are void if altered by the permittee. The permits issued under this section constitute the grant of privilege by the village and may be denied or suspended for such reasons as the village may be deemed related to its governmental interests including, but not limited to: 
(1)  A permittees knowingly providing incorrect information in an application for a permit; 
(2)  A permittee, its agents, or employees acting on a permit which has been altered for purposes of deception; 
(3)  Non-compliance by permittee, its agents or employees with federal, state or local ordinances pertaining to the transport of goods or operation of a vehicle engaged in the transport of goods; and/or 
(4)  Moving on village streets without a valid permit as required under this section. 
(Ord. No. 01-2011, § 2, 3-8-11) 
Sec. 19-158. - Application for permit. 
(a)  All applications for permits shall be given full consideration. Permits may be granted only pursuant to a completed application. Permits for the proposed moves may be issued only if the village police department is satisfied that:

(a)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Owner of record of a vehicle means the recorded title holder. 
(b)  Owner liability; exceptions. The owner of any motor vehicle, which vehicle is used during the commission of any of the qualified violations as set forth in section 19-176, shall be liable to the Village of Hazel Crest for an administrative penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00) plus any towing and storage fees applicable to this section. This subsection shall not apply if: 
(1)  The vehicle used in the violation was stolen at the time and the theft was reported to the appropriate police authorities within twenty-four (24) hours after the theft was discovered or reasonably should have been discovered; or 
(2)  The vehicle is operating as a common carrier and the violation occurs without the knowledge of the person in control of the vehicle. 
(c)  Seizure and impoundment. Whenever the Village of Hazel Crest Police Department, or all members thereof assigned to traffic duty, has probable cause to believe that a vehicle is subject to a seizure and impoundment pursuant to this section, the police department shall provide for the towing of the vehicle to a facility controlled by the Village of Hazel Crest or its agents. Before or at the time the vehicle is towed, the police department shall notify any person identifying himself/herself as the owner of the vehicle or any person who is found to be in control of the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation of the fact of the seizure and of the alleged violation and of the vehicle owner's right to request a vehicle impoundment hearing to be conducted under this section. The police department may issue rules and regulations related to this section for enforcement notification procedures and proper forms necessary for administration of this section. 
(d)  Vehicle impoundment hearing. Whenever the owner of record of a vehicle seized pursuant to this section makes a request in person and in writing for a vehicle impoundment hearing within twelve (12) hours after the seizure, a hearing officer of the Village of Hazel Crest shall conduct the vehicle impoundment hearing within twenty-four (24) hours after the seizure, excluding Sundays and legal holidays. All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the vehicle impoundment hearing. The formal and technical rules of evidence shall not apply in the conduct of the hearing. Evidence, including hearsay, may be admitted only if it is a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. If, after the hearing, the hearing officer determines that there is probable cause to believe that the vehicle is subject to seizure and impoundment under subsection (c), the hearing officer shall order the continued impoundment of the vehicle as provided in this section unless the owner of the vehicle posts with the Village of Hazel Crest a cash bond in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00) plus any applicable towing and storage fees. 
(e)  Notification of impoundment; hearing scheduled; failure of owner to appear; determination; penalty. Within ten (10) days after a vehicle is seized and impounded pursuant to this section, the Village of Hazel Crest shall notify by certified mail, return receipt requested, the owner of record of the date, time and location of a hearing that will be conducted pursuant to this section. The hearing shall be scheduled and held, unless continued by order of the hearing officer, no later than thirty (30) days after the vehicle was seized. The hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer of the Village of Hazel Crest. All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at the hearing. If, after the hearing, the hearing officer determines by a preponderance of the evidence that the vehicle violated this section and that none of the exceptions described in subsections (b)(1) and (2) of this section applies, the hearing officer shall enter a default order in favor of the Village of Hazel Crest requiring the payment to the Village of Hazel Crest of an administrative penalty in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00). If the hearing officer finds that no such violation occurred, the hearing officer shall order the immediate return of the owner's vehicle or cash bond. 
(f)  Administrative penalty constitutes debt owing to the Village of Hazel Crest. If an administrative penalty is imposed pursuant to this section, such penalty shall constitute a debt due and owing to the Village of Hazel Crest. If a cash bond has been posted pursuant to this section, the bond shall be applied to the penalty. If a vehicle has been impounded when such a penalty is imposed, the Village of Hazel Crest may seek to obtain judgment against the vehicle or enforce such judgment against the vehicle as provided by law. Except as provided otherwise in this division, a vehicle shall continue to be impounded until: 
(1)  The penalty, plus any applicable towing and storage fees, is paid to the Village of Hazel Crest, in which case possession of the vehicle shall be given to the person who is legally entitled to possess the vehicle; or 
(2)  The vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed of to satisfy a judgment or enforce a lien as provided by law. If the administrative penalty and applicable fees are not paid within thirty (30) days after an administrative penalty is imposed under subsection (e) of this section against an owner of record who defaults by failing to appear at the hearing, the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner provided for by law for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles. In all other cases, if the administrative penalty and applicable fees are not paid within thirty (30) days after the expiration of time at which administrative review of the hearing officer's determination may be sought, or within thirty (30) days after an action seeking administrative review has been resolved in favor of the Village of Hazel Crest, whichever is applicable, the vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles. 
    Except as otherwise specifically provided by law, no owner, lien holder or other person shall be legally entitled to take possession of a vehicle impounded under this section until the civil penalty and fees applicable under this section have been paid. However, whenever a person with a lien of record against an impounded vehicle has commenced foreclosure proceedings, possession of the vehicle shall be given to that person if the person agrees in writing to refund to the Village of Hazel Crest the amount of the net proceeds of any foreclosure sale, less any amounts required to pay all lien holders of record, up to five hundred dollars ($500.00) plus the applicable fees.

A thing is obscene even though the obscenity is latent, as in the case of undeveloped photographs.

    In any prosecution for an offense under this section evidence shall be admissible to show: 
(1)  The character of the audience for which the material was designed or to which it was directed; 
(2)  What the predominant appeal of the material would be for ordinary adults or a special audience, and what effect, if any, it would probably have on the behavior of such people; 
(3)  The artistic, literary, scientific, educational or other merits of the material, or absence thereof; 
(4)  The degree, if any, of public acceptance of the material in this state; 
(5)  Appeal to prurient interest, or absence thereof, in advertising or other promotion of the material;

(d)  Prima facie evidence. The creation, purchase, procurement or possession of a mold, engraved plate or other embodiment of obscenity specially adapted for reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more than three (3) copies of obscene material, shall be prima facie evidence of an intent to disseminate. 
(e)  Affirmative defenses. It shall be an affirmative defense to obscenity that the dissemination: 
(1)  Was not for gain and was made to personal associates other than children under eighteen (18) years of age; 
(2)  Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or other special justification for possession of such material.

(a)  Purpose. The permittee shall establish a security fund in a form and in an amount as set forth in this section. The security fund shall be continuously maintained in accordance with this section at the permittee's sole cost and expense until the completion of the work authorized under the permit. The security fund shall serve as security for: 
(1)  The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this article; 
(2)  Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders, permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this article; and 
(3)  The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance by permittee in violation of this article including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is required by this article to perform that the village must perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to perform or complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to this article or any other applicable law. 
(b)  Form. The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection shall, at a minimum: 
(1)  Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the village and the permittee; 
(2)  Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the village of any amounts covered by it; and 
(3)  Shall provide a location within Cook, McHenry, Lake, Kane, or DuPage counties, Illinois at which it can be drawn. 
(c)  Amount. The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the permit, as determined by the village, and may also include reasonable, directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one (1) location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the village may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the security fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection (c) for any single phase. The security fund for each construction project will be ten dollars ($10.00) per lineal foot of the project, or the company may post a yearly cash retainer or letter of credit for twenty thousand dollars ($20,000.00) (replenished yearly), or a bond for an amount determined by the village, for all construction work to be undertaken that year. 
(d)  Withdrawals. The village, upon fourteen-day advance written notice stating the reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such amount within the fourteen-day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee: 
(1)  Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee hereunder;

Within ninety (90) days following written notice from the village, a utility shall, at is own expense, temporarily or permanently remove, relocate, change or alter the position of any utility facilities within the rights-of-way whenever the corporate authorities have determined that such removal, relocation, change or alteration, is reasonably necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance, or installation of any village improvement in or upon, or the operations of the village in or upon, the rights-of-way. 
(b)  Removal of unauthorized facilities. Within thirty (30) days following written notice from the village, any utility that owns, controls or maintains any unauthorized facility or related appurtenances within the public rights-of-way shall, at its own expense, remove all or any part of such facilities or appurtenances from the public rights-of-way. A facility is unauthorized and subject to removal in the following circumstances: 
(1)  Upon expiration or termination of the permittee's license or franchise, unless otherwise permitted by applicable law; 
(2)  If the facility was constructed or installed without the prior grant of a license or franchise, if required; 
(3)  If the facility was constructed or installed without prior issuance of a required permit in violation of this article; or 
(4)  If the facility was constructed or installed at a location not permitted by the permittee's license or franchise. 
(c)  Emergency removal or relocation of facilities. The village retains the right and privilege to cut or move any facilities located within the rights-of-way of the village, as the village may determine to be necessary, appropriate or useful in response to any public health or safety emergency. If circumstances permit, the municipality shall attempt to notify the utility, if known, prior to cutting or removing a facility and shall notify the utility, if known, after cutting or removing a facility. 
(d)  Abandonment of facilities. Upon abandonment of a facility within the public rights-of-way of the village, the utility shall notify the village within ninety (90) days. Following receipt of such notice the village may direct the utility to remove all or any portion of the facility if the village engineer and/or the director of public works determines that such removal will be in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare. In the event that the village does not direct the utility that abandoned the facility to remove it, by giving notice of abandonment to the village, the abandoning utility shall be deemed to consent to the alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by another utility or person. 
(Ord. No. 10-2007, § 2, 9-11-07; Ord. No. 4-2008, § 2, 2-12-08) 
Sec. 25-119. - Cleanup and restoration. 
    Upon completion of all construction or maintenance of facilities, the utility shall remove all excess material and restore all turf and terrain within ten (10) days, and to the satisfaction of the village. This includes restoration of all disturbed areas. Restoration of roadway surfaces shall be made using materials and methods approved by the village engineer and/or the director of public works. Such cleanup and repair may be required to consist of backfilling, regrading, reseeding, resodding, or any other requirement to restore the right-of-way to a condition substantially equivalent to that which existed prior to the commencement of the project.

(b)  Emergency maintenance procedures. Emergencies may justify noncompliance with normal procedures for securing a permit: 
(1)  If an emergency creates a hazard on the traveled portion of the right-of-way, the utility shall take immediate steps to provide all necessary protection for traffic on the roadway or the public on the right-of-way including the use of signs, lights, barricades or flaggers. If a hazard does not exist on the traveled way, but the nature of the emergency is such as to require the parking on the shoulder of equipment required in repair operations, adequate signs and lights shall be provided. Parking on the shoulder in such an emergency will only be permitted when no other means of access to the facility is available. 
(2)  In an emergency, the utility shall immediately notify the village police department of the situation. This notification shall include a description of the problem, work being undertaken, and what steps have been taken for protection of the traveling public and what will be required to make the necessary repairs. If the nature of the emergency is such as to interfere with the free movement of traffic, the village police department shall be notified immediately. 
(3)  In an emergency, the utility shall use all means at hand to complete repairs as rapidly as practicable and with the least inconvenience to the traveling public.

Sec. 25-121. - Variances. 
(a)  Request for variance. A utility requesting a variance from one (1) or more of the provisions of this article must do so in writing to the director of public works as a part of the permit application. The request shall identify each provision of this article from which a variance is requested and the reasons why a variance should be granted. 
(b)  Authority to grant variances. The village board shall decide whether a variance is authorized for each provision of this article identified in the variance request on an individual basis. 
(c)  Conditions for granting of variance. The village board may authorize a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that: 
(1)  One (1) or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as terrain features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special hardship that would make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public purposes to be achieved by the provision; and 
(2)  All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that would conform with the provision from which a variance is requested are impracticable in relation to the requested approach. 
(d)  Additional conditions for granting of a variance. As a condition for authorizing a variance, the village board may require the utility requesting the variance to meet reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be expressly contained within this article but which carry out the purposes of this article.

    Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with any of the provisions of this article shall be subject to fine in accordance with the penalty provisions of this Code. There may be times when the village will incur delay or other costs, including third party claims, because the utility will not or cannot perform its duties under its permit and this article. Unless the utility shows that another allocation of the cost of undertaking the requested action is appropriate, the utility shall bear the village's costs of damages and its costs of installing, maintaining, modifying, relocating, or removing the facility that is the subject of the permit. No other administrative agency or commission may review or overrule a permit-related cost appointment of the village. Sanctions may be imposed upon a utility who does not pay the costs apportioned to it.

ARTICLE VII. - OUTDOOR NIGHT LIGHTING[3] 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Section 1 of Ord. No. 17-2007, adopted Oct. 9, 2007, enacted provisions designated as §§ 25-99-25-110. Inasmuch as there already exists sections so designated, said provisions have been renumbered as §§ 25-131-25-142 to avoid duplication of numbers. 

Sec. 25-131. - Definitions. 
    The following definitions shall apply in the interpretation and enforcement of this article: 
    Direct light: Light emitted directly from the lamp, off of the reflector or reflector diffuser, or through the refractor or diffuser lens of a luminaire. 
    Fixture: The assembly that houses the lamp or lamps and can include all or some of the following parts: a housing, a mounting bracket or pole socket, a lamp holder, a ballast, a reflector or mirror, and/or a refractor or lens. 
    Floodlight or spotlight: Any light fixture or lamp that incorporates a reflector or a refractor to concentrate the light output into a directed beam in a particular direction. 
    Fully-shielded lights: Outdoor light fixtures shielded or constructed so that no light rays are emitted by the installed fixture at angles above the horizontal plane as certified by a photometric test report. 
    Glare: Light emitting from a luminaire with an intensity great enough to reduce a viewer's ability to see, and in extreme cases, to cause momentary blindness. 
    Grandfathered luminaires: Luminaires not conforming to this article that were in place at the time this article was voted into effect. When an ordinance "grandfathers" a luminaire, it means that such already-existing outdoor lighting does not need to be changed unless a period is specified for adherence to the article. 
    Height of luminaire: The height of a luminaire shall be the vertical distance from the ground directly below the centerline of the luminaire to the lowest direct-light-emitting part of the luminaire. 
    Indirect light: Direct light that has been reflected or has scattered off of other surfaces. 
    Lamp: The component of a luminaire that produces the actual light. 
    Light trespass: The shining of a light produced by a luminaire beyond the boundaries of the property on which it is located. 
    Outdoor lighting: The night-time illumination of an outside area or object by any manmade device located outdoors that produces light by any means. 
    Temporary outdoor lighting: The specific illumination of an outside area or object by any manmade device located outdoors that produces light by any means for a period of less than seven (7) days, with at least one hundred eighty (180) days passing before being used again.

Any amounts payable to the village pursuant to this subsection (g) shall be paid to the village within twenty-one (21) days after the date of issuance of an invoice for same.

(2)  Tow not authorized. There was no authorization in law for the towing and storage of the vehicle, or the municipal employee causing the vehicle to be towed did not comply with the requirements of the statute or ordinance authorizing the tow; 
(3)  Tow authorized; storage reimbursable. The towing of the vehicle was authorized by law, but the owner was caused to incur additional storage charges because of late notification of towing or other reasons not the fault of the owner. The specific amount owed by the owner, and the specific amount excused, shall be stated in the decision; 
(4)  Owner failed to appear; no continuance requested. A hearing was requested but the person requesting the hearing failed to appear and failed to request a continuance.

(f)  Actions by hearing officer upon conclusion of hearing. The hearing officer shall advise the owner of his findings at the conclusion of the hearing, and take the following actions: 
(1)  If the towing and storage was found to be authorized by law, and is not otherwise reimbursable, the owner shall be so informed and further advised as to the amount then due for towing and storage if the vehicle has remained impounded;

6.  Unless the municipality files a lawsuit to contest the decision of the hearing officer, the owner shall be paid the money due within twenty-eight (28) days after the decision of the hearing officer. 
b.  If the vehicle is still in the possession of the towing company at the time of the hearing, the following procedure shall be followed: 
1.  An order for the release of the vehicle shall be prepared in duplicate; the owner shall be provided with the original, and a copy shall be attached to the post-tow hearing decision; 
2.  Upon presentation by the owner to the towing company of the order for release, said vehicle shall immediately be released to the owner without payment of any service charges excused by the hearing decision. 
(3)  All originals or copies of the notices, post-tow hearing decisions, towing reports, and any associated police reports or documents shall be retained by the police department for a period as may be required by law; 
(4)  The municipality or the owner may contest the decision of the hearing officer in any manner provided by law.

Editor's note- Ordinance No. 17-1989, adopted May 23, 1989, amended Ch. 29, but did not specify the manner of codification. Inclusion of Arts. I-III and Art. V as §§ 29-91-29-94 was made at the discretion of the editor. Articles IV and VI were omitted to avoid duplication of §§ 1-9 and 1-6, respectively. 

Sec. 29-91. - User charges. 
(a)  Basis for wastewater service charges. The wastewater service charge for the use and for service supplied by the wastewater facilities of the village shall consist of a basic user charge for operation and maintenance plus replacement, and a capital improvement charge. 
    The debt service and capital improvements charge is computed by apportioning the annual debt service and capital improvements costs on a per one thousand (1,000) gallons basis. 
    The basic user charge shall be based on water usage as recorded by water meters. 
    It shall consist of operation and maintenance costs plus replacement and shall be computed as follows: 
(1)  Estimate the projected annual revenue required to operate and maintain the wastewater collection facilities including a replacement fund for the year, for all works categories. 
(2)  Proportion the estimated OM&R costs to each user class by volume. 
(3)  Compute costs per one thousand (1,000) gallons. 
    The adequacy of the wastewater service charge shall be reviewed, not less often than annually, by certified public accountants for the village in their annual audit report. The wastewater service charge shall be revised periodically to reflect a change in local capital costs or a change in operation and maintenance costs including replacement costs. 
    The users of wastewater treatment services will be notified annually, in conjunction with a regular bill, of the rate and that portion of the user charges which are attributable to the wastewater treatment operation, maintenance and replacement. 
(b)  Measurement of flow. The volume of flow used for computing basic user charges and surcharges shall be the metered water consumption read to the lowest even increments of one thousand (1,000) gallons. 
    If the person discharging wastes into the public sewers procures any part, or all, of his water from sources other than the public waterworks system, all or a part of which is discharged into the public sewers, the person shall install and maintain, at his expense, water meters of a type approved by the village for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained from these other sources. 
    Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be required by the village if these volumes cannot otherwise be determined from the metered water consumption records. 
    Metering devices for determining the volume of waste shall be installed, owned, and maintained by the person. Following approval and installation, such meters may not be removed, unless service is cancelled, without the consent of the village. 
(c)  Debt service and capital improvements charge. A debt service and capital improvement charge per one thousand (1,000) gallons as defined in subsection (a) herein to each user of the wastewater collection facilities is hereby established. 
(d)  Basic user rate. There shall be and there is hereby established a minimum charge and a basic user rate for the use of and for service supplied by the wastewater facilities of the village. 
    A minimum charge per one thousand (1,000) per quarter shall be applied to all users whose water consumption does not exceed five thousand (5,000) gallons per quarter. 
    A basic user rate per one thousand (1,000) gallons as defined in subsection (a) herein shall be applied to all users for water consumption in excess of five thousand (5,000) gallons per quarter. 
    All nonmetered residential users of the wastewater facilities shall pay a minimum flat rate charge of eleven dollars ($11.00) per quarter adequate to cover the costs of the minimum accrual capital cost charge, the minimum service charge and the basic user rate. The flat rate charge will allow a maximum of twenty two thousand (22,000) gallons per quarter. 
    In the event use of the wastewater facilities is determined by the village to be in excess of five thousand (5,000) gallons per quarter, the village may require such flat rate user to install metering devices on the water supply or sewer main to measure the amount of service supplied. 
(e)  Computation of wastewater service charge. The wastewater service charge shall be computed annually by the following formula: 
CW = CM + (Vu-X) (CU + CD) 
    Where: 
CW = Amount of waste service charge ($) per billing period. CM = Minimum charge for operation, maintenance and replacement. Vu = Wastewater volume for the billing period. X = Allowable consumption in gallons for the minimum charge. CU = Basic user rate for operation, maintenance and replacement. CD = Debt service and capital improvement charge subsection (c).  
(Ord. No. 17-1989, Art. I, 5-23-89) 
Sec. 29-92. - General provisions. 
(a)  Bills. Said rates or charges for service shall be payable quarterly except in cases where the village determines that circumstances warrant monthly billing. The owner of the premises, the occupant thereof and the user of the service shall be jointly and severally liable to pay for the service to such premises and the service is furnished to the premises by the village only upon the condition that the owner of the premises, occupant and user of the services are jointly and severally liable therefor to the village. 
    Bills for sewer service shall be sent out by the water accounts clerk within thirty (30) days of the month succeeding the period for which the service is billed. 
    All sewer bills are due and payable thirty (30) days after being sent out. A penalty of ten (10) per cent shall be added to all bills not paid by the thirtieth day after they have been rendered. 
(b)  Delinquent bills. If the charges for such services are not paid within sixty (60) days after the rendition of the bill for such services, such services shall be discontinued without further notice and shall not be reinstated until all claims are settled. 
(c)  Lien; notice of delinquency. Whenever a bill for sewer service remains unpaid for sixty (60) days after it has been rendered, the village treasurer shall file with the county recorder of deeds a statement of lien claim. This statement shall contain the legal description of the premises served, the amount of the unpaid bill, and a notice that the village claims a lien for this amount as well as for all charges subsequent to the period covered by the bill. 
    If the user whose bill is unpaid is not the owner of the premises and the village treasurer has notice of this, notice shall be mailed to the owner of the premises if his address be known to the treasurer, whenever such bill remains unpaid for the period sixty (60) days after it has been rendered. 
    The failure of the village treasurer to record such lien or to mail such notice or the failure of the owner to receive such notice shall not affect the right to foreclose the lien for unpaid bills as mentioned in the foregoing section. 
(d)  Foreclosure of lien. Property subject to a lien for unpaid charges shall be sold for non-payment of the same, and the proceeds of the sale shall be applied to pay the charges, after deducting costs, as is the case in the foreclosure of statutory liens. Such foreclosure shall be by bill-in equity in the name of the village. The village attorney is hereby authorized and directed to institute such proceedings in the name of the village in any court having jurisdiction over such matters against any property for which the bill has remained unpaid sixty (60) days after it has been rendered. 
(e)  Revenues. All revenues and moneys derived from the operation of the sewerage system shall be deposited in the sewerage account of the water/sewerage fund. All such revenues and moneys shall be held by the village treasurer separate and apart from his private funds and separate and apart from all other funds of the village and all of said sum, without any deductions whatever, shall be delivered to the village treasurer not more than ten (10) days after receipt of the same, or at such more frequent intervals as may from time to time be directed by the president and board of trustees. 
    The village treasurer shall receive all such revenues from the sewerage system and all other funds and moneys incident to the operation of such system as the same may be delivered to him and deposit the same in the account of the fund designated as the "Sewerage Fund of the Village of Hazel Crest."

Section III. - General requirements for the subdivision of land. 
a.  General principles of acceptability. 
1.  Conformance to Official Plan: The subdivision shall conform to the official Plan or existing portions thereof, and shall not encroach upon areas designated in the Official Plan for future public facilities. 
2.  Provision for future subdivision: If a tract is subdivided into larger parcels than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged to allow the opening of future streets and logical further subdivision. 
3.  Reserve strips prohibited: There shall be no reservations of strips of land that prevent or unreasonably limit access to land dedicated or intended to be dedicated to public use. 
4.  Buffer planting strips: Where a residential subdivision adjoins a railroad right-of-way, an industrial area, a business area or other land use which would have a depreciating effect on the residential use of the property, a buffer planting strip ten (10) to fifteen (15) feet in width and suitably planted to form a screen may be required by the Plan Commission. 
5.  Building sites: Every lot must contain a suitable building site. 
6.  Trees: Valuable large trees shall be preserved whenever possible. Where planting strips are provided with trees, such trees shall not be of a low bush species that might obstruct vision. 
7.  Variations and exceptions: Variations and exceptions from the design and dimensional standards and improvement requirements of these regulations may be made by the Plan Commission in cases where, owing to exceptional conditions, there are extreme difficulties or hardships in the way of carrying out the strict letter of these regulations. Resubdivision of a single lot of a platted block of an old subdivision shall be considered as an exceptional condition meriting departure from the strict letter of these regulations. 
b.  Streets (layout and design). 
1.  Conformance to Official Plan: The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all streets shall conform to the Official Plan and shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets. 
2.  Major streets: Wherever a subdivision embraces a major street, as shown on the Official Plan, such major street shall be platted substantially in the location indicated on the Official Street Plan. 
3.  Collector streets: Collector streets shall be included when it is apparent that sufficient traffic will flow from the minor streets within the subdivision and that such traffic will need to be channeled in control of the number of access points to the major street. Whenever a subdivision embraces a collector street, as shown on the Official Plan, such collector street shall be plated substantially in the location indicated on the Official Plan. 
4.  Street layout: The street layout shall be devised for the most advantageous development of the entire neighborhood area. Where necessary to the neighborhood pattern, existing principal streets in adjoining subdivisions shall be continued and shall be at least as wide as such existing streets and in alignment with them. The street layout shall provide for the future projection of the principal streets into unsubdivided lands adjoining. 
5.  Minor streets: Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be discouraged. 
6.  Intersections: There shall be a minimum number of intersections of minor streets with major streets. 
7.  Marginal-access streets: Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major street, the Plan Commission may require marginal-access streets, reverse frontage with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the rear property line or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through local traffic. 
8.  Streets for use adjacent to railroad or major streets: Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way or major street, the Plan Commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right-of-way or major street, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land. Such distances shall also be determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separations. 
9.  Street jogs: Street jogs with center line offsets of less than one hundred and twenty-five (125) feet shall be avoided. 
10.  Streets at business centers: In front of areas zoned or designed for commercial use the street width and the roadway width shall be increased on the side or sides on which the property for commercial use is located by a merging lane at least fifteen (15) feet wide. This is to insure the free flow of traffic without interference by vehicles entering or leaving parking areas. This is not a parking space requirement and shall in no way affect or diminish requirements by the zoning ordinance or otherwise for off-street parking facilities; neither shall fulfillment of this requirement and its acceptance by the Plan Commission be deemed approval or endorsement of any change in zoning necessary for such commercial use. 
11.  Alleys: Paved rear alleys not less than twenty-four (24) feet wide will be required in all business and industrial districts of subdivisions except where special conditions make alleys impracticable; in such cases adequate off-street loading space, suitably surfaced, shall be provided. Dead-end alleys shall be avoided, or, if provided, [shall] include a turnaround. Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment shall be avoided, but where necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently to permit safe vehicular movement. Alleys will not be approved for residential districts of subdivisions unless necessary because of topography or other unusual circumstances. 
12.  Half streets: Half streets shall be prohibited. However, if an existing half street is adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be platted within such tract. 
13.  Cul-de-sacs: Dead-end streets, designed to be so permanently, shall not be longer than five hundred (500) feet, and shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround having an outside roadway diameter of ninety-six (96) feet back-to-back of curb. The right-of-way diameter at the turnaround shall be one hundred twenty-five (125) feet. 
14.  Right-of-way widths: The minimum right-of-way widths for streets, alleys and crosswalkways shall be: 
Feet Major street (except in cases where a greater or lesser width is shown on the Official Plan) 100 Collector street 66 Minor street 60 Cul-de-sac 60 Marginal-access street 50 Alley (in business and industrial district) 24 Crosswalkway 10  
15.  Roadway widths (outside to outside of curbs): 
Feet Major street, to be set by Plan Commission as required. Collector street 38 Minor street 28 Cul-de-sac 28 Marginal-access street 28 Alley (in business or industrial district), minimum 24 Crosswalkway, minimum 5 Sidewalks (in residential areas), minimum 4 Sidewalk (in business areas) to be set by the Plan Commission.  
16.  Curvature of streets: The minimum radius of horizontal curvature of streets at the center line shall be: 
Feet Major street 600 Collector street 300 Minor street 100 Cul-de-sac 100  
17.  Reversed curves: Between reversed curves on major and secondary streets there shall be a tangent at least one hundred (100) feet long. 
18.  Intersections: Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as possible at right angles and no street shall intersect any other street at less than sixty (60) degrees. 
19.  Street grades: Unless necessitated by unusual topography, street grades shall conform in general to the terrain and shall be not less than one (1) per cent. Street grades shall not be more than six (6) per cent for major and collector, or ten (10) per cent for minor and marginal-access streets. Street grades shall be such as to provide natural surface drainage of storm water regardless of the presence of absence of storm sewers. The intent is to avoid depressions or inverts that will flood in flash storms for which storm sewers are inadequate. 
20.  Rate of change of street grades: There shall be no abrupt change of grade in streets. For major and collector streets, the algebraic difference in per cent grade between any two (2) points shall be no greater than 1/15 of the horizontal distance between the two (2) points. For all other streets and alleys, 1/15 is replaced by 2/15 . 
21.  Curb radii: The horizontal radius of curvature of curbs shall not be less than twenty (20) feet. 
22.  Location of sidewalks: The inner edge of public sidewalks shall be located not less than eleven (11) inches nor more than thirteen (13) inches from the edge of the right-of-way. 
c.  Blocks. 
1.  General considerations: The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to: 
(a)  Provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated; 
(b)  Zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions; 
(c)  Needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic; 
(d)  Limitations and opportunities of topography. 
2.  Lengths of blocks: Blocks shall not exceed fifteen hundred (1,500) feet in length; blocks longer than nine hundred (900) feet in length may be required to have crosswalkways. 
3.  Blocks for industrial or commercial use: Blocks intended for industrial or commercial use shall be designed specifically for such purpose, with adequate space set aside for off-street parking and loading. 
4.  Blocks on major streets: It is preferred that blocks adjacent to major streets be so arranged that the long dimension of the block be parallel to the major street and that lots do not front on or have access to the major street. Where this arrangement is not feasible, marginal-access streets may be required. 
d.  Lots. 
1.  General considerations: The lot size, width, depth, shape and orientation shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the type of development and use contemplated. 
2.  Minimum width and area: Lots for residential use shall be at least sixty (60) feet wide at the building setback line and shall be at least seventy-two hundred (7,200) square feet in area; corner lots seventy (70) feet minimum frontage, eighty-four hundred (8,400) square feet minimum area. Residential lots served by septic systems shall be a minimum of two hundred (200) feet wide at the building setback line and shall have a minimum area and depth as determined by specifications for seepage systems recommended by the Cook County Department of Public Health, provided further that no such lot shall have an area less than twenty thousand (20,000) square feet. 
3.  Maximum depth: The maximum depth of any lot, exclusive of unusable land, shall be three and one-half (31/2) times the width of the lot at the building setback line. 
4.  Lot [to] abut on street: Every lot shall abut on a dedicated and improved street for at least twenty-five (25) feet. 
5.  Building setback lines: Minimum setback from property lines in residential zones shall conform with the zoning regulations, provided further that: 
(a)  Minimum front setback from property line in residential zones shall be no less than twenty-five (25) feet. 
(b)  Minimum back setback from property lines in residential zones shall be no less than three (3) feet. 
(c)  There shall be a minimum setback from the outside wall line to each side lot line of six (6) feet. Furthermore, a minimum horizontal distance of four (4) feet must be maintained between any part of a structure and any side lot line. If a garage is located entirely on the rear half of the lot, the minimum setback from the outside wall line of the garage shall be three (3) feet. 
6.  Corner lots: Corner lots in residential zones shall be considered as having frontage on both streets and shall conform with the minimum setback lines on both streets. 
7.  Concrete monuments: Concrete monuments shall be installed adjacent to each rear lot corner, and at such other points where a change in grade occurs. The monuments shall be poured in place with a six (6) bag mix concrete, in a six (6) inch diameter augured posthole, to a finished depth of four (4) feet. The finish grade of the monument shall be established by the Village Engineer. (Ord. No. 23-1968, 11-12-68) 
8.  Property lines at corners: Property lines at street intersection corners shall be arcs concentric with curb arcs. 
9.  Sidelines of lots: Sidelines of lots shall be approximately at right angles or radial to the street line. 
10.  Double-frontage lots: Double-frontage and reverse-frontage lots shall be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. A planting screen easement of at least ten (10) feet, and across which there shall be no right of access, shall be provided along the line of lots abutting such a traffic artery or other disadvantageous use. 
11.  Grading for storm water: Lots and blocks shall be so graded as to provide adequately for storm water drainage. Where storm water is collected or drained by a drainage swale in the rear or side yard of a lot or along the rear yards or side yards of a block, to a collector structure or a point of discharge, the minimum grade of the flow line of said drainage swale shall be .75 foot per hundred feet or .75%. The subdivider shall submit working drawings showing contours to which the property is to be graded; such approved and installed grade and flow line shall be indicated on the "as built" drawing. (Ord. No. 11-1974, 3-12-74) 
e.  Public property. 
1.  Dedication of park lands and school sites or for payments of fees in lieu thereof. As a condition of approval of a final plant of subdivision, or of a final plat of a planned unit development, each subdivider or developer will be required to dedicate land for park and recreational purposes and land for school sites, to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the development, or cash contribution in lieu of actual land dedication, or a combination of both, at the option of the village, in accordance with the following criteria and formula: 
a.  Criteria for requiring park and recreational land dedication: 
(1)  Requirement and population ratio. The ultimate density of a proposed development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required for dedication. The total requirement shall be five and one-half (5.5) acres of land per one thousand (1,000) of ultimate population in accordance with the following classification: 
Types of Recreation Area Size Range Minimum Acres Per 1,000 People (a)  Play lot Minimum 8,000 square feet Not Applicable (b)  School-park (neighborhood play-ground) Minimum Park of 5 acres 1.25 (c)  Neighborhood park Minimum 31/2 acres 1.0 (d)  District-wide park or playfield Minimum 4 acres up to 30 acres 1.25 (e)  Community wide recreation park Minimum 12 acres up to 30 acres  2.0  5.5 acres Total: of land per 1,000 people  
(2)  Location. A park site of not less than five (5) acres shall be required adjoining each elementary school site. A central location which will serve equally the entire development is most desirable. In large developments, these sites can be located throughout the development according to established standards for park area distances. 
(3)  Credit for private open spaces and recreation areas. When subdividers or developers provide their own open space for recreation areas and facilities, it has the effect of reducing the demand for local public recreational services. Depending upon the size of the development, a portion of the park and recreation area in subdivisions or planned unit developments may, at the option of the president and board of trustees, be provided in the form of "private" open space in lieu of dedicated "public" open space. The extent of same shall be determined by the president and board of trustees, based upon the needs of the projected residents and in conformance to the total park and recreational land for the general area. 
In general, a substitution of private open space for dedicated parks will imply a substantially higher degree of improvement and the installation of recreational facilities, including equipment by the developer as part of his obligation. Detailed plans of such areas, including specifications of facilities to be installed, must be approved by the village, and before any credit is given for private recreation areas, the subdivider or developer must guarantee that these private recreation areas will be permanently maintained for such use by the execution of the appropriate legal documents. Private "swimming clubs" are included in this provision. When an adjustment for private, recreation areas is warranted, it will be necessary to compute the total park land dedication that would have been required from the subdivision or planned unit development and then subtract the credit to be given. 
b.  Criteria for requiring school site dedication: 
(1)  Requirement and population ratio. The ultimate number of students to be generated by a subdivision or planned unit development shall bear directly upon the amount of land required to be dedicated for school sites. The land dedication requirement shall be determined by obtaining the ratio of: 
(a)  Estimated number of children to be generated from the subdivision in each such school classification over the; 
(b)  Maximum recommended number of students to be served in each such school classification as stated herein, and then applying such ratio to the; 
(c)  Minimum recommended number of acres for a school site of each such school classification as stated herein. 
    The product thereof shall be the acres of land required to be dedicated to serve the estimated increased children in each such school classification. 
(2)  School classifications and size of school site. School classifications and size of school sites within the village shall be determined in accordance with the following criteria: 
School Classification by Grades Maximum Number of Students for each such School Classification Minimum Number of Acres of Land for each School Site of Such Classification Elementary schools, grades kindergarten through fifth (K-5) or kindergarten through sixth (K-6) 600 students 10 acres Junior high school, grades 6th through 8th or 7th through 9th 1,200 students 22 acres High schools, grades 9th through 12th or 10th through 12th 2,500 students 50 acres  
(3)  Location. The comprehensive school plan and/or the standards adopted by the affected school district shall be used as a guideline in locating sites. 
c.  Criteria for requiring a contribution in lieu of park and school sites: Where the development is small and the resulting site is too small to be practical, or when the available land is inappropriate for park and recreational purposes or a school site, the village shall require the subdivider or developer to pay a cash contribution, calculated as provided herein, in lieu of the land dedication required. The cash contributions in lieu of park and recreation land dedication shall be held in trust by the village, or other public body when so designated by the village, solely for the acquisition of park and recreation land, which will be available to serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or development or for the improvement of other existing local park and recreation land which already serves such needs. The cash contributions in lieu of school sites shall be held in trust by the village, solely for use in the acquisition of land for a school site to serve the immediate or future needs of children from that development or for the improvement to any existing school site which already serves such needs, but not for the construction of any school buildings or additions thereto. Expenditures from school site funds held in trust shall be made only with the mutual agreement of the village and the affected school district. The affected district shall furnish the village with a written notice describing the amount, purpose and time of any proposed expenditure of school site trust funds. Within forty-five (45) days from receipt of said notice, the village shall advise the said school district whether or not the village is in agreement with the proposed expenditure. If any disagreement exists, the village shall designate a committee to meet with representatives of the affected school district to resolve the matter. If any portion of a cash contribution in lieu of park and recreation land dedication, or cash contribution in lieu of school site is not expended for the purposes set forth herein within ten (10) years from the date of receipt, it shall be refunded to the developer who made such contribution. 
(1)  Fair market value. The cash contributions in lieu of land shall be based on the fair market value of the acres of land in the area improved as specified herein that otherwise would have been dedicated as park and recreation and school sites. The fair market value of such improved land shall be determined in the following manner: 
(a)  The village president and board of trustees shall name an appraiser who shall make an appraisal of the fair market value of such acres of land on behalf of the village; 
(b)  The subdivider or developer shall name an appraiser to make such an appraisal on behalf of the subdivider or developer; 
(c)  The two (2) appraisers named by the village, and the subdivider or developer, shall name a third appraiser to make such an appraisal of the property; 
(d)  In the event that the two (2) appraisers are not able to agree upon a third appraiser, the third appraiser shall be appointed by the chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division; 
(e)  All appraisers that shall be appointed shall be MAI appraisers who shall issue bonafide appraisals of the fair market value of the land in question as if it were improved in accordance with the provisions of the Hazel Crest Subdivision Control Regulations. 
(f)  The "fair market value" for the purpose of calculating cash contributions in lieu of land shall be the average value of the acres as appraised by all three appraisers. 
(2)  Criteria for requiring dedication and a fee. There will be situations in subdivision or planned unit developments when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both necessary. These occasions will arise when: 
(a)  Only a portion of the land to be developed is proposed as the location for a park or school site. That portion of the land within the subdivision falling within the park or school location shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated; 
(b)  A major part of the local park or recreation site or school site has already been acquired, and only a small portion of land is needed from the development to complete the site. The remaining portions shall be required by dedication, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall be required. 
d.  Density formula: The following table of population density is generally indicative of current and short-range projected trends in family size for new construction and shall be used in calculating the amount of required dedication of acres of land or the cash contributions in lieu thereof unless a written objection is filed thereto by the subdivider or developer:

In the event a subdivider or developer files a written objection to the Table of Estimated Ultimate Population listed herein, he shall submit his own demographic study showing the estimated additional population to be generated from the subdivision or planned unit development and in that event, final determination of the density formula to be used in such calculations shall be made by the president and board of trustees, based upon such demographic information submitted by the subdivider or developer and from other sources which may be submitted to the president and board of trustees by the school district or others. It is recognized that population density, age distribution and local conditions change over the years, and the specific formula for the dedication of land, or the payment of fees in lieu thereof, as stated herein, is subject to periodic review and amendment, if necessary. 
e.  Example of calculation of required dedication or fees in lieu thereof: The following example illustrates the operation of the formula for dedication of a school site or payment of fees in lieu thereof. Assuming a development or subdivision consisting of one hundred (100) detached single-family houses, consisting of fifty (50) three-bedroom houses and fifty (50) four-bedroom houses, and an elementary school district operating a kindergarten through sixth and seventh through ninth junior high program, the required dedication of land would be calculated as follows: 
PARK AND RECREATION LAND 
Quantity and Type of Units Total Population 50 3-bedroom detached houses × 3.446 = 172.3 50 4-bedroom detached houses × 4.032 = 201.6 Total population produced 373.9 Park and recreation land donation = 373.9 1000 × 5.5 acres = 2.056 acres  
SCHOOL SITE DONATION 
Quantity and Type of Units Quantity K-6 Children Produced Quantity 7-9 Junior High Children Produced Quantity 10-12 High School Children Produced 50 3-bedroom houses × 0.67 = 33.5 × 0.25 = 12.5 × 0.22 = 11.0 50 4-bedroom houses × 0.77 = 38.5 × 0.36 = 18.0 × 0.31 = 15.5 Total Children Produced 72.0 30.5 26.5 Kindergarten through sixth school donation 72.0 children 
600 children × 10 acres = 1.2 acres Junior high, seventh through ninth school donation 30.5 children 
1,200 children × 22 acres = .559 acres High school donation 26.5 children 
2,500 children × 50 acres = .53 acres Total Acres: 2.289  
If fees in lieu of the land donation are to be used, and assuming the fair market value of the land is determined to be fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00) per acre, the total cash donation shall be determined as follows: 
PARK AND RECREATION LAND DONATION 
Total number of acres as determined above 2.056 × $15,000 per acre = $30,850 total cash contribution required  
SCHOOL SITE DONATION 
Total number of acres as determined above 2.289 × $15,000 per acre = $34,335 total cash contribution required  
f.  Reservation of additional land: Where the comprehensive plan or the standards of the village call for a larger amount of park and recreational land or school sites in a particular subdivision or planned unit development than the developer is required to dedicate, the land needed beyond the developer's contribution shall be designated and reserved for subsequent purchase at "fair market value" or acquisition through condemnation by the village or other public body determined by the village, provided that such purchase is made or proceedings commenced to acquire the land so designated within one year from the date of approval of the final plat. 
g.  Combining with adjoining developments: Where the subdivision or planned unit development is less than forty (40) acres, public open space or a school site which is to be dedicated should, where possible, be combined with dedications from adjoining developments in order to produce usable recreation areas or school sites without hardship on a particular developer. 
h.  Topography and grading: The topography and geology of the dedicated site, as well as its surroundings, must be suitable for its intended purposes. Grading on sites dedicated shall be consistent with those purposes. 
i.  Improved sites: All sites shall be dedicated in a condition ready for full service of electrical, gas, water, sewer, sidewalk, streets and storm drainage, where those services are included in the development and as applicable to the location of the site, and acceptable provision made therefor. 
j.  Time for conveyance of dedicated lands and payment of fees in lieu thereof: Land required to be dedicated herein shall be conveyed at the final plat stage, or within a reasonable time thereafter as permitted by the village, by warranty or trustees deed free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, except current real estate taxes and customary title company exceptions. Fees in lieu of such land dedications calculated as provided herein shall be paid as a condition of final plat approval. Real estate taxes not yet due at the time of such conveyance and any real estate taxes thereafter due by reason of the change of the use of the property from farming or agricultural purposes under Chapter 120, section 501a-3, Illinois Revised Statutes, shall be paid by the developer when the same shall become due. Sufficient guarantees of the payment of such taxes shall be provided to the village as a condition of final plat approval. (Ord. No. 13-1978, § 1, 4-25-78) 
2.  Natural and cultural features: Outstanding natural and cultural features, such as scenic spots and watercourses, shall be preserved insofar as possible. 
3.  Easements: Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, an appropriate easement shall be provided for the watercourse in either an open cut or in an underground conduit, depending upon the density of development. Where water mains, sanitary sewers, storm sewers, gas mains, telephone lines, power lines or other utilities are located on or adjacent to property lines, adequate easements together with right of ingress or egress thereto and therefrom, shall be provided and platted. Easements shall not be less than ten (10) feet in width and shall be centered upon the center line of the utility. Where more than one utility is to occupy the easement, the easement shall be of such width as to extend five (5) feet at each side beyond the center lines of the outermost utilities. Additional width shall be provided where necessary to accommodate utility pole bracing, sewer or water lines. The Plan Commission may require evidence of approval by the public utility company of easement width. Where side lot easements occur adjacent to a driveway, there shall not be less than ten (10) feet clearance between the easement line and the extreme projection of the building structure. 
3a.  [Underground placement of utilities:] All utilities serving subdivisions hereinafter approved and accepted by the Village of Hazel Crest, shall be placed underground in accordance with the Rules and Regulations of the Public Utility Companies, approved and accepted by the Illinois Commerce Commission. (Ord. No. 2-1969, § I, 1-28-69) 
4.  Names: The name of the subdivision and new street names shall not duplicate, nor too closely approximate phonetically, the name of any other subdivision or street within or near the Village of Hazel Crest. Street names shall be subject to the approval of the Village Clerk. 
f.  Improvements. 
1.  Working drawings and specifications required: Before considering the approval of the final plat for any subdivision, the Plan Commission will require four (4) complete sets of working drawings and four (4) copies of specifications, and cost estimates for all improvements contemplated by the final plat. 
2.  Source of drawings and specifications: The subdivider shall have working drawings, specifications and cost estimates for improvements prepared by a registered professional engineer. 
3.  Permission required: Specific permission of the Board of Trustees shall be obtained before commencement of construction of any improvement. Approval of the final plat by the Board of Trustees shall constitute permission to proceed with construction providing the plat is accepted for recording by the County Recorder. If the subdivider desires to construct an improvement prior to approval of the final plat, the Board of Trustees may extend permission to proceed upon recommendation of the Plan Commission together with certification that proper working drawings and specifications have been prepared and approved by the Plan Commission. Under these circumstances approval of final plat shall be contingent upon a favorable inspection report. 
4.  Other permission: The subdivider shall also obtain any permission required by law of State and County officials and permission extended by the Board of Trustees shall not relieve the subdivider of responsibility to secure State and County approval. 
5.  Types of improvements: The design, layout and carrying capacities of storm water, sanitary sewer, and water facilities shall recognize the future requirements of adjacent undeveloped areas. The following improvements shall be required: 
Street and alley grading and surfacing, curbs and gutters; 
Grading and surfacing of off-street parking space; 
Sidewalks; 
Sanitary sewage facilities; 
Water mains and hydrants; 
Storm water drainage facilities; 
Street signs; 
Streetlights; 
Driveways; 
Survey monuments; 
Compacted fill. 
6.  Hazel Crest standards: All improvements shall be in accordance with Village of Hazel Crest standards and requirements as given in ordinances and regulations in effect at the time of submission of the final plat. 
7.  Inspection required: All improvements shall be subject to inspection on behalf of the Village by a duly authorized and qualified inspector, both during the course of construction and after construction is complete. The inspector shall have authority over materials of construction, methods of construction and workmanship to insure compliance with work[ing] drawings and specifications. The contractor shall provide for reasonable tests and proof of quality of materials as requested by the inspector. Upon due cause, the inspector may require that work be suspended and the due cause shall include weather conditions, questionable materials of construction, methods of construction, workmanship or nonadherence to specifications and drawings. 
    Inspection by closed circuit television shall be required prior to approval and acceptance by the Village of all sanitary and storm sewers. All costs for said inspection shall be paid by the developer. The Superintendent of Public Works shall evaluate the reports and photographs obtained thereby. If said photographs and evidence show the sewer main to be free from engineering defect and foreign substance and show that it meets all other approved engineering standards, the superintendent of public works shall approve the mains for acceptance by the Village. If not, he shall direct such remedial activity as is necessary to be done prior to the acceptance of said mains. All photographs and reports obtained as a result of said inspection shall be the property of the Village of Hazel Crest. 
    The Village shall be reimbursed monthly by the subdivider for inspections according to the following schedule, provided, however, that the total cost to the subdivider under this provision shall not exceed two (2) percent of the estimated cost of construction of the improvements. 
    Per diem inspection rates shall equal to one hundred (100) percent of the engineer's quoted charge to the Village based upon the Manual of Professional Practices for Civil Engineers. If inspection is performed by an inspector on the Village payroll the charge shall be one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the regular salary paid to the inspector, computed to an hourly basis. For time spent outside of the regular working hours of the inspector, the hourly charge shall be two hundred (200) percent of the regular salary paid to the inspector computed to an hourly basis. (Ord. No. 7-1975, § 1, 3-25-75) 
8.  Subdivider responsible: Approval by the inspector or absence of inspection shall in no way relieve the subdivider of full responsibility for adherence by his contractors to specifications and working drawings nor for high standards of material, methods and workmanship. 
9.  Approval not acceptance: Approval by the inspector shall not be deemed acceptance of the improvements by the Village. Acceptance shall be only by action of the Board of Trustees and acceptance shall be contingent upon a favorable inspection report. 
10.  Notification: It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider or his contractor to notify the Village Clerk when work on improvements is to be performed. The initial notification that a particular improvement is to be started shall be in writing, and shall reach the Village Clerk seven (7) days in advance of the date of starting work. If the work on a particular improvement is interrupted, the subdivider or his contractor shall notify the Village Clerk or the inspector at least sixteen (16) hours prior to returning to work. 
11.  Guarantee of completion and maintenance: [Repealed by Ord. No. 16-1964.] 
11a.  Guarantee of completion and maintenance: The subdivider shall guarantee the completion of all required improvements within a reasonable period in compliance with working drawings and specifications, and shall guarantee to maintain said improvements until they are accepted by the Village Board. Pursuant to this requirement the subdivider, after approval of the proposed plat by the Plan Commission and the Village Board, shall deposit a cash bond with the Village Clerk in accordance with a specific escrow agreement between the subdivider and the Village as approved by the Board of Trustees, or a surety bond or irrevocable letter of credit approved by the Board of Trustees. The amount of the bond or letter of credit shall not be less than one hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the estimated cost of the improvements. Upon recommendation of the Village Engineer and approval by the Board of Trustees, the amount of the bond or letter of credit may be reduced as the work progresses; provided, however, that the bond or letter of credit shall not be reduced to less than twenty-five (25) percent of the original value until and unless all improvements are complete and acceptable by the Board of Trustees. No work shall be undertaken by any subdivider upon any improvement pursuant to the approval of any plat until the bonds or letters of credit hereinbefore described shall have been approved and filed. 
INTERPRETATIONS OF PROVISIONS OF GUARANTEE OF COMPLETION AND MAINTENANCE 
    It is the intention of this ordinance to encourage building in the Village consistent with the protection of the public's interest without placing undue financial hardship on subdividers for bond or letter of credit expenses. Therefore, the following examples of procedure are given to clarify the intent of the ordinance and to provide suggestions to subdividers for economizing on bond or letter of credit expenses. 
(1)  If a subdivider intends to subdivide a large plot of land, it will be more economical for him if he requests approval for a plat covering only the amount of land that he intends to develop in the near future. In obtaining this plat approval, the subdivider would supply to the Plan Commission the general plan for the entire area to be developed. This procedure will eliminate the necessity for the subdivider furnishing bonds or letters of credit for improvements which are to be installed several years in the future. 
(2)  If a subdivider has obtained a plat approval for a subdivision and has posted a bond or letter of credit to cover the cost of the improvements and, after developing part of the plat, decided to discontinue the development, the Board of Trustees upon recommendation of the Plan Commission, may release the bond or letter of credit for the undeveloped area, providing the improvements already installed constitute properly operating and functional system and provided that the subdivider vacates the undeveloped part of the plat. 
(3)  If a subdivider desires to post a cash bond to cover the cost of improvements, it is possible, in view of the above provision permitting reduction of the bond or letter of credit to no less than twenty-five (25) percent of its original value, that part of the cash bond can be refunded to the subdivider as the improvements are completed, permitting the subdivider to use this money to pay his subcontractors for the installation of the improvements. 
    The above examples are given for illustrative purposes only and in no way limit or change the force or intent of any part of this ordinance. (Ord. No. 8-1993, § 1, 5-25-93; Ord. No. 22-1998, § 1, 9-8-98) 
11b.  As-built drawings: Upon completion of the water mains, sanitary sewers, storm sewers and street lights and before final acceptance of the above mentioned improvements by the Board of Trustees, the subdividers shall deliver to the Village Hall, three (3) copies of "as built" drawings. These drawings shall include, but are not limited to, the "as built" dimensions, distances, quantities, and location (with respect to R. O. W. and easement boundaries) of all water mains, sanitary sewers, storm sewers and street light cables. 
    Also, the "as built" rim and invert elevations of all sanitary and storm manholes and catch basins, and the invert elevation of all storm sewer outfalls shall be provided. The location of all sanitary service wyes shall be shown in relation to the manhole immediately downstream. Also included should be any other pertinent information deemed necessary by the Village of Hazel Crest for the future maintenance of said improvements. (Ord. No. 4-1974, 1-22-74) 
12.  Responsibility for maintenance: As further assurance of serviceable construction and to provide for repair of damage resulting from subsequent construction operations of the subdivider or his contractors, the subdivider shall be responsible for all maintenance of an improvement for a period of not less than fifteen (15) months, following completion of construction of that improvement, providing, in addition, that the subdivider shall be responsible for all maintenance of roadways, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, parkway strips and extension boxes and hydrants of water facilities until all construction work has been completed upon other improvements adjacent to the improvement under consideration. Construction work shall be deemed to include all necessary backfill and grading. A planting strip shall be deemed to include application and finish grading of topsoil and all planting and seeding that may be required. An improvement shall not be accepted by the Village sooner than fifteen (15) months after completion of construction nor until all maintenance work is complete. 
13.  Acceptance: Acceptance of an improvement for the Village shall be only by resolution of the Board of Trustees upon recommendation of the Village President. Recommendation shall be contingent upon: 
(a)  Fulfillment of the requirements of paragraph 12; 
(b)  An opinion by the Village Attorney that satisfactory and proper conveyances have been made by the subdivider to the Village; 
(c)  Improvement being complete and in good repair in accordance with Village standards and requirements; 
(d)  Inspection reports indicating compliance with working drawings and specifications; 
(e)  A single improvement shall not be accepted in part; it shall be complete throughout the subdivision as indicated in the final plat and working drawings. The subgrade base course and surface course of a street, alley or parking area shall be considered as a single improvement; 
(f)  Acceptance of an improvement shall constitute release of the applicable portion of the performance bond or of the applicable portion of the balance of cash deposit. 
(g)  Fulfillment of the requirements of paragraph 11b. (Ord. No. 4-1974, 1-22-74) 
g.  Existing improvements. 
1.  Protection and repair: The subdivider, his contractors and suppliers shall be jointly and severally responsible that existing improvements and the property of the Village are not damaged or rendered less useful or unsightly by the operations of the subdivider, his contractors or suppliers. This provision is intended to include damage or nuisance with respect to the land, improvements or landscaping of the Village; damage to existing streets, sidewalks, curbs and gutters, [or] parkways by passage thereover of equipment or trucks or by excavation for any purpose; the spillage or tracking of earth, sand or rock onto streets, sidewalks, curbs and gutters, or parkways or into catch basins; damage to water mains, sanitary sewers, culverts or storm sewers. To reduce or localize the possibility of damage to streets by heavy trucking, the Village President shall instruct the subdivider as to the streets to be used for access to the subdivision by equipment or trucks, and the subdivider shall be responsible for enforcement of this instruction upon his contractors and their suppliers. The subdivider shall make provisions to prevent washing of earth or sand onto sidewalks, streets, curbs and gutters, and into catch basins by storm water. Where deemed advisable, the Village President shall have the power to require, either prior to commencement of construction or after construction is in process, that the subdivider post a surety to guarantee repair of damages or abatement of nuisance. Where need for surety becomes apparent after construction is in process, the Board of Trustees shall have the power to order construction discontinued until surety has been posted. Expenses incurred by the Village in repairing damages, cleaning streets, catch basins and sewers shall be deducted from the surety. 
2.  Provisions for haul roads: In cases where a subdivision is developed by phases, units, additions or clusters; or when, in the opinion of the Director of Public Works and Buildings, continued development of a subdivision will result in the use of improved, surfaced, or finished streets by construction traffic, the subdivider shall be required to construct and maintain an all-weather haul road to the construction site. It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider to enforce the use of the haul road by his contractors, subcontractors and suppliers. 
    Upon approval of the preliminary layout and prior to the commencement of any construction, the subdivider shall submit his proposed layout(s) and construction specifications for the haul road to the Village for review. Subdividers who have obtained preliminary layout approval and have started construction prior to the date of passage of this ordinance shall submit their haul road layout(s) and construction specifications with the site plans for the next proposed unit, addition, phase, cluster or continuation. 
    The subdivider shall be responsible for and provide the necessary measures for dust control along the haul road and within the construction site, and will take the necessary precautions to avoid depositing dirt on roadways adjacent to the haul road. Access to isolated lots within the subdivision through the use of improved streets may be allowed only after the subdivider has obtained the proper permit from the Village. (Ord. No. 11-1975, § 1, 4-8-75) 
h.  Other Regulations [to] prevail. None of the provisions of these regulations pertaining to permission, surety, fees, acceptance and approval, shall be construed as exempting subdividers, general contractors, sidewalk contractors, cement contractors, building contractors, plumbing contractors or plumbers, sewer contractors, sewer builders, drain layers, electrical contractors, electricians or any other contractor or craftsman from any other ordinance or regulation of the Village with respect to licenses, fees, surety, inspection or other control. 
Section IV. - Procedure. 
a.  Commencement of construction. No grading, building or construction of any kind relating to development of land within the definition of subdivision shall be started except in accordance with these regulations. Construction of improvements shall be in accordance with section III, subdivision f. Construction of buildings and dwellings shall be started only after issuance of building permits and no building permit shall be issued prior to recording of the final plat. 
b.  Informal consideration. While the subdivision plan is still in sketch form, the subdivider may consult with the Plan Commission to determine conformity to the Official Plan and the Zoning Ordinance, and compliance with these regulations and with other Village ordinances not in conflict with these regulations. 
c.  Preliminary layout. Prior to the completion of the final survey of streets and lots of any subdivision and before any map of the subdivision is made in form suitable for recording, a preliminary layout, prepared in accordance with the regulations set forth herein, should be submitted to the Plan Commission for its review and recommendations. (Also see section V.) In the event a proposed subdivision is one (1) acre or less in area, the subdivider shall have the right to dispense with preparation of the final plat. In such case the fee of paragraph i. of this section shall be payable upon submission of the final plat. 
d.  Submission of preliminary layout. An application in writing in quadruplicate for the conditional approval of the subdivision, together with ten (10) prints of the preliminary layout shall be filed with the chairman of the Plan Commission at the Village Hall. The chairman of the Plan Commission will forward copies of the application with prints to the Village Board, the Park Commission and the school boards having jurisdiction in the area involved. 
    The Plan Commission shall determine whether the preliminary layout is in proper form and shall not receive or consider the application as filed until all documents are in accordance with the requirements set forth herein. 
    The application is to be accompanied by a statement from the Village Collector that the filing fee has been paid as specified in paragraph i. 
e.  Consideration of preliminary layout. The Plan Commission will study the preliminary layout in connection with the Official Plan, the Zoning Ordinance, and the topography of the area, and will take into consideration the general requirements of the community, the particular requirements of the neighborhood, and the best use of the land to be subdivided. Particular attention will be given to specific requirements for parks, playgrounds, school sites, major streets, the adequacy of street connections and the suitability of the land for development. 
f.  Action on preliminary layout. The Plan Commission will communicate its conditional approval or its disapproval, in writing, to the subdivider within sixty (60) days of the time at which application for conditional approval is made, giving, in case of conditional approval: 
(1)  The specific changes which it will require in the preliminary layout; 
(2)  The character and extent of the required public improvement. 
g.  Conditional approval of preliminary layout. Conditional approval by the Plan Commission of the preliminary layout does not constitute acceptance of the plat of the proposed subdivision, acceptance of proposed improvements or final agreement as to improvement specifications or costs. It is to be considered only as approval of general layout design. 
h.  Effective period of conditional approval. Conditional approval of the preliminary layout shall be effective for a maximum period of twelve (12) months except that submission within this period of a final plat applying to a portion of the area covered by the preliminary layout shall extend the effective period to twenty-four (24) months from the date of submission of the preliminary layout. If a final plat has not been submitted to the Plan Commission within these time limits, the preliminary layout shall again be submitted to the Plan Commission for conditional approval. 
i.  Fees. 
(1)  Preliminary plat: In order to cover the costs of examining the layout, advertising and holding public hearings, the subdivider shall pay a fee at the time conditional approval is given. Such fee shall be based on the estimated number of lots and shall apply to the costs of final plat approval which is described in subsection 1. Should the petitioner fail to request final plat approval, this fee will be considered as reimbursement for costs incurred by the Village. If, because of the failure of the subdivider to submit a final plat within twelve (12) months after receiving conditional approval of a preliminary plat, it is necessary to resubmit a preliminary plat for conditional approval, the subdivider shall be required to pay the fee currently in effect at the time of resubmission, 
(2)  Amount: The fees for preliminary approval of a subdivider shall be charged and collected at the following rates: 
Number of Lots 
in Subdivision 
1 to 10 ..... $225.00 
11 to 25 ..... 550.00 
Over 25 ..... 1,100.00 
(Ord. No. 8-1972, 3-28-72) 
(3)  Place of payment: Fees shall be paid to the Village Collector at the Village Hall. 
(4)  Use: All fees collected for the approval of subdivisions shall be paid into the general corporate fund of the Village of Hazel Crest. 
(5)  Separate charge: All fees established by this section are in addition to any sums paid to cover costs of field inspection of construction as required under the provisions of section III, subsection f. 
j.  Submission of final plat. After approval of the preliminary layout by the Plan Commission and fulfillment of the required conditions, the subdivider shall apply in writing to the chairman of the Plan Commission for approval of a final plat. The final plat shall conform substantially to the preliminary layout as given conditional approval. The application shall be in duplicate and shall be accompanied by the original inked plat on tracing cloth or vellum, and ten (10) prints. Specifications for the plat and for other documents to accompany the application are given in section V of these regulations. The final plat will not be considered as submitted unless in agreement with specifications and accompanied by required documents. 
k.  Hearing. The chairman of the Plan Commission will notify the subdivider or his representative of the time and place at which he will be heard on behalf of his application. 
l.  Fees: Final plat. To cover the costs of publications, administration and engineering and architectural review, the subdivider shall pay a fee calculated on the basis of one-half of one (1/2 of 1) percent of the certified engineer's construction costs estimate of improvements. There will be no refund of any portion of the fee if the subdivider fails to complete construction of the subdivision. Fees shall be paid to the Village Collector at the Village Hall, prior to final approval of the Village Board. 
m.  Action on final plat. The Plan Commission will communicate in writing to the subdivider its recommendation for approval of the final plat, or its disapproval, together with the reasons therefor within sixty (60) days after the date on which application for such approval is made. If the Plan Commission approves the final plat, such approval will be entered upon the tracings by signature of the chairman. The tracings shall then be transmitted to the Board of Trustees by the Plan Commission with recommendation for Board approval. Approval by the Board shall be by resolution setting forth all conditions upon which approval is predicated. The Village President shall then sign the tracings, but only after all conditions set forth by the Board have been fully met. 
    The original tracing shall be transmitted by the Village President for recording by appropriate officials of the County of Cook and after recording, the tracing shall be returned to the Village and filed by the Clerk. Appropriate notifications shall be given the Plan Commission and the subdivider advising Board approval or disapproval and advising document numbers after recording. If the plat is disapproved, the tracings are to be returned to the Plan Commission with statement of reasons. 
n.  Approval not acceptance of improvements. Village Board approval of the final plat shall not be deemed to constitute or effect acceptance of any improvements. 
o.  Effectiveness of final approval. Approval of the final plat by the Plan Commission and the Village Board shall be null and void if the plat is not acceptable for recording in the office of the Recorder of Deeds of the County of Cook. 
p.  Documents. Attendant documents accompanying the final plat are to be forwarded to the Board of Trustees with the tracings and are to be filed by the Village Clerk. 
Section V. - Documents.

APPENDIX B - AUTOMATED TRAFFIC LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- This appendix contains the implementation of an automated traffic enforcement system in the village, enacted April 22, 2008. Amendments to the ordinance have been worked into their proper places and amended provisions have been deleted. Amendatory ordinances are cited in parentheses following the provision amended. The absence of such a citation indicates that the provision has not been amended. This appendix is set out in its original format, using the original section numbering system and catchlines. Any explanatory words or phrases are indicated in brackets [ ]. 

14.260 - Definitions. 
    Automated traffic law enforcement system means a device within the village with one or more motor vehicle sensors working in conjunction with a red light signal to produce recorded images of motor vehicles entering an intersection against a steady or flashing red signal indication in violation of Section 11-306 of the Illinois Vehicle Code ("Code"), 625 ILCS 5/11-306, or similar violation of the Village of Hazel Crest Municipal Code. 
    Disregarding a traffic control device means failure to stop and remain stopped before an intersection that is controlled by a red signal as provided for in section 11-306 of the Code. 
    No turn on red means where the motor vehicle comes to a complete stop and does not enter the intersection as defined by section 1-132 of the Code, during the cycle of the red signal indication unless one or more pedestrians are present, even if the motor vehicle stops at a point past a stop line or crosswalk where a driver is required to stop, as specified in subsection (c) of section 11-306 of the Code or this appendix. 
    Recorded images means images produced by the automated traffic law enforcement system, which consist of either two (2) or more photographs; two (2) or more microphotographs; two (2) or more electronic images; or, a video recording showing the motor vehicle and, on at least one image or portion of the recording, clearly identifying the registration plate number of the motor vehicle. 
    Traffic compliance administrator means the person appointed as such through article 25 of the Code and shall have the following additional powers: adopt, distribute and process automated traffic law violation notices and other notices required by this article, collect money paid as fines and penalties, operate the automated traffic law enforcement system, and make certified reports to the Secretary of State as required by this article. 
(Ord. No. 16-2010, 11-9-10) 
14.261 - Violations. 
    It shall be a violation of this article for a vehicle to disregard a traffic control device or turn on red in violation of section 11-306 of the Code. All violations must be reviewed and approved by a law enforcement officer of the village. 
(Ord. No. 16-2010, 11-9-10) 
14.262 - Defenses. 
    The following may be considered defenses by the hearing officer for a violation of section 14.261: 
1.  That the motor vehicle or registration plates of the motor vehicle were stolen before the violation occurred, and not under the control of or in the possession of the owner at the time of the violation; 
2.  That the driver of the vehicle passed through the intersection when the light was red either (i) in order to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle or (ii) as part of a funeral procession. 
    To demonstrate that the motor vehicle or the registration plates were stolen before the violation occurred and were not under the control or possession of the owner at the time of the violation, the owner must submit proof that a report concerning the stolen motor vehicle or registration plates was filed with a law enforcement agency in a timely manner. 
(Ord. No. 16-2010, 11-9-10) 
14.263 - Notice of violation. 
    When the automated traffic law enforcement system records a motor vehicle entering an intersection in violation of section 14.261, the village shall issue a written notice of violation to the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle, which shall be delivered by U.S. Mail within thirty (30) days after the Illinois Secretary of State notifies the village of the identity of the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle, and in no event later than ninety (90) days following the violation. The village shall only be required to notify a lessee if the leasing company/lessor provides the lessee's name by an affidavit and a copy of the lease within sixty (60) days of the notice's issuance. If the driver information is not provided within sixty (60) days, the leasing company/lessor may be found liable. If any notice to an address is returned as undeliverable, a second notice shall be sent to the last known address recorded in a United States Post Office approved database of the owner or lessee of the cited vehicle. The second notice shall be made by first class mail postage prepaid. 
    A notice of violation associated with an automated traffic law violation shall require a review of the associated recorded image by the traffic compliance administrator, who shall inspect the image and determine whether the motor vehicle was being operated in violation of section 14.261, or whether one of the defenses enumerated in section 14.262 is visibly applicable upon inspection. Upon determination that the recorded image captures a violation and that no defense applies, the notice of violation shall be served upon the registered vehicle owner in the manner provided for above. The traffic compliance administrator shall retain a copy of all violation notices, recorded images and other correspondence mailed to the owner of the vehicle. Each notice of violation shall constitute evidence of the facts contained in the notice and is admissible in any proceeding alleging a violation of the above-noted statutory and local provisions and shall be prima facie evidence of a violation, subject to rebuttal on the basis of the defenses established in this article. 
    The notice of violation shall include the following information: 
1.  The name and address of the registered owner or lessee of the vehicle, as indicated by the records of the Secretary of State, or, if such information is outdated or unattainable, then the last known address recorded in a United States Post Office approved database; 
2.  The make (only if discernable) and registration number of the motor vehicle involved in the violation; 
3.  The violation charged; 
4.  The location where the violation occurred; 
5.  The date and time of the violation; 
6.  A copy of the recorded images; 
7.  The amount of the civil penalty and the date by which the penalty should be paid (fourteen (14) days from the date of issuance), if a hearing is not requested, and a statement that the payment of the fine shall operate as a final disposition of the violation; 
8.  A statement that a failure to pay the civil penalty by the date noted may result in an additional late fee being assessed against the owner or lessee; 
9.  The amount of the late fee; 
10.  A statement that the failure to pay by the date specified will result in a final determination of liability and may result in the suspension of driving privileges for the registered owner of the vehicle; 
11.  A statement that the recorded images constitute prima facie evidence of a violation; 
12.  A statement that the person may elect to proceed by paying the fine or challenging the charge in court, by mail or by administrative hearing; and 
13.  A statement of how an administrative hearing may be requested. 
(Ord. No. 16-2010, 11-9-10) 
14.264 - Hearing. 
    The owner of a vehicle being operated in violation of section 14.261 may request a hearing by the respond-by date on the notice of violation (fourteen (14) days from the date of issuance), to challenge the evidence or set forth an applicable defense. The notice of violation shall constitute evidence of the facts contained in the notice and is admissible in any proceeding alleging a violation of section 14.261. The notice of violation shall be prima facie evidence of a violation, subject to rebuttal on the basis of the defenses established in section 14.262. 
    The owner's failure to appear at the hearing will result in a finding of liability. In the event of a failure to appear, a "Findings, Decision and Order" letter will be sent to the owner. The owner's failure to pay the amount by the date specified in that letter will result in a final determination. 
(Ord. No. 16-2010, 11-9-10) 
14.265 - Non-residents. 
    Where the registered owner or lessee of the cited vehicle is not a resident of the village but seeks to contest the merits of the alleged violation, such person may contest the charges using the same available defenses as stated above, but rather than attend the administrative hearing, they may submit any and all documentary evidence to the traffic compliance administrator no later than the hearing date, together with a written statement reflecting that they are non-residents of the village. The traffic compliance administrator shall forward all timely-submitted materials to the hearing officer for review and determination. 
(Ord. No. 16-2010, 11-9-10) 
14.266 - Final determination. 
    A final determination of an automated traffic law violation(s) liability shall occur: 
A.

If a person appears at a hearing and is found liable or contests the violation by mail and is found liable, the hearing officer will enter findings, decision and order, which is a final determination of automated traffic law violation liability that is a final, appealable order. 
(Ord. No. 16-2010, 11-9-10)

2.  The person having already paid the fine for the violation in question; and 
3.  Excusable failure to appear at or request a new date for a hearing. 
    Upon receipt of a timely petition to set aside the determination of liability, the hearing officer shall review the petition to determine if cause has been shown to set aside the determination. If cause has been shown, the village shall forward the petitioner a new hearing date on which the petitioner must appear to present his case. The village shall notify the petitioner of the hearing officer's decision to grant a hearing or deny the petition within fourteen (14) days of the village's receipt. 
(Ord. No. 16-2010, 11-9-10)

The name, last known address as recorded with the Secretary of State, as provided by the lessor of the cited vehicle at the time of lease, or as recorded in a United States post office approved database if any notice sent under this article is returned as undeliverable, and driver's license number of the person who failed to pay the fine or penalty and the registration number of any vehicle known to be registered to such person in a state;

A certified copy of such notification shall also be given upon request and at no additional charge to the person named therein. 
    Any person receiving notice from the Secretary of State that their driving privileges may be suspended at the end of a specified period may challenge the accuracy of the certified report prepared by the traffic compliance administrator. The person shall, within seven (7) days after having received notice from the Secretary of State, request an opportunity to speak with the traffic compliance administrator to challenge the accuracy of the certified report. If the traffic compliance administrator determines that the original report was in error due to the fact that the person challenging the report was not the owner or lessee of the vehicle or that the person has already paid their fine for the five (5) or more automated traffic violations, the traffic compliance administrator shall immediately notify the Secretary of State of such error in a subsequent certified report. 
(Ord. No. 16-2010, 11-9-10)

In the event that such penalty is not paid within fourteen (14) days after service of a final determination of liability, an additional one hundred dollar ($100.00) late payment penalty shall be imposed. A penalty shall not apply if the driver of the motor vehicle received a uniform traffic citation from a police officer at the time of the violation. The village may not charge court costs or hearing fees to persons found liable after exercising their right to appear and contest the violation at an administrative hearing.

Any amendments to the final plat shall be recorded or registered. 
13.6 - Failure to develop or implement amendment. 
    In the event no building permit has been issued within one (1) year of the date of the filing of the final plat, and construction is not substantially completed within one (1) year thereafter, the development may be considered null and void and the village may, at its option, initiate such zoning amendments as it deems necessary for the public interest. 
13.7 - Variations. 
A.  Authority. The planning and zoning commission shall not approve where it has final decision making power, nor shall it recommend where it does not, any variation unless the planning and zoning commission has made findings of fact specified the reason or reasons for recommending or approving the variation. Such findings shall be based upon the standards hereinafter prescribed. Also, where the village board decides whether to grant a variation hereunder, no variation shall be granted by the village board without such findings of fact. 
B.  Initiation. An application for a variation may be made by any person, firm, or corporation, or by an office, department, board, bureau or commission requesting or intending to request application for a building permit, zoning certificate or occupancy certificate. 
C.  Application for variation and notice of hearing.

Notice of such hearing shall be published at least once, not more than thirty (30) days nor less than fifteen (15) days before the hearing, in a newspaper published within the village and if there is none then in a newspaper of general circulation within the village. The published notice may be supplemented by such additional form of notice as the planning and zoning commission may require. 
D.  Standards for variations. Accordingly the planning and zoning commission shall hear and make a final determination on a variation, except for sign variances which requires the approval of the board of trustees. The planning and zoning commission shall issue findings of fact based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case which requires that all three (3) of the following be met: 
1.  The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the regulations in the district in which it is located. 
2.  The plight of the owner is due to unique circumstances. 
3.  The variation if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality. 
4.  For the purpose of implementing the above rule, the planning and zoning commission shall also, in making its determination whether there are practical difficulties or particular hardships, take into consideration the extent to which the following facts favorable to the applicant have been established by the evidence: 
a)  The particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical condition of the specific property involved would result in a particular hardship upon the owner, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations were carried out. 
b)  Conditions upon which the petition for variation is based would not be applicable, generally, to other property within the same zoning classification. 
c)  The purpose of the variation is not based exclusively upon a desire to make more money out of the property. 
d)  The alleged difficulty or hardship has not been created by the owner of the property, or the previous owner. 
e)  The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located. 
f)  The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property, or substantially increase the congestion in the public streets, or increase the danger of fire, or endanger the public safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood. 
5.  The planning and zoning commission may recommend, and the village board of trustees may require, such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a variation as may be necessary to comply with the standards set forth in the section to reduce or minimize the injurious effect of such variation upon other property in the neighborhood and better to carry out the general intent of this zoning appendix. 
E.  Authorized variations. Authorized variations from the regulations of this zoning appendix shall be approved (where it has final decision making power) or recommended (when it does not) by the planning and zoning commission, or the board of trustees, if applicable, only in accordance with the standards set out in this section, and may be granted only in the following instances, and in no others: 
1.  To permit without the necessity of a public hearing up to a twenty-five (25) per cent reduction in the front, side or rear yard required by this appendix. A greater variation may be recommended but only after a public hearing as required by law. 
2.  To permit the use of a lot or lots for use otherwise prohibited solely because of insufficient area or width of the lot or lots. 
3.  To increase the gross area of any sign. 
4.  To extend the period of time a nonconforming use may continue or remain. 
5.  Permit the construction of a nonconforming building which has been damaged by explosion, fire, act of God, or public enemy, to the extent of more that fifty (50) per cent of its assessed value, where the commission finds some compelling necessity requiring a continuance of the nonconforming use, and the primary purpose of continuing the nonconforming use is not to continue a monopoly. 
F.  Required vote. The concurring vote of four (4) members of the village board or shall be necessary to reverse the recommendation of the planning and zoning commission on any requested variation. 
13.8 - Special uses. 
A.  Purpose. The development and execution of the zoning appendix is based upon the division of the village into districts, within which districts the use of land and buildings and the bulk and location of buildings and structures in relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there are special uses which, because of their unique characteristics, cannot be properly classified in any particular district or districts without consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need for the particular use at the particular location. Such special uses fall into two (2) categories: 
1.  Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public interest. 
2.  Uses entirely private in character but of such nature that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring property or public facilities. 
B.  Authority. Special use permits may authorized or denied by the village board of trustees, but only after a public hearing has been held, in the manner prescribed herein for amendments to this appendix, and a written report outlining the findings and recommendations of the planning and zoning commission have been prepared and submitted to the village board. All special use request shall be heard by the planning and zoning commission including requests for planned developments. 
C.  Initiation. An application for special use may be made by any person, firm, or corporation having an ownership interest, an option to purchase, or any exclusive possessory interest which is specifically enforceable on the land which is described in the application for a special use. 
D.  Application for a special use. An application for a special use or for a change to or expansion of a special use shall be filed with the zoning administrator on the form provided and shall be accompanied by such plans and data as specified by the planning and zoning commission. 
E.  Standards. No special use shall be recommended by the planning and zoning commission, unless said commission shall find: 
1.  That the establishment, maintenance, or operation of the special use will not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety, morals, comfort or general welfare. 
2.  That the special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted, nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the neighborhood. 
3.  That the establishment of the special use will not impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of surrounding property for uses permitted in the district. 
4.  That adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or other necessary utilities have been or are being provided. 
5.  That adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and egress so designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets. 
6.  That the special use shall in all other respects conform to the applicable regulations of the district in which it is located, except as such regulations may in each instance be modified by the village board pursuant to the recommendations of the planning and zoning commission. 
7.  Each adult use shall be a minimum of one thousand (1,000) feet from the property line of another adult use. 
8.  Each adult use shall be a minimum of one thousand (1,000) feet from any previously existing church, school, library, park or other publicly operated recreational facility. 
9.  All distances specified shall be measured by following a straight line, without regard to intervening structures, from the nearest point on the property line or zoning district boundary line from which the proposed use is to be separated to the nearest point of the property on which the proposed use is to be located. 
10.  No alcoholic beverages shall be sold, served or consumed within the premises of an adult use. 
The village board shall impose such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a special use permit as may be necessary to assure compliance with the above standards, to reduce or minimize the effect of such permit upon other properties in the neighborhood, and to better carry out the general intent of this appendix. Failure to comply with such conditions or restrictions shall constitute a violation of this appendix. 
F.  Expiration. Within eighteen (18) months from the date the special use permit was first issued, the petitioner shall submit a final plan to the board of trustees which shall conform to the preliminary plan as finally approved herein and the special permit issued herein. When a special use has been issued for the purpose of use only, construction must be substantially complete within eighteen (18) months. The board of trustees may extend any time limit provided or required herein or in any special permit issued herein; provided, that such extensions may not exceed a total of thirty-six (36) months.

13.13 - Disclosure of beneficiaries of a trust. 
    The liabilities hereunder imposed on an owner shall attach to a trustee under a land trust, holding title to such building, structure, or premises without the right of possession, management, or control, unless said trustee in a proceeding under said provisions of this appendix discloses in a verified pleading or in an affidavit filed with the court, the name and last known address for each person who was a beneficiary of the trust at the time of the alleged violation and of each person, if any, who was then acting as agent for the purpose of managing, controlling, or collecting rents, as the same may appear on the records of the trust.
