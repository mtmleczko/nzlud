PREFACE\ 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Wheaton, Illinois. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1996 Code, as supplemented through January 4, 2016, and ordinances adopted by the City Council on or before August 1, 2016. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1996 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 RELATED LAWS RL:1 SPECIAL ACTS SA:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 RELATED LAWS COMPARATIVE TABLE RLCT:1 SPECIAL ACTS COMPARATIVE TABLE SACT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Julie Lovelace, Code Attorney, and Kellyn Wilcox, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Sharon Barrett-Hagen, City Clerk; and James Knippen, City Attorney for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the City readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the City's affairs.

(1)  Where the violation is a single-day offense, impose a fine of not less than $100.00, nor more than $950.00; or 
(2)  Continue the case for a period not to exceed 30 days and require that the defendant comply with the relevant provision of this Code or abate the condition which is the basis for the conviction, within a period specified by the court, not to exceed 30 days.

(2)  Where a violation continues to exist as of the date of conviction, shall retain jurisdiction for imposition of a continued daily fine of not less than $100.00 nor more than $950.00 per day for each day of the violation until there is compliance with this Code or abatement of the condition which is the basis for the conviction; or 
(3)  May use its powers of contempt as the court deems appropriate.

(a)  By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the city council. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive parts of permanent and general ordinances passed by the city council during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages that have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b)  In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified Code.

(c)  No member or employee of the council or any other person in attendance at the meeting shall be required to participate in any prayer that is offered. 
(d)  An invocation shall be voluntarily delivered by an eligible member of the clergy as specified below. To ensure that such person ("invocation speaker") is selected from a wide pool of local clergy on a rotating basis, the invocation speaker shall be selected according to the following procedure: 
(1)  The city clerk ("clerk") shall compile and maintain a database (the "congregations list") of the religious congregations with an established presence in the local community of the city. 
(2)  The congregations list shall be compiled by referencing the listing for "churches, congregations, synagogues, mosques or temples," or other religious assemblies in the annual Yellow and White Pages phone books published for the city, researched from the Internet, and in consultation with local chambers of commerce. All religious congregations with an established presence in the local community of the city are eligible to be, and shall be, included in the congregations list. Any such congregation not otherwise identified for participation may request its inclusion by written communications to the clerk. 
(3)  This policy is intended to be and shall be applied in a way that is all-inclusive of every diverse religious congregation in the city. The congregations list is compiled and used for purposes of logistics, efficiency and equal opportunity for all of the community's religious groups, who may, themselves, choose whether to respond to the council's invitation and participate. Should a question as to the authenticity of a religious congregation, the clerk shall refer to the criteria used by the Internal Revenue Service in its determination of those religious organizations that would legitimately qualify for Section 501(c)(3) tax exempt status or which are registered with the Illinois Secretary of State as religious corporations. 
(4)  The congregations list shall also include the name and contact information of any chaplain who may serve one or more of the fire departments or law enforcement agencies of the city. 
(5)  The congregations list shall also include the name and contact information of any religious congregation located outside the city, if such religious congregation is regularly attended by a resident or residents of the city and such residents request the inclusion of said religious congregation by written communication to the clerk. 
(6)  The congregations list shall be updated by reasonable efforts of the clerk on or about the month of December of each calendar year. 
(7)  Within 30 days of the effective date of this policy, and on or about December 1 of each calendar year thereafter, the city clerk shall mail an invitation addressed to the "religious leader" of each congregation listed on the congregations list, as well as to the individual chaplain included on the congregations list. 
(8)  The invitation shall be dated at the top of the page signed by the clerk at the bottom of the page, and shall read as follows: 
    "Dear Religious Leader, 
    The Wheaton City Council makes it a policy to invite members of the Clergy in Wheaton and other identified by residents of Wheaton who are regular attendees at a religious congregation outside the City of Wheaton, to voluntarily offer an invocation before the beginning of its meetings, for the benefit and blessings of the Council. As the leader of one of the religious congregations with an established presence in the local community, or in your capacity as a chaplain for one of the local fire departments or law enforcement agencies, or as a religious leader of one or more Wheaton residents' religious congregations, you are eligible to offer this important service in an upcoming meeting of Council. 
    If you are willing to assist the Council in this regard, please send a written reply at your earliest convenience to the Council's secretary at the address included on this letterhead. Clergy are scheduled on a first come first served basis. The dates of the Council's scheduled meetings for the up-coming year are listed on the attached page. If you have a preference on the dates, please state the request on your written reply. 
    This opportunity is voluntary, and you are free to offer the invocation according to the dictates of your own conscience. To maintain a spirit of respect and ecumenism, the Council requests only that the prayer opportunity not be exploited as an effort to convert others to a particular faith of the invocation speaker, nor to disparage any faith or belief different than that of the invocation speaker. 
    On behalf of the City Wheaton Council, I thank you in advance for considering this invitation. 
    Sincerely, 
    City Clerk" 
(9)  The respondents to the invitation shall be scheduled on a first come, first served basis, unless requesting a specific date. There shall be only one invocation speaker per meeting. 
(10)  No invocation speaker shall receive compensation for his service. 
(11)  The clerk shall make every reasonable effort to ensure that a variety of eligible invocation speakers are scheduled for council meetings. In any event, no invocation speaker shall be scheduled to offer a prayer at consecutive meetings of the council, or at more than three council meetings in any calendar year. 
(12)  Neither the council nor the clerk shall engage in any prior inquiry, review of, or involvement in, the content of any prayer to be offered by an invocation speaker. 
(13)  Invocations shall be provided before the opening gavel that officially begins the meeting and the agenda/business of the public. The mayor shall introduce the invocation speaker and the person selected to lead the Pledge of Allegiance following the invocation, and invite only those who wish to do so to stand for observance of the invocation and for the council. No person shall be required to stand for an invocation. 
(14)  This policy is not intended, and shall not be implemented or construed in any way, to affiliate the council with, nor express the council's preference for or against, any faith, religious domination or sect. Rather, this policy is intended to acknowledge and express the council's respect for the diversity of the religious denominations and faiths represented amongst the citizens of the city. 
(15)  A disclaimer shall be included in at least ten-point font at the bottom of any printed council meeting agenda which states, "Any invocation that may be offered before the official start of the council meeting shall be the voluntary offering of a private citizen, to and for the benefit of the council. The views or beliefs expressed by the invocation speaker have not previously been reviewed or approved by the council, or any employee of the city, and the council is not allowed by law, and does not endorse the religious beliefs of the invocation speaker or any other speaker."

a.  If a substantial change to the annexation agreement is desired, a public hearing shall be held by the city council in the same manner as the processing of a new annexation agreement as described in section 18-3. A substantial amendment includes: 
1.  Zoning of any portion of the property; 
2.  Intensity of use including number of dwelling units per acre; 
3.  Reduction of improvements to be installed on the site; 
4.  Reduction of open space or green areas; 
5.  Removal of any building or fixture closer to the boundary lines of the property than originally agreed to; 
6.  Ordinance amendments; 
7.  Length of the agreement; or 
8.  Means of security as to cost and/or installation of public improvements. 
b.  Any other amendment shall be a minor amendment. 
(2)  Minor amendment. If a nonsubstantial change to the annexation agreement is desired, the city council may act to amend without a public hearing. To effect such an amendment, however, the proposed amendment must be placed on the city council agenda at the petitioner's request, so that notice of the proposed amendment will be made public with the rest of the agenda items. Upon considering the proposed amendments, the council may: 
a.  Approve the amendment as requested or as then modified by concurrence of the parties, by ordinance; 
b.  Refer to the administration for further study and report; or 
c.  Determine that the proposed amendment represents a substantial change and direct the petitioner to call for a public hearing. 
All amendments shall be by ordinance passed by two-thirds of the council then holding office.

    Fire alarm protection system means a system, including devices and equipment to detect fire, activate an alarm or suppress or control a fire, or any combination thereof. 
    Fire suppression system means a mechanical system designed and equipped to detect fire, activate an alarm, or suppress a fire. 
(b)  Installation and operation maintenance standards. The installation, operation, maintenance and inspection of any fire alarm protection or suppression system shall be in accordance with the terms of article 15, "Uniform Standards for the Installation, Maintenance and Transmission for Private Alarm Systems Connected to the City of Wheaton's Wireless Alarm Network," sections 22-209 through 22-220 of this chapter.

At the informal hearing, the fire alarm user may offer evidence that the alarm activation for which he is charged was not a false alarm as defined herein. No fine shall be imposed where the evidence establishes that the activation was not a false alarm. 
(f)  Such hearing must be requested in writing, by certified or registered mail, directed to the fire chief, no later than seven days after the mailing of the statement of charges for the false alarm. Failure to timely request a hearing shall constitute an admission that the fine is justified and payable to the city and shall further constitute an irrevocable waiver of such hearing.

Where the director of building and code enforcement, the city manager or other city official designated to be in charge of enforcing the city's building code determines that a residential, commercial or industrial structure has been so damaged by a catastrophic event as to constitute an immediate danger or threat to persons or adjacent properties, and further determines that it would be impractical to enclose the structure itself to eliminate the immediate danger or threat, the city official shall placard the structure with either a notice of perimeter enclosure or demolition and undertake reasonable steps to promptly notify the owner of the necessity of the erection of a perimeter enclosure or demolition. A perimeter enclosure shall mean the erection of a cyclone or similar fence on the lot on which the damaged structure is located which is of sufficient strength, permanency and location to stop the entry of unauthorized persons to the lot and/or the structure pending further action. If the owner cannot be found, or refuses to erect the perimeter enclosure so as to eliminate the immediate danger or threat to persons or adjacent properties or cannot be found within a reasonable period of time due to the nature of the danger or threat, the city official shall have the right and power, but not the obligation, to eliminate the immediate danger or threat by erecting a perimeter enclosure as described by this section or if such perimeter enclosure is not adequate to respond to the eminent danger or threat to persons or adjacent properties, the city official may demolish the structure. If any person seeks a judicial hearing and has served a copy of the complaint on this city before the city proceeds with authorized actions set forth in this section, then the city shall not proceed with the secure perimeter enclosure or demolition until a court issues an order that authorizes the city to do so. 
(b)  Lien. Following the erection of perimeter enclosure or demolition, the city may file a notice of lien against the real estate for the cost of the erection of the perimeter enclosure or demolition within 180 days after the erection of the perimeter enclosure or demolition of the structure for any and all costs and expenses incurred by the city, including attorneys' and consultants' fees in the office of the county recorder of deeds. The notice of lien shall consist of a sworn statement setting forth: 
(1)  A description of the real estate such as the address or other description of the property, sufficient for its identification; 
(2)  The expenses incurred by the city in undertaking the remedial actions authorized under this section; 
(3)  The dates the expenses were incurred by the city; 
(4)  A statement by the city official responsible for enforcing the building code that the structure constituted an eminent danger or threat to persons or adjacent properties; 
(5)  A statement by the city official that the required sign was posted on this structure and a description of service of the notice or the attempts to serve notice upon the owners.

Sec. 22-205. - Procedures for permit approval. 
(a)  Application review. The building and code enforcement department will be responsible for the processing and review of any building demolition permit application. As part of the review process, an inspection of the property may be performed by the building and code enforcement department. 
(b)  Notification. Within five working days of receipt of a complete building demolition permit application for a principal structure, the building and code enforcement department shall, by regular mail, notify the owners of the real estate immediately adjacent to or which, in the absence of a street or alley, would have a contiguous or partially contiguous property line with the subject property that a demolition permit application has been submitted for the property. A sign noticing the proposed demolition shall be placed on the subject property by the city. 
(c)  Permit issuance. The building and code enforcement department shall not issue a permit for a principal structure less than 30 days from the receipt of the structure demolition permit application. 
(d)  Other application processing. The demolition of a principal and/or accessory structure may also be processed as part of an annexation, subdivision, zoning, or special use permit application. Any such application which includes the proposed demolition of a structure must include the permit application information referenced in section 22-202. 
(e)  Meeting with neighbors. 
(1)  Applicability. A meeting with abutting neighbors shall be undertaken by any property owner seeking a permit pursuant to this article authorizing demolition of an existing house (the "applicant")." For purposes of this section an "abutting" property shall be any property having any common boundary with the property owner's property and property which would have a common boundary if not interrupted by a street, alley or other right-of-way. 
(2)  Required meeting. At least 30 days prior to submitting an application for demolition or building permit, a meeting must be conducted by the applicant with the owner or adult resident of each property that immediately is adjacent to and across the street from the subject property (the "abutting owner"). 
(3)  The meeting must be made at a time and place when it is reasonable that the abutting owners will be present. Notice of the meeting date shall be given by letter delivered via the U.S. Postal System to the abutting owners not less than seven days prior to the meeting date. 
(4)  Scope of meeting. During the meeting, the applicant shall show the abutting owners a copy of the proposed site plan, building elevation plan for the project and traffic control plan. The applicant shall explain to the abutting owners, in general terms, the scope of work, the timetable for the work, any special measures such as those being made to protect property, and other matters that may be relevant to the abutting owners. The applicant shall also provide the abutting owners with a city-prepared packet of information including, among any other things, a summary of construction regulations and procedures. 
(5)  The purpose of the meeting is not to secure any form of approval from the abutting owners, but instead to ensure that the abutting owners have had an opportunity to learn, in general terms, about the proposed project. 
(6)  Record of meeting. The applicant must file with the city, prior to the issuance of any permit for work on the subject property, a standard "meeting completion form" that states that the applicant successfully completed the required abutting owners' meeting. 
(7)  Condition precedent to building permit. The filing of the meeting completion form is a condition precedent to issuance by the city of a permit for work on the subject property. 
(8)  Demolition notice requirements still applicable. The meeting visit provisions of this section shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, the demolition notice provisions of this article.

The applicant shall post with the city, at time of issuance of permit for the demolition of a principal structure, a cash demolition bond or a letter of credit in the form as which is on file in the building and code enforcement department in the amount of three percent of the cost of demolition or $10,000.00, whichever is greater. Such bond shall be in addition to all other application and processing fees, costs, escrows, bonds, and performance securities required by codes or ordinances of the city. 
(1)  The city shall have the right at all times, at its option, to draw on the cash demolition bond for the costs, including legal fees and administrative expenses, incurred or to be incurred by the city in exercising any of its rights under this article in the event the applicant undertakes any work in violation of any provisions of this article or of any permit issued or plan approved pursuant to this article, or the applicant fails or refuses to complete any work authorized by any permit issued under this article in accordance with all plans approved in connection with said permit. 
(2)  Replenishment of bond. If the city draws on the bond, then the applicant shall replenish the bond to the full amount required by this subsection (h) immediately after demand therefor is made to the applicant in writing by the city. Any failure of the applicant to replenish the bond shall result in cancellation of the related permit, which permit shall not be reissued thereafter except after the filing of a new application therefor, payment of the permit fee, and establishment of a new bond. 
(3)  Return of unused bond. Upon the completion of demolition, the permit holder shall submit written request for refund of demolition bond or release of demolition letter of credit. The city shall return any unused portion of the demolition bond to the applicant, without interest, within 30 days after final demolition inspection of the subject property and approval of the completed demolition by the director of the building and code enforcement department of the city. Properties where construction of a new principal structure has not commenced within 30 days of demolition, shall be restored as required by subsection (g) of this section before the demolition bond can be returned.

(2)  Single-family residential developments in excess of two and one-half acres in area. 
    The above shall be considered for all such developments within the planning jurisdiction of the city. 
(Ord. No. F-2034, § 1, 9-18-2017) 
Sec. 34-98. - Site runoff storage and release rate. 
(a)  The site runoff storage volume and release rate shall be determined as follows: 
(1)  Less than 1,800 square feet of development. 
No site runoff storage required. 
(2)  Greater than 1,800 and less than 25,000 square feet of non-single-family residential development. 
Runoff storage volume shall be calculated by the following formula: 
(Impervious area in acres) x (10,200) = (Required storage in cubic feet) 
Restrictor size shall be one-inch x one-inch square orifice, or equivalent size. 
(3)  Greater than 25,000 and less than 43,560 square feet of non-single-family residential development. 
Runoff storage volume shall be calculated by the following formula: 
(Impervious area in acres) x (10,200) = (Required storage in cubic feet) 
Restrictor size shall be one-inch x two-inch vertical orifice, or equivalent size. 
(4)  Non-single-family residential development greater than one acre and all single-family residential development greater than two and one-half acres. 
Site runoff storage volume shall be calculated as the volume required to store a 24-hour duration ISWS Bulletin 71 rainfall depth, 100-year rainfall event using a Huff Rainfall Distribution and assuming a control structure that limits the peak runoff from the development site to 0.15 cubic feet per second (cfs) per acre restrictor for the development area. 
Restrictor size shall be calculated as (0.15 cfs) x (Acres of development) 
(b)  The following types of development are not required to provide site runoff storage as required in section 34-98(a).

(Ord. No. F-2034, § 1, 9-18-2017) 
Sec. 34-99. - Bypass channel. 
(a)  A natural or surface channel system shall be designed with adequate capacity to convey through the development the stormwater runoff from all tributary areas whether on-site or off-site. This bypass channel shall be designed to carry the peak rate of runoff from a 100-year storm from all tributary lands, assuming all storm sewers are blocked. No habitable structures shall be constructed within this channel; however, streets and parking or playground areas and utility easements shall be considered compatible uses. Any habitable structure on any parcel adjacent to this channel shall have the lowest opening of its foundation at least two feet above the water surface (hydraulic gradient) of the design flow. 
(b)  Should the development contain an existing natural waterway, this land configuration shall be preserved as part of the bypass channel system with the construction of a low flow system of storm sewers to carry the minor storm runoff and reshaping of the channel with a maximum of six horizontal to one vertical side slopes, and bottom of a width adequate to facilitate maintenance and carry the stormwater runoff. Design of this bypass channel system shall also consider control of stormwater velocity to prevent erosion or other damage to the facility which will restrict its primary use. Depths of flow shall be kept to a minimum. Minimum grades for turf drainageways shall be two percent or they shall be provided with an underdrain system to prevent the ponding of stagnant water or the saturation of lawns. 
(Ord. No. F-2034, § 1, 9-18-2017) 
Sec. 34-100. - Site runoff storage facilities. 
    Outlet control structures shall be designed in accordance with the city storm sewer restrictor detail. Outlet control structures shall be maintenance free and shall be designed for a free discharge that will not cause surcharge of a storm sewer system immediately downstream of the discharge point. Each stormwater storage area shall be provided with a method of emergency overflow in the event that a storm in excess of the 100-year frequency storm occurs. This emergency overflow facility shall be designed to function without attention and shall become part of the natural or surface channel system described in section 34-99. 
    The maximum depth of site runoff storage facilities shall not exceed four feet unless the existing natural ground contours and other conditions lend to a greater storage depth being approved by the director of engineering. 
    The minimum grades for turf areas shall be two percent. Side slopes shall be kept as close to the natural land contours as practical and a 25-percent slope or less shall be used wherever possible. If slopes greater than 25 percent are necessary to meet storage requirements or area restrictions, approval shall be obtained from the director of engineering. 
    Paved surfaces that serve as site runoff storage facilities shall have minimum grades of one percent, unless permeable pavement is used and shall be restricted to storage depths of one foot maximum. 
    Maximum grades for paved surfaces shall not exceed five percent. 
    Available site runoff storage volume shall be computed as the void or free and unobstructed space between the paved surface final grade and a horizontal plane at the elevation of the surface water runoff overflow plus the volume of any underground storage controlled by the restricting orifice. The available site runoff storage volume shall equal or exceed the required retention volume. The required retention for the parking lot may be combined with other retention facilities required for the development.

Sec. 34-166. - Suspension of MS4 access due to detection of illicit discharges. 
    Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this article may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The department shall notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the city for a reconsideration and hearing. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the city. 
    In emergency situations, the department may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4, storm drainage system, or Waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the department may take such steps, including termination of discharge access, as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4, storm drainage system, or Waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to public health and safety. The city may obtain a temporary restraining order or injunction authorizing such termination.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Secs. 36-1-36-18. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - SMOKE- AND VAPE-FREE AIR REGULATIONS[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. F-1207, § 2, adopted Oct. 2, 2006, amended the Code with the addition of a new chapter 43, sections 43-1-43-14. In order to maintain the alphabetical sequence of chapter titles, the provisions of said ordinance have been included herein as a new chapter 52, sections 52-1-52-13, at the discretion of the editor. 

Sec. 36-19. - Findings. 
(a)  Smoking creates the hazard of injury to the personal health of those in the environment of such smoke as well as the potential of damage to property that may result from the incendiary nature of such activity. It has been determined that breathing ambient smoke is a health hazard to both smokers and nonsmokers. Cigarette smoking also produces several substances that are considered hazardous to health including carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, nitrous oxide and formaldehyde. Secondhand smoke (68 percent of the total smoke produced by a cigarette) affects the health of the bystander, interfering with respiratory tract defenses, often causing nonsmokers to have allergic or irritative reactions, and is a known cause of lung cancer. 
(b)  Because the hazards of smoking have a potentially harmful effect, material and direct, on the public health, safety, welfare, comfort, and property of residents of the city, it is necessary and desirable to establish regulations that prohibit smoking in all enclosed public places, in all enclosed places of employment, near entrances to all such public places and places of employment, in and near open-air public dining areas, and within certain unenclosed public places. The corporate authorities of the city adopt the findings, conclusions and reports of the Surgeon General of the United States regarding the effects of secondhand smoke as further support for this chapter. 
(c)  Alternative tobacco and nicotine delivery products have recently become available to the public in the commercial market. E-cigarettes, or vapor cigarettes, are an alternative nicotine product which contains nicotine and other chemicals which are turned into a vapor or steam that is inhaled by the user and then exhaled. Although there is limited research on their health risks, the United States Food and Drug Administration notes that the solution used in e-cigarettes contains toxic chemicals found in antifreeze and several other cancer-causing chemicals, such as nitrosamines. 
(d)  The concentration of these chemicals in e-cigarettes is not definitively known; the potential harmful effects and addictiveness appear to vary based upon the brand and degree of vaporization selected by the user. Research illustrates that nicotine can affect brain development in children and teens. The vapor emitted by e-cigarettes is in aerosol form that has the capacity to deeply penetrate lung cells and the cellular lining of the organs made up of these cells. 
(e)  An article published in the New England Journal of Medicine reported a study performed using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy which permitted researchers to look at vape aerosol after vaping. The researchers found that the pre-vaping liquid breaks down into formaldehyde and that the reaction between an electronic aerosolizer, propylene glycol, glycerol and formaldehyde creates a formaldehyde-releasing agent called formaldehyde hemiacetals, which are known as industrial biocides. Although small amounts of formaldehyde are not dangerous, higher levels are strongly associated with certain cancers, according to the international agency for research on cancer, making it one of 114 compounds known as carcinogens. The city council adopts these findings in the New England Journal of Medicine as a basis to support these amendments.

Sec. 58-71. - Driveway approaches-Construction generally. 
(a)  No driveway approach shall be constructed with a width greater than 24 feet for one-car and two-car garages in residential districts, 28 feet for three-car garages in residential districts, or 30 feet in commercial or industrial districts, measured at the property line or at the beginning of the required flare, whichever is further from the street. For approaches in residential districts, there shall be a minimum flare on each side at the curb cut of three feet on minor streets and six feet on collector and arterial streets as designated by the city traffic engineer. The flare shall commence at a point seven feet from the back of the curb. Commercial and industrial approaches shall have a flare having a minimum radius of 15 feet commencing 15 feet from the back of the curb. Unidirectional approaches at each end of required parallel access easements shall be encouraged and subject to the approval of the traffic engineer consistent with good engineering practices. 
(b)  No driveway approach shall extend past the back of the curb or at the edge of the street into the pavement so as to change the street grade at the gutter line. Depressed curb shall be permitted in areas with roll type curb where a driveway approach is to be reconstructed. Curb and gutter of the barrier type shall be horizontally sawcut or the entire curb and gutter removed and replaced such that the back of the curb at the driveway depression is a minimum of 11/2 inches above the gutter line at all places. The depression shall be the full width of the approach at its street edge and shall meet the existing curb at a vertical angle not less than 135 degrees. Residential driveway approaches shall be constructed of Portland cement concrete (Illinois Department of Transportation Class SI) not less than five inches thick or of 11/2 inches minimum thickness of bituminous concrete on a compacted granular base not less than eight inches thick. Commercial and industrial driveway approaches shall be constructed of Portland cement concrete (Illinois Department of Transportation Class SI) not less than six inches thick. The limits of all pavement and concrete construction shall be against sawcut joints. The grade of the driveway approach shall be such that it crosses the location of an existing or proposed sidewalk in accordance with the grades set forth in this Code for sidewalks. For the purpose of determining grades for driveway approaches, it shall be presumed that sidewalks are proposed on all streets within the area of planning jurisdiction of the city. Portland cement concrete approaches shall be separated from adjacent sidewalks and curbing at the back of the curb by approved expansion joint material, finished with a light broom finish, and coated with an approved curing compound immediately after finishing. 
(c)  Reconstruction of existing approaches shall be in conformance with the specifications set out in this section. Reconstruction shall be defined as the removal and replacement of more than 50 percent of the existing surface. Any curb and gutter falling within the required curb depression area which does not meet these specifications or is in a substantial state of disrepair shall be removed and replaced as described in this section, as determined by an authorized city inspector. Removal of such existing curb and gutter shall be by the department of public works within a reasonable period of time after the issuance of a permit for the work and request by the applicant for such removal. The cost of the replacement of the curb and gutter section shall be borne by the applicant. 
(d)  Drive approaches. Drive approaches consisting of decorative materials or finishes may be constructed for residential lots only. Decorative drive approaches shall consist of clay or concrete brick pavers, dyed and stamped Portland cement concrete or bituminous concrete, or other such materials or finishes as may be approved by the director of engineering. Decorative drive approaches shall be subject to the following conditions: 
(1)  Permit. No person shall install a decorative drive approach without having secured a permit from the city. 
(2)  Maintenance by property owner. The owner of the property which is served by the decorative drive approach shall be solely responsible for all maintenance and repair of the decorative drive approach within the city right-of-way. Specifically, the owner shall maintain the decorative drive approach within the right-of-way so that the materials remain securely in place and generally level. The city shall not be liable for the costs of any maintenance or repairs to the decorative drive approach regardless of the reason requiring the maintenance or repair. 
(3)  No maintenance or repair obligation by the city. The city shall have no obligation or responsibility to maintain or repair the decorative drive approach within the city right-of-way; provided, however, in the event the owner fails to maintain and repair the decorative drive approach within the city right-of-way, the city may, but need not, perform the necessary maintenance and repair to the decorative drive approach, at the expense of the owner. The city shall not perform any discretionary maintenance or repair to the decorative drive approach within the city right-of-way without first providing 14 days' written notice to the owner. 
(4)  Restoration obligations. In the event it becomes necessary for the city or its contractors to perform any maintenance or repairs within the city right-of-way, the owner agrees that by taking out a permit, the city or its contractors may remove or dig up the decorative drive approach within the right-of-way without notice to the owner. In this event, neither the city nor its contractors shall have any obligation to replace, repair, or otherwise reconstruct the decorative drive approach; the responsibility and the cost thereof shall be the obligation of the owner. The director of public works or the director of engineering may, however, authorize a partial cost reimbursement which would reflect the city's cost to repair the disturbed portion of the decorative drive approach with asphalt. 
(5)  Release, hold harmless, and indemnification. The owner, the applicant taking out a permit on behalf of the owner, and the owner's heirs, successors and assigns hereby releases and forever discharges the city, its officers, employees, assigns, successors and/or agents from any and all claims, demands, damages, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expert witness costs), loss of services, actions, and causes of action on account of death or injury to any person or damage to any property resulting from any condition of the decorative drive approach being located within the city right-of-way. The owner, the applicant taking out such permit further agrees on behalf of the owner, and the owners' heirs, successors, and assigns to defend and indemnify the city, its officers, employees, assigns, successors and/or agents for any and all claims, demands, damages, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expert witness costs), loss of services, actions, and causes of action on account of death or injury to any person or damage to any property resulting from any condition of the decorative drive approach. This release and indemnification shall be applicable to all successor owners or lessees of any property which is serviced by a decorative drive approach.

(b)  Construction standards. Residential sidewalks shall be constructed of Portland cement concrete (Illinois Department of Transportation Class SI) and shall be not less than 41/2 feet wide and four inches thick, except where sidewalk repairs are being made to existing walks which are of a narrower width; such repairs may, at the discretion of the city engineer, match the width of the existing work. The thickness shall be increased to not less than five inches where driveways cross the sidewalk. The sidewalk shall have scored transverse joints at equal spacings not to exceed five feet or less than four feet spacing. The limits of all sidewalk construction shall be against sawcut joints along the scored transverse joints. Sidewalk construction of more than 50 square feet shall have expansion joint material at its limits. Any fill required under the sidewalk shall be crushed stone or bank run gravel. Pea gravel shall not be permitted. Such fill shall be mechanically compacted. Any vegetation under the sidewalk area shall be removed prior to the placement of the sidewalk or fill. The sidewalk shall be finished with a light broom finish and all exposed surfaces shall be coated with an approved curing compound immediately after finishing. 
(c)  Service and carriage walks.

ARTICLE IV. - VACATION PROCEDURE 

Sec. 58-136. - Findings. 
    The city has acquired certain rights of public way by subdivision dedication, easements, purchase, and otherwise; the city recognizes there are occasions whereby it is disadvantageous to improve such rights-of-way for public streets or alleys. The city further recognizes that in certain instances such public way is created by taking a portion of the private land on either side thereof, and a present owner of land on one or both sides of such public way may desire to restore such land to private taxable use. 
(Code 1968, § 20-139; Code 1996, § 58-136; Ord. No. F-1136, § 1, 2-21-2006) 
Sec. 58-137. - Policy determined. 
    The city, in making its findings under this article, elects to create a uniform policy to determine a fair and just compensation for the city's vacation of its unnecessary public ways. 
(Code 1968, § 20-140; Code 1996, § 58-137; Ord. No. F-1136, § 1, 2-21-2006) 
Sec. 58-138. - Compensation formula. 
(a)  The city adopts the following formula to determine fair and just compensation for vacation of streets, alleys or public ways: 
(1)  Fair and just compensation determined by a certified appraiser (MIA) hired by the city for the following: 
a.  Public ways adding lot width of 25 percent or more to an adjoining property; 
b.  Public ways with land area greater than 3,600 square feet; or 
c.  Public ways of any size that would be vacated to an adjoining property that is zoned other than R-1, R-2, R-3, or R-4. 
(2)  The petitioner shall deposit with the city $2,500.00 to cover the cost of the appraisal and shall be responsible for the actual cost of the appraisal. Should the petitioner request to withdraw the vacation petition before the appraisal is ordered, the deposit will be refunded in full. 
(3)  Public ways not meeting the characteristics set forth in subsection (a)(1) of this section shall have fair and just compensation determined on a square foot basis by the average of the unimproved land value of the adjoining properties as established by the township assessor's most recent evaluation. If the public way adjoins property which has no value (tax exempt), the average of the unimproved land value as established by the township assessor's most recent evaluation of the nearest two similar properties shall be used. Should the city determine the unimproved land value as established by the township assessor is not representative of fair and just compensation, fair and just compensation shall be determined as provided for by subsection (a)(1) of this section. 
(4)  No fair and just compensation shall be required for public ways that necessitate a permanent easement over the entire public way land area. 
(b)  If required by the city, the petitioner/owner shall sign a restrictive covenant reciting that the vacated public street, alley, or public way shall be used consistent with the use represented in the vacation petition. The restrictive covenant shall be in a form approved by the city attorney.

(a)  Any person abutting any public streets, alleys or rights-of-way within the city limits who wishes to institute proceedings for the vacation of such street, alley or public way shall file with the city clerk a written petition setting forth the following information: 
(1)  The name and address of the petitioner; 
(2)  A complete disclosure of interest of the ownership of petitioner's property, including the names of the trustees and the beneficial owners of such property; if such property is owned by a corporation, a disclosure of the shareholders of such corporation including the names of the officers and directors of such corporation; 
(3)  The common description of the street, alley or public way to be vacated as well as the legal description thereof; 
(4)  The names and addresses of all property owners within 250 feet of the street, alley or public way to be vacated; 
(5)  A plat of vacation for any vacation of any portion of a street, alley, or public way less than one block in length, unless such portion consists of the entire street, alley or public way; or when the city determines that such a plat is necessary to fully describe the vacation; and 
(6)  A statement as to the type of any known public service facilities (electric, gas, water, sewer, telecommunications, etc.) over, under, or upon the public way, and the name of the public utility owning the same. 
(b)  The fee for a vacation petition shall be in accordance with appendix B to this Code.

Sec. 58-229. - Effect of permit. 
(a)  Authority granted; no property right or other interest created . A permit from the City authorizes a Permittee to undertake only certain activities in accordance with City ordinances to the extent of the City's property rights therein. The permit shall not create a property right or grant authority to the Permittee to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the Public Ways, including, but not limited to, such rights as may exist by virtue of the Illinois Highway Code (605 ILCS 5/9-113). 
(b)  Compliance with all laws required . The issuance of a permit by the City does not excuse the Permittee from complying with other requirements of the City code, and all other applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations. 
(Code 1996, § 58-229; Ord. No. F-1323, § 1, 12-3-2007; Ord. No. F-1953, § 1, 8-1-2016) 
Sec. 58-230. - Revised permit plans. 
    In the event the actual size, type, material, or location of any Facilities deviate in a minor way with respect to the size, type, material, or location identified in the plans, drawings and specifications submitted with the permit application, the Permittee shall request a Field Change from the City Engineer and shall thereafter submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the City within 30 days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall specifically identify where the locations of the actual Facilities deviate from the locations approved in the permit. This Section shall not be used as a substitute for non-field variations. If the City Engineer deems a variation to be major or material, it shall be subject to approval or rejection by the Corporate Authorities of the City. If any such proposed deviation does not satisfy the requirements of the definition of a Field Change, it shall be treated as a request for a variance in accordance with section 58-244 of this Article. If the City denies the request for a variance, then the Permittee shall, within 30 days of said denial, either remove the Facility from the Public Way or modify the Facility so that it conforms to the permit and submit revised drawings or plans therefore. Any reasonable out of pocket costs, including outside engineering fees, attorney's fees, documents preparation fees, court reporters fees, and notice or publication fees incurred by the City as a result of the installation of a Facility in violation of this Article, and for which no variation is granted, shall be paid to the City prior to the issuance of any other permits to the person or Entity violating the Article.

(Ord. No. O-2018-40, § 1, 8-6-2018) 
Sec. 58-266. - Alternate placements. 
    With respect to an application for the collocation of a small wireless facility associated with a new utility pole, the City may propose that the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or existing wireless support structure within 100 feet of the proposed collocation, which the applicant shall accept if it has the right to use the alternate structure on reasonable terms and conditions, and the alternate location and structure does not impose technical limits or additional material costs as determined by the applicant. 
    If the applicant refuses a collocation proposed by the city it shall provide written certification describing the property rights, technical limits or material cost reasons that render the alternative location unsatisfactory pursuant to the criteria in this section. It shall be the burden of the applicant, by presentation of legally competent evidence, to establish that the city's alternative proposed collocation imposes technical limits or additional material costs that render the alternative collocation unreasonable. 
(Ord. No. O-2018-40, § 1, 8-6-2018) 
Sec. 58-267. - Height limitations. 
    The maximum height of a small wireless facility which qualifies as a permitted use under section 58-252 of this article shall be no more than ten feet above the utility pole or wireless support structure on which the small wireless facility is collocated. 
(1)  If an applicant proposes a height in excess of ten feet above a utility pole or wireless support structure on which the small wireless facility is proposed for installation, the applicant shall apply for a variation. The variation application shall require public notice as set forth in section 5.7(A)(2) of the Wheaton Zoning Ordinance and a public hearing. All publication costs shall be born by the applicant. Hearing of the variation application shall be set before the city council. It shall be the burden of the applicant requesting the variation to establish that the proposed variation in height: 
a.  Is technically necessary to provide service; 
b.  Is not merely for the convenience of the applicant; 
c.  Is due to unique circumstances or that the variation, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the locality; 
d.  Is due to the particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical conditions of the proposed location which would bring a particular hardship upon the applicant if the height variation is not granted; 
e.  Has not been the result of conditions created by the applicant; 
f.  Will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located; and 
g.  Will not endanger the public safety or substantially diminish or impair property values within 100 feet of the proposed height variation. 
(2)  The variation hearing shall be heard by the city council and may be continued from time to time to allow a thorough exposition of evidence associated with the variation standards described herein. A variance when granted shall limit the height of any proposed wireless facility to the higher of: 
a.  Ten feet in height above the tallest existing utility pole, other than a utility pole supporting only wireless facilities, that is in place on the date the application is submitted to the city, that is located within 300 feet of the new or replacement utility pole or wireless support structure and that is in the same right-of-way within the jurisdictional boundary of the city, provided the city may designate which intersecting right-of-way within 300 feet of the proposed utility pole or wireless support structures shall control the height limitation for such facility; or 
b.  Forty-five feet above ground level. 
(Ord. No. O-2018-40, § 1, 8-6-2018) 
Sec. 58-268. - Requirements. 
(a)  A wireless provider shall install small wireless facilities of the type and frequency that will not cause unacceptable interference with a public safety agency's communications equipment. The wireless provider's operation of the small wireless facilities shall not interfere with the frequencies used by a public safety agency for public safety communications. 
Unacceptable interference will be determined by and measured in accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum licensed by a public safety agency. 
If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless provider has been given written notice of the interference by the city or public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall remedy the problem in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution procedures for interference with public safety spectrum established by the FCC including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675. 
The city may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such interference if the wireless provider is not complying with the Code of Federal Regulations cited above. The burden to establish the good faith effort shall be on the wireless provider which shall timely deliver to the city all information necessary to determine its efforts to resolve the interference consistent with the sections of the Codes of Federal Regulations cited above. Failure to remedy the problem as required herein shall constitute a public nuisance and violation of this section subjecting the wireless provider to injunctive relief as well as fines consistent with the City Code. 
(b)  The wireless provider shall comply with requirements that are imposed by a contract between the city and a private property owner that concern design or construction standards applicable to utility poles, such as planned unit development agreements, subdivision improvement agreements and annexation agreements; wireless support structures; and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way. 
(c)  The wireless provider shall comply with spacing requirements in applicable codes and ordinances concerning the location of ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way. Ground mounted utility facilities as defined in article VIII of this chapter 58 in the right-of-way shall not be considered a small wireless facility and shall comply with the requirements of article VIII of this chapter. 
(d)  The wireless provider shall comply with local code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements that prohibit the installation of new utility pole or the modification of existing utility poles in a right-of-way unless it complies with the city's design standards. If a permit is denied based on a conclusion that the proposed design does not comply with this article, an applicant may appeal to the city council following the procedures and standards set forth in section 58-267 of this article. 
(e)  The wireless provider shall comply with generally applicable standards adopted by the city that are consistent with 50 ILCS 835/1 et seq. pertaining to construction and public safety in the rights-of-way and article VIII of chapter 58 of the City Code, including, but not limited to, reasonable and nondiscriminatory wiring and cabling requirements, grounding requirements, utility pole extension requirements and signage limitations; and shall comply with reasonable nondiscriminatory requirements that are consistent with 50 ILCS 835/1 et seq. and adopted by the city regulating the location, size, surface area and height of small wireless facilities, or the abandonment and removal of small wireless facilities. 
(f)  The wireless provider shall not collocate small wireless facilities on city utility poles that are part of an electric distribution or transmission system within the communication worker safety zone of the utility pole or the electric supply zone of the utility pole. 
However, the antenna and support equipment of the small wireless facility may be located in the communications space on the city utility pole and on the top of the utility pole, if not otherwise unavailable, if the wireless provider complies with applicable codes for work involving the top of the utility pole. 
For purposes of this subparagraph (f), the terms "communications space", "communication worker safety zone", and "electric supply zone" have the meanings given to those terms in the National Electric Safety Code as published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. 
(g)  For small wireless facilities installations on city traffic signals or street lighting poles, the wireless provider shall accept all maintenance responsibility of the city's traffic signal or street lighting equipment for the duration of the installation activity. The transfer of protection, operation and maintenance shall be to a qualified contractor that is prequalified by IDOT in the Electrical category. All traffic signal maintenance activity shall be completed by personnel certified by IMSA as a Level II Traffic Signal Technician. Any subsequent routine maintenance and/or modification to the wireless telecommunications facility may require a maintenance transfer of the city's traffic signal or lighting equipment at the discretion of city engineer or his/her duly authorized designee. 
(h)  The wireless provider shall comply with all applicable codes and local code provisions or regulations of general application that concern public safety. 
(i)  The wireless provider shall comply with written design standards for decorative utility poles or reasonable concealment and aesthetic requirements set forth in section 58-269 of this article. 
(j)  Subject to the subsection titled permitted use, and except for facilities excluded from evaluation for effects on historic properties under 47 CFR 1.1307(a)(4), the city requires reasonable, technically feasible and non-discriminatory design or concealment measures for historic landmarks. 
(k)  Any such design or concealment measures, including restrictions on a specific category of poles, may not have the effect of prohibiting any provider's technology. Such design and concealment measures shall not be considered a part of the small wireless facility for purposes of the size restrictions of a small wireless facility. Any applicant who maintains that the design standards prohibit its technology may apply for a design standard variation and shall have the burden of providing legally competent evidence that the effect of the regulations is to prohibit that provider's technology. Variation applications and procedures shall be consistent with section 58-267 of this article. The availability of small wireless facility concealment or design technology in the general marketplace, consistent with the standards set forth in section 58-269, shall be prima facia evidence that the design and concealment measures required by this section are commercially reasonable and do not prohibit a provider's technology. The provider, however, shall have the right to refute the prima facia conclusion of reasonableness by clear and convincing evidence. 
(Ord. No. O-2018-40, § 1, 8-6-2018) 
Sec. 58-269. - Design standard. 
(a)  Small wireless facilities located in the following areas of the city shall be subject to the design standards as described in this section. The intent of these design standards is to minimize the negative aesthetic impact which the city has concluded will occur if these standards were not imposed. The standards are intended to provide flexibility based upon products available in the market which satisfy the conditions of these design standards. Denial of a permit application which city staff determines is inconsistent with these design standards may be appealed by the applicant to the city council, pursuant to the procedures and standards set forth in sections 58-267 and 58-269 of this article. The city's design standards shall apply in the following geographic areas or environs (hereinafter "designated areas"):

The new wireless provider shall have all the obligations and privileges enjoyed by the former wireless provider under the permit, if any, and all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations, including this article, with respect to the work and small wireless facilities in the right-of-way. 
(b)  Transfer of ownership. No transfer of ownership for small wireless facilities requiring a license agreement or supplement shall become effective until the purchaser enters into a license agreement with the city. 
(c)  Amended permit. A wireless provider shall request that any current permit be amended to show current ownership. If the wireless provider fails to have a new or amended permit issued in its name, the new owner shall be presumed to have accepted, and agreed to be bound by, the terms and conditions of the permit if the new owner uses the small wireless facility or allows it to remain on the city's right-of-way. 
(d)  Insurance and security fund. Insurance as required herein shall be changed or replaced to reflect the name of the new wireless provider no less than 30 days after a change of ownership, identity or legal status. 
(Ord. No. O-2018-40, § 1, 8-6-2018) 
Sec. 58-279. - Effect of permit. 
(a)  Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A permit from the city licenses a permittee to undertake only certain activities in accordance with city ordinances to the extent of the city's property rights therein. The permit shall not create a property right or grant authority to the wireless provider to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the right-of-ways, including, but not limited to, such rights as may exist by virtue of the Illinois Highway Code (605 ILCS 5/9-113). 
(b)  Compliance with all laws required. The issuance of a permit by the city does not relieve the wireless provider from complying with other requirements of the City Code, and all other applicable statutes, laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.

Where the subdivision or development is small and the resulting site is too small to be practical, or when available land is inappropriate for park or school sites, or where park or school sites have already been provided, the city council, on the advice of the appropriate district, may require, by resolution, the payment of cash contributions in lieu of the required land dedications. 
(b)  Disposition of contribution in lieu of park site. Any cash contribution in lieu of park land dedication shall be paid directly to the city prior to the recording of the final plat. The cash contribution shall be held in a segregated account by the city solely for the acquisition of park land or the improvement of existing or purchased park land which will be available to serve the needs of the residents of that subdivision or development. In addition to the foregoing requirements, it is also required that the cash contribution be expended for the acquisition of park land or the improvement of existing or purchased park land within the corporate boundaries or planning area of the city. 
(c)  Disposition of contribution in lieu of school site. Any cash contribution in lieu of school site dedication shall be paid directly to the city prior to the recording of the final plat. The cash contribution shall be held in a segregated account by the city solely for the acquisition or improvement of a school building, the acquisition or improvement of a school site or the improvement of areas adjacent to a school which serves the needs of children from the subdivision or development. In addition to the foregoing requirements, it is required that the cash contribution be expended for the acquisition of school site land or for the construction or improvement of a school building within the corporate boundaries or planning area of the city. 
(d)  Utilization of contribution if not expended. If any portion of the cash contribution in lieu of park or school site dedication is not expended for the purposes set forth in this section within ten years from the date of receipt, it shall be returned on a proportionate basis to those parties who are then the successor title holders of record to the property, subdivision or development which generated the cash contribution. 
(e)  Amount of cash contribution. 
(1)  The cash contributions in lieu of land shall be based on the fair market value of the land within the development that otherwise would have been dedicated for park and school sites. The fair market value of vacant land in and near the city is hereby determined to be $150,000.00 per acre, which shall be used in the calculation of the required cash contribution, except as follows: 
a.  If the city council determines that the specifies of the subdivision or development so warrant, it may require a formal appraisal. 
b.  If the subdivider files a written objection to the use of $150,000.00 per acre value, the subdivider shall submit a formal appraisal. 
c.  When a home or number of existing homes are removed as part of a subdivision or development, the applicant shall be responsible for donations for any net increase in the number of homes and/or bedrooms within homes to be constructed on the subject property, from the number of homes and/or bedrooms previously existing on the property. 
(2)  Such appraisals shall show the fair market value of the land in the area of the subdivision. Final determination of the fair market value per acre of land shall be made by the city council, based upon the appraisal or appraisals, and upon other information which may be submitted by park districts, school districts or others. The subdivider shall pay all appraisal fees. When any cash contribution is required prior to recording of the final plat, the contribution shall be based upon a four-bedroom detached single-family dwelling, a two-bedroom attached family dwelling, or a two-bedroom apartment dwelling, unless building plans have been previously submitted and are on file with the city indicating the exact number of bedrooms to be constructed within each specific dwelling unit. Adjustments to the initial cash contribution shall be made at the time of issuance of the building permit. 
(f)  Criteria for requiring dedication and contribution. There may be situations in subdivisions or planned unit developments when a combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land are both necessary. The city council, on the advice of the affected district, may require a combination of dedication of land and contribution of cash in the following situations: 
(1)  When a previously designated park or school site lies partly within and partly outside of a proposed subdivision of PUD, and the size of that part of the designated park or school site within the subdivision or PUD is less than the required dedication, then the subdivider shall dedicate that portion of the park or school site lying within the proposed subdivision or PUD and contribute cash in lieu of the additional land needed to fulfill the dedication requirements. 
(2)  When a part of a park or school site has already been acquired, and the land needed to complete it to be dedicated by the subdivider is less than the required dedication, then the subdivider shall dedicate the amount of land needed from the subdivision or PUD to complete the park or school site and contribute cash in lieu of the additional land needed to fulfill the dedication requirements. 
(3)  When the subdivider will be dedicating land for certain park or school sites, and the balance of the required dedication would be too small or otherwise unsuitable for park or school sites, then the subdivider shall contribute cash in lieu of the additional land needed to fulfill the dedication requirements. 
(Code 1996, § 62-329; Ord. No. F-0663, § 3, 11-19-2001) 
Sec. 62-330. - Calculation of estimated population. 
    The table of estimated ultimate population per dwelling unit, attached to the ordinance from which this article is derived as exhibit A, shall be used to calculate the amount of required dedications and contributions. A written objection to exhibit A may be filed by the subdivider, or by the affected district. This objection shall consist of a demographic study showing the estimated ultimate population to be generated by the subdivision. Final determination of the estimated ultimate population shall be made by the city council, which may base its decision upon the objector's demographic study, and upon other studies which may be submitted by the park district, school district, or others. It is recognized that population density, age distribution, and local conditions change over time, and that, therefore, exhibit A is subject to periodic review and amendment as necessary. The number of bedrooms in a dwelling unit shall be determined in accordance with the definition of bedroom in section 62-3. 
(Code 1996, § 62-330; Ord. No. F-0663, § 3, 11-19-2001) 
Sec. 62-331. - Reservation of additional land. 
    Whenever the comprehensive plan, or the standards of the city, school district, or park district call for a larger school or park site in a particular subdivision or PUD than the subdivider is required to dedicate, the land needed beyond the developer's contribution shall be reserved for subsequent purchase by the city or other public body designated by the city on the final plat of subdivision prior to final approval by the city council. The city or such public body designated by the city shall acquire the land so designated by purchase or commence proceedings to acquire such land by condemnation within one year from the date of approval of the final plat. If the city or other such public body does not acquire the land so designated within a period of one year, the land so designated may then be used by the owners thereof in any other manner consistent with this chapter and the zoning ordinance of the city. 
(Code 1996, § 62-331; Ord. No. F-0663, § 3, 11-19-2001) 
Sec. 62-332. - Combining sites with adjoining developments. 
    Where the subdivision or planned unit development is less than 40 acres, public open space or a school site which is to be dedicated should be combined with the dedications from adjoining or nearby developments in order to produce usable recreation areas or school sites without hardship on a particular subdivision. 
(Code 1996, § 62-332; Ord. No. F-0663, § 3, 11-19-2001) 
Sec. 62-333. - Condition of park sites to be dedicated. 
    The slope, topography, and soils of the dedicated park site and its surroundings must be suitable for recreational use, as determined by the city council on the advice of the appropriate district. Park sites shall be fine graded, provided with four inches to six inches of topsoil, and seeded, subject to the approval of the affected district, prior to written acceptance. Public improvements adjoining the park site shall be the responsibility of the subdivider. Road access, water service, sanitary sewers, and appropriate drainage facilities shall be provided to the site prior to acceptance. 
(Code 1996, § 62-333; Ord. No. F-0663, § 3, 11-19-2001)

    The slope, topography, and soils of the dedicated school site and its surroundings must be suitable for construction of a school, parking facilities, and provision of recreational facilities, as determined by the city council on the advice of the appropriate district. School sites shall be fine graded, provided with four inches to six inches of topsoil, and seeded, subject to the approval of the appropriate district, prior to written acceptance. Public improvements adjacent to the school site shall be the responsibility of the subdivider. Road access, water service, sanitary sewers, and appropriate drainage facilities shall be provided to the site prior to acceptance. 
(Code 1996, § 62-334; Ord. No. F-0663, § 3, 11-19-2001) 
Sec. 62-335. - Real estate donation requirements. 
    All real estate conveyed to the city, school district, or park district pursuant to the provisions of this article shall be designated as public land. Public land is defined as real estate to be conveyed pursuant to this article and to be utilized by the city, school district, and/or park district for uses including, but not limited to, recreational sites, lakes, stormwater retention and detention areas, public forest areas, municipal service areas, public works substations, storage areas and well sites, public natural resource areas, public golf course site areas and other uses, school building sites, and playgrounds. 
(1)  Time of conveyance. The public land shall be conveyed to the appropriate grantee as designated by the city concurrent with the signing of the resolution approving the final plat of subdivision and prior to recording of the final plat of subdivision. Conveyance shall not be deemed to constitute written acceptance for purposes of maintenance. The subdivider shall be responsible for maintaining the public land until such land is accepted for maintenance, in writing. 
(2)  Standards of conveyance. The developer shall furnish the city with a survey of the public land to be conveyed and a preliminary report of title from a title company licensed to do business in the state and acceptable to the city attorney, in the minimum amount such title reports are allowed to be issued by such title company, all without cost to the city. If, within 30 days of receipt of the report of title, the city objects in writing to defects in the title, the developer shall have 30 additional days from the date of delivery of such written objections to cure such defects. The developer shall have all deeds of conveyance pursuant to this article recorded, at its sole expense, in the office of the county recorder of deeds. All conveyances pursuant to this article shall be by warranty or trustee's deed subject only to the following: 
a.  Customary and standard general exceptions included in standard state licensed title company policies of insurance; 
b.  Acts done or suffered by, or judgments against, the grantee, its successors, and assigns; 
c.  General taxes for the year of conveyance and subsequent years;

g.  Rights-of-way for drainage ditches, feeders, laterals, and underground tile, pipe or other conduit; 
h.  Rights of the public, people of the state and the city in and to any part of the public land used for road or highway purposes or drainage systems, including retention or detention areas; 
i.  Any special taxes or assessments levied by the city for improvements not done or completed prior to the date of conveyance. 
(3)  Restrictive covenant, sale of public land. 
a.  All conveyances of public land shall contain a restrictive covenant, in form approved by the city attorney, running with and binding the public land conveyed, providing for the sole and continued use of such real estate as public land, subject to the provisions of this article, in perpetuity, unless the covenant is removed by the city. If either the school district or park district desires to sell any public land, it shall first direct written notice, by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the nonselling district and the city. The written notice shall contain a legal description of the public land and statement that the owner thereof desires to sell the public land described. Upon receipt of the written notice, the following options are provided and granted: 
1.  The nonselling district shall have the exclusive option to purchase the public land described, at no cost, for the 30-day period next following receipt of the notice; 
2.  If the nonselling district fails to exercise its option within the 30-day period, the city shall have the exclusive option to purchase the public land described, at no cost, for the 30-day period next following expiration of the initial 30-day period. 
b.  Within 30 days of receipt of the written notice advising of the intention to sell the described public land, the city shall conduct a public hearing on the issue of the sale. Notice of the public hearing shall be mailed to all owners of real estate, as illustrated on the real estate tax records of the county, within 250 feet of the described public land. In addition, the city may, at its option, publish notice of the public hearing in a newspaper with general circulation in the city. Notice of the public hearing shall be mailed and, if appropriate, published not less than ten days prior to the proposed public hearing. 
c.  Any option shall be exercised by directing written notice to the owner of the public land by certified mail, return receipt requested. If both the nonselling districts and the city, whichever the case may be, fail to exercise their options, the owner of the public land may, for a one-year period thereafter, sell the public land described in the written notice to any third party, subject to the following conditions and restrictions: The purchase price must be the fair market value of the public land. If the public land is not sold within the one-year period, the owner must again comply with the procedural requirements contained in this article. 
d.  If any public land is sold to a third party pursuant to the terms of this article, the restrictive covenant which binds the public land shall be released and removed by the city; provided, however, the restrictive covenant shall not be released until the proposed use and zoning of the public land have been determined, in the manner provided by law. Prior to removal and release of the restrictive covenant, the owner of the public land and the city, and their successors and assigns, shall have the right to enforce such restrictive covenant. 
e.  The cash received by the school district as a result of the sale of public land shall be held in a separate trust account, solely for the improvement of a school site or for construction or improvement of a school building, to serve the immediate or future needs of children from that subdivision or development wherein the public land was located. 
f.  The cash received by the park district as a result of the sale of public land shall be held in a separate trust account solely for the improvement of existing local park land to serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of that subdivision or development wherein the public land was located. 
(4)  Payment of general real estate taxes and agricultural rollback taxes. General real estate taxes and agricultural rollback taxes levied or which become due because of any conveyance against the public land which is conveyed shall be the responsibility and obligation of the grantor. The grantor shall furnish evidence of payment of these taxes or deposit the amount of these taxes in escrow with the title company furnishing the preliminary report of title, requiring payment of the taxes when they become due. After payment of the taxes, evidence of such payment shall be furnished to the city. The amount of any general real estate taxes and/or agricultural rollback taxes for the year of conveyance shall be prorated to the date of the delivery of deed to the city. The amount of the general real estate and agricultural rollback taxes shall be based on the assessor's latest known rate, value, and equalizer, if any, for the open space being conveyed.

Sec. 62-336. - Applicability. 
    If any subdivision subject to the terms of this article is located outside of the city limits of the city, and if the county has an ordinance which is more restrictive, or which would require a greater dedication or contribution than this article, as determined by the city, the ordinance of the county shall prevail where inconsistent with the less restrictive provisions of this article.

Any tax required to be collected by this article and any such tax collected by such tax collector shall constitute a debt owed by the tax collector to the city. Retailers shall collect the tax from the purchaser by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications, or of selling or supplying gas when sold for use, in the manner prescribed in this article.

(1)  For the purposes of this chapter, any partial payment of a billed amount not specifically identified by the purchaser shall be deemed to be for the delivery of telecommunications, gas or electricity. Such tax shall constitute a debt of the purchaser to the retailer or deliverer who provides such taxable services until paid and, if unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for such taxable services. If the retailer or deliverer fails to collect the tax from the purchaser, then the purchaser shall be required to pay the tax directly to the city treasurer. 
(2)  Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this article shall, when collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross charge for telecommunications, gas, or electricity. 
(b)  Each tax collector shall on a monthly basis file a return in a form prescribed by the city treasurer. The return and accompanying remittance shall be due on or before the last day of the month following the month during which the tax is collected or is required to be collected pursuant to this article. The return shall include the tax collector's name and principal place of business, the gross charges during the collection period upon which the tax is imposed, the amount of tax, and such other reasonable and related information as the city may require. The tax collector making the return provided for in this article shall, at the time of making such return, pay to the city treasurer the amount of tax imposed in this article; provided, that in connection with any return the tax collector may, if he so elects, report and pay an amount based upon his total billings of gross charges subject to the tax during the period for which the return is made, exclusive of any amounts previously billed, with prompt adjustments or later payments based upon any differences between such billings and the taxable gross charges. 
(c)  If it shall appear that an amount of tax has been paid which was not due under the provisions of this article, whether the result of a mistake of fact or an error of law, then such amount shall be credited against any tax due or to become due under this article from the tax collector who made the erroneous payment, provided that no amounts erroneously paid more than one year prior to the filing of a claim therefor shall be so credited. No action to recover any amount of tax due under the provisions of this article shall be commenced more than one year after the due date of such amount. 
(d)  Any tax collector who fails to make a return, or who makes a fraudulent return, or who willfully violates any other provision of this article, is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be subject to a fine of not less than $100.00 or more than $500.00, and in addition shall be liable in a civil action for the amount of tax due.

(a)  If a person who originates or receives telecommunications or gas or electricity in this city claims to be a reseller of such telecommunications or gas or electricity, such person shall apply to the city for a resale number, and shall state facts which will show why such applicant is not liable for any tax imposed by this article on any of such purchases, and shall furnish such additional information as the city may reasonably require. 
(b)  Upon approval of the application for a resale number under this section, the city shall assign a resale number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The city may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation, or which is used to send or receive such telecommunications or to sell or supply gas or electricity tax-free when such actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer apply because of the person's having discontinued the making of resales. 
(c)  Except as provided in this section, the act or privilege of sending or receiving telecommunications in the state or of selling or supplying gas or electricity in this city shall not be made tax-free on the grounds of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active resale number from the city and furnishes that number to the retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is nontaxable because of being a sale for resale. 
(d)  If a reseller has acquired electricity partly for use or consumption and partly for resale, the reseller shall pay the tax imposed by this article directly to the city pursuant to section 66-225 on the amount of electricity that the reseller uses or consumes, and shall collect tax pursuant to section 66-225 on the amount of electricity delivered by the reseller to a purchaser.

f.  Charges for telecommunications and all services and equipment provided in connection therewith between a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries when the tax imposed under this article has already been paid to a retailer and only to the extent that the charges between the parent corporation and wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries represent expense allocation between the corporations and not the generation of profit for the corporation rendering such service; 
g.  Bad debts ("bad debt" means any portion of a debt that is related to a sale at retail for which gross charges are not otherwise deductible or excludable that has become worthless or uncollectible, as determined under applicable federal income tax standards; if the portion of the debt deemed to be bad is subsequently paid, the retailer shall report and pay the tax on that portion during the reporting period in which the payment is made);

    Purchase at retail means the acquisition, consumption or use of telecommunications through a sale at retail. 
    Retailer means and includes every person engaged in the business of making sales at retail as defined in this section. The department may, in its discretion, upon application, authorize the collection of the tax hereby imposed by any retailer not maintaining a place of business within this state, who, to the satisfaction of the department, furnishes adequate security to ensure collection and payment of the tax. Such retailer shall be issued, without charge, a permit to collect such tax. When so authorized, it shall be the duty of such retailer to collect the tax upon all of the gross charges for telecommunications in this state in the same manner and subject to the same requirements as a retailer maintaining a place of business within this state. The permit may be revoked by the department at its discretion. 
    Retailer maintaining a place of business in this state or any like term, means and includes any retailer having or maintaining within this state, directly or by a subsidiary, an office, distribution facilities, transmission facilities, sales office, warehouse or other place of business, or any agent or other representative operating within this state under the authority of the retailer or its subsidiary, irrespective of whether such place of business or agent or other representative is located here permanently or temporarily, or whether such retailer or subsidiary is licensed to do business in this state. 
    Sale at retail means the transmitting, supplying or furnishing of telecommunications and all services and equipment provided in connection therewith for a consideration, to persons other than the federal and state governments, and state universities created by statute and other than between a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries or between wholly owned subsidiaries for their use or consumption and not for resale.

For air-to-ground systems and the like, the term "service address" shall mean the location of a taxpayer's primary use of the telecommunications equipment as defined by telephone number, authorization code, or location in the state where bills are sent. 
    Taxpayer means a person who individually or through his agents, employees, or permittees engages in the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in a municipality and who incurs a tax liability as authorized by this article. 
    Telecommunications. 
(1)  The term "telecommunications," in addition to the meaning ordinarily and popularly ascribed to it, includes, without limitation, messages or information transmitted through use of local, toll, and wide area telephone service, private line services, channel services, telegraph services, teletypewriter, computer exchange services, cellular mobile telecommunications service, specialized mobile radio, stationary two-way radio, paging service, or any other form of mobile and portable one-way or two-way communications, or any other transmission of messages or information by electronic or similar means, between or among points by wire, cable, fiber optics, laser, microwave, radio, satellite, or similar facilities. As used in this article, the term "private line" means a dedicated non-traffic sensitive service for a single customer, that entitles the customer to exclusive or priority use of a communications channel or group of channels, from one or more specified locations to one or more other specified locations.

(4)  Carrier access charges, right of access charges, charges for use of inter-company facilities, and all telecommunications resold in the subsequent provision of, used as a component of, or integrated into, end-to-end telecommunications service shall be non-taxable as sales for resale. 
(5)  Prepaid telephone calling arrangements shall not be considered "telecommunications" subject to the tax imposed under this article. For purposes of this section, the term "prepaid telephone calling arrangements" means that term as defined in section 2-27 of the Retailers' Occupations Tax Act. 
(Code 1996, § 66-301; Ord. No. F-0755, § 4, 9-3-2002)

(1)  The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving in the municipality intrastate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six percent of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail from a retailer. 
(2)  The act or privilege of originating in the municipality or receiving in the municipality interstate telecommunications by a person at a rate of six percent of the gross charge for such telecommunications purchased at retail from a retailer. To prevent actual multi-state taxation of the act or privilege that is subject to taxation under this subsection, any taxpayer, upon proof that the taxpayer has paid a tax in another state on such event, shall be allowed a credit against any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this section to the extent of the amount of such tax properly due and paid in such other state which was not previously allowed as a credit against any other state or local tax in this state. 
(3)  The tax imposed by this article is not imposed on such act or privilege to the extent such act or privilege may not, under the Constitution and statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by the municipality. 
(Code 1996, § 66-302; Ord. No. F-0755, § 4, 9-3-2002) 
Sec. 66-303. - Collection of tax by retailers. 
(a)  The tax authorized by this article shall be collected from the taxpayer by a retailer maintaining a place of business in this state and shall be remitted by such retailer to the department. Any tax required to be collected pursuant to or as authorized by this article and any such tax collected by such retailer and required to be remitted to the department shall constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the state. Retailers shall collect the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner prescribed by the department. The tax authorized by this article shall constitute a debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and, if unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original charge for such sale at retail. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the department in the manner provided by the department. 
(b)  Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this article shall, when collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross charge for telecommunications.

Sec. 66-305. - Resellers. 
(a)  If a person who originates or receives telecommunications claims to be a reseller of such telecommunications, such person shall apply to the department for a resale number. Such applicant shall state facts which will show the department why such applicant is not liable for the tax authorized by this article on any of such purchases and shall furnish such additional information as the department may reasonably require. 
(b)  Upon approval of the application, the department shall assign a resale number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The department may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation, or which is used to send or receive such telecommunication tax-free when such actions in fact are not for resale, or which no longer applies because of the person's having discontinued the making of resales. 
(c)  Except as provided hereinabove in this section, the act or privilege of originating or receiving telecommunications in this state shall not be made tax-free on the ground of being a sale for resale unless the person has an active resale number from the department and furnishes that number to the retailer in connection with certifying to the retailer that any sale to such person is non-taxable because of being a sale for resale.

No extension fee shall be charged against any property for any water and/or sewer main for which any owner of that property has previously and directly borne the pro rata share of such cost. 
a.  Single-family dwellings. The charge shall be based on the lot width, as defined in the zoning ordinance, of the property served multiplied by a rate per foot. The rate per foot shall be 50 percent of the cost of a six-inch water main or an eight-inch sewer main at the time of installation. If the improvement cost is not paid within 90 days of construction acceptance, then an interest rate of six percent per annum shall be charged to date of payment.

If the city engineer determines that a main larger than eight inches is required, the city reserves the right to enter into a separate contract with the user. In no case, however, shall the charge be based on the cost of a main greater than the main to which the service is connected. 
(2)  Connection privilege fees. 
a.  To ensure that each user shall bear a share of the cost of the basic city water system, a connection privilege fee shall be charged each user at the time connection to an existing water service is made, in accordance with appendix B to this Code. 
b.  The estimates of water usage made by the city engineer shall be based upon average 24-hour rates of water consumption of comparable building uses. Fees based on such estimates may be adjusted on the basis of the first year's experience upon application of the user or the city. No adjustment shall result in a fee less than the minimum fee as referred to in this subsection (2).

b.  Hydrant meter deposits will be refunded upon return of the hydrant meter. All damages shall be billed to the person responsible for the meter. 
(6)  Additional costs incurred. Nothing contained in this section shall preclude or bar the city from recovering unforeseen or excessive and uncontemplated construction costs incurred by the city in performing any of the services set forth in this section; the city is obliged to give prompt notice to the user of such unforeseen or uncontemplated costs as soon as they become evident and afford such user the opportunity to cancel any further work. 
(7)  Emergency call-outs.

    If at any time a user contends that the water meter is not registering correctly or if the user contends that his water bill is excessive due to malfunctioning plumbing equipment, the following procedures will be followed: 
(1)  Improperly registering water meter: 
a.  An employee will be sent to the premises to physically check the meter reading and to check the plumbing for problems. If there is a discrepancy in the meter reading between the inside water meter and the remote readout device, the inside water meter reading shall be used for billing purposes, unless it is determined by the water superintendent that the readout device was registering properly. 
b.  If the meter reading was correct, and if no obvious plumbing problems are located, the serviceman will, upon the customer's request, conduct a field test of the meter. If the meter is recording inaccurately, the meter will be removed and the property owner's bill will be adjusted accordingly. 
c.  If the field test indicates that the meter is recording accurately, the property owner has two choices: 
1.  Pay the total water bill. 
2.  Request that further tests be conducted. 
d.  If the customer requests further testing, a deposit of $30.00 for meters of the size of five-eighths-inch through one-inch will be required. 
e.  If a customer with a meter of 11/2 inches or larger requests testing the deposit will be as follows: 
1.  One and one-half inches, $75.00. 
2.  Two inches, $200.00. 
3.  Three inches, $200.00. 
4.  Four inches, $200.00. 
f.  If the independent company's test determines that the meter was recording inaccurately, the deposit will be returned to the property owner and the high bill will be adjusted accordingly. 
g.  If the independent company's test determines that the meter is recording accurately, the property owner shall forfeit the deposit and has two options: 
1.  Pay the total bill. 
2.  Appear before the excessive water bill review committee and plead his case. 
h.  The excessive water bill review committee shall consist of two members of the city council and a member of the water division staff. The excessive water bill review committee shall review all cases before it and will make final determination concerning the water bills. 
(2)  Excessive water bill: 
a.  A water bill will only be considered excessive if the amount of the bill is five times greater than the average of the last two years' water bills for the same two-month time period from actual read to actual read. 
b.  The excessive water bill review committee, as provided for in subsection (1)h of this section, shall review all cases presented to it under this subsection (2) and shall make final determinations concerning the water bill in accordance with the following: 
1.  The administrative staff shall provide the excessive water bill review committee with all information relating to why the water bill is excessive. 
2.  Each case will be considered independently. 
3.  If an excessive bill is caused by carelessness (e.g., neglecting to shut off outside sprinkler), the committee has the right to deny an adjustment to the water bill. 
4.  If the committee adjusts a water bill, the adjusted bill shall never be less than what the city paid the county water commission for the water used. 
5.  If an adjustment is made to the water bill, the user will be required to complete the payment of the bill within three months. If the user chooses not to have his excessive bill adjusted, he may make installment payments on the bill up to one year. 
6.  If the user neglects to make repairs to malfunctioning plumbing equipment, a second adjustment to the water bill will not be made.

The posted notice shall be photographed by city staff and placed in the property file. The posted notice shall identify the property by common description, and the location of the hazard removed or abated. The failure of the city to record such notice of lien or to mail such notice, or the failure of the owner of the affected real estate to receive such notice, shall not affect the city's right to foreclose the lien for unpaid bills for hazard removal or abatement, as provided for in the following provision. The lien shall run with the land and shall be superior to all liens other than tax liens or the liens of any mortgage, judgment creditor, or other lienor whose rights in and to the real estate affected arose before the filing of the city's notice of lien. The lien amount and associated hazard removal or abatement fees, if not already included in the lien amount, shall be paid in full prior to the city's release of the lien.

Sec. 78-95. - Notice of violation and demand to abate; abatement of nuisance; lien procedures. 
(a)  Notice of violation and demand to abate. 
(1)  If the director of the building and code enforcement department or his duly authorized designee shall find upon inspection that weeds, grass, weed trees or plants are permitted to grow in violation of the provisions of this article, the director of building and code enforcement or his designee shall serve or cause to be served upon the owner of the premises a written notice to abate the nuisance within ten days. Such notice shall specify the condition constituting the nuisance. 
(2)  If upon diligent search, the identity or whereabouts of the property owner of any real estate containing the nuisance cannot be ascertained, the notice to abate provided for in this section shall be posted near the main entrance of the structure on the property or in a conspicuous place on the property. 
(3)  It shall be unlawful for anyone to deface, tamper with, or remove the "Notice of Violation" from the property where it is posted unless authorized by the city. 
(b)  Removal by city. If any nuisance under this article IV is not abated within ten days after the service of or posting of the notice as provided in this article, the director of building and code enforcement or his designee may proceed to abate the nuisance at the owner's expense and in so doing the director is authorized to cut, mow, or otherwise destroy the weeds, grasses, weed trees and/or plants constituting the nuisance. The city shall have the right, but not the obligation, to secure an independent contractor to cut, mow, or otherwise destroy the weeds, grasses, weed trees and/or plants constituting the violation. All costs incurred by the city for causing the cutting, mowing, or destruction of the weeds, grasses and/or plants shall be charged to the property and/ or owner and shall be considered a debt owed to the city. The director of finance is further authorized to charge the property and/or owner a fee to cover the administrative costs incurred by the city associated with the abatement of the nuisance, including any subsequent lien filing fees and lien removal costs, and all such costs shall be considered a debt. 
(c)  Lien procedures. All unpaid costs incurred by the city for causing the cutting, mowing, or destruction of the weeds, grasses, weed trees and/or other plants in an effort to abate the nuisance, and related fees, shall constitute a lien upon the real estate affected, superior to all other liens and encumbrances, except tax liens or the liens of any mortgage, judgment creditor, or other lienor whose rights in and to the real estate affected arose before the filing of the city's notice of lien; provided that within one year after the city incurs costs associated with its abatement of the nuisance, the city or the independent contractor performing the abatement services for the city, in its or his/her own name, files notice of lien in the office of the recorder of deeds for DuPage County. 
(1)  Whenever a bill for abatement costs and administrative fees, addressed to the property owner of the affected real estate, remains unpaid after 30 days, the city shall send a statement to the property owner of the affected real estate along with a letter stating that the failure to pay within ten days of the date printed on the statement may result in the city's filing of a lien upon the real estate affected in accordance with this article. 
(2)  When a property owner fails to pay in accordance with subparagraph (c)(1) of this section, the city may file a notice of lien with the DuPage County Recorder of Deeds. The notice of lien shall consist of a sworn statement reciting a description of the real estate sufficient for the identification thereof, the amount of money representing the costs and expense incurred by the city or the independent contractor for the service and for the removal of any materials utilized for the abatement of the nuisance, along with any associated administrative fees, and the date or dates when such costs and expense were incurred by the city. 
The costs incurred by the city or the independent contractor for the cutting of weeds, grasses, and/or plants, and for other abatement services and disposal of any materials shall not be a lien on the affected real estate unless recorded at the recorder of deeds office. Upon recording, a notice of that recording shall be personally served on, or sent by regular mail to the owner. If the regular mail is returned as undeliverable, the notice of lien shall be posted at the property in general conformance with section 78-95(a)(2) of this article. The posted notices shall be photographed by city staff and placed in the property file. The posted notice shall identify the property by common description, and the location of the weeds, grasses, and/or plants to be cut. The failure of the city to record such notice of lien or to mail such notice, or the failure of the owner of the affected real estate to receive such notice, shall not affect the right to foreclose the lien for unpaid bills for nuisance abatement expense, as provided for in the following provision. The lien shall run with the land and shall be superior to all liens other than tax liens or the liens of any mortgage, judgment creditor, or other lienor whose rights in and to the real estate affected arose before the filing of the city's notice of lien. The lien amount and any associated abatement fees if not already included in the lien amount, must be paid in full prior to the city's release of the lien. 
(d)  Foreclosure of lien or other collection. The lien provided for in this section may be foreclosed, in the manner provided by law, in any court of competent jurisdiction. Reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred by the city with respect to the filing and foreclosure of the lien shall be taxed against the owner of or persons interested in the real estate. Foreclosure of the lien shall not be the exclusive remedy. The city may implement any lawful means to collect the debt which shall include its reasonable attorney's fees and costs. 
(e)  The city shall file a release of lien with the recorder of deeds after the lien amount is paid in full.

Sec. 78-96. - County's obligation to abate. 
    Nothing contained in this article shall preempt the county government in its obligation to abate noxious weeds as set forth in 505 ILCS 100/1-100/24. 
(Ord. No. O-2018-02, § 4, 1-16-2018)

Economic Development in City Hall and is identified on its face as a part of this
ordinance, and the said Zoning Map with all notations, references, and other matters
thereon, is as much a part of this ordinance as if such notations, references, and other
matters were specifically set forth herein. It is the intent of the City Council that the
entire area of Wheaton, including all land and water areas, streets, alleys and railroad
and other rights-of-ways, be included in the districts established by this ordinance. Any
area not shown on the Wheaton Zoning Map as being included in any district shall be

In the event ambiguities exist with respect to the intended boundaries of the various
districts as shown on the zoning map, the following rules shall apply:
1. The district boundaries are the center lines of streets or alleys unless otherwise
indicated, and where the designation of a boundary line on the zoning map
coincides with the location of a street or alley, the center line of such street or
alley shall be construed to be the boundary of such district.
2. Where the district boundaries do not coincide with the location of streets or alleys
but do coincide with lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be the
boundary of such district.
22
3. Where the district boundaries do not coincide with the location of streets, alleys
or lot lines, the district boundaries shall be determined by scaling the official
zoning map.
3.4 General Regulations
A. Except as hereinafter specifically provided:
1. Not more than one (1) principal residential building shall be located on a
single lot nor shall a principal residential dwelling be located on the same lot
with any other principal building except as may be expressly permitted by
this ordinance.
2. No part of a lot shall be included as a part of a lot required for any other
building, or use, except as herein specifically provided.
3. All of the lot required in connection with any use or structure shall be located
on the same lot as such use or structure except as specifically provided
herein.
4. No part of a lot, yard, open space, off-street parking or loading space
provided in connection with any structure, or use (including, but not limited
to any structure, or use existing on the effective date of this ordinance or of
any amendment thereof) shall subsequently be reduced below, or further
reduced if already less than, the minimum requirement of this ordinance for
equivalent new construction.
5. In any residential district, and for permitted uses in the I-1 District, the
minimum side yard width shall be as follows:
a. The minimum side yard for structures or parts of structures which do
not exceed 1½ stories, shall be the lesser of 8% of the lot width or 10
feet.
b. The minimum side yard for structures or parts of structures in excess
of 1½ stories, shall be the lesser of 14% of the lot width or 15 feet.
c. The minimum side yard width for a side yard adjoining a public street
shall be 20 feet, but shall be only 12 feet if there are no more than
two lots in the block with lot lines facing said public street. Provided,
however, that no side yard adjoining a public street shall be less than
the side yard required by 3.4A-5 a or b.
23
6. The minimum rear yard depth in residential districts, and for permitted uses
in the I-1 District, shall be twenty-five (25) feet.
7. Bay windows, balconies, eaves, chimneys, gutters and down-spouts may
project a maximum of 24 inches (.61 m.) into required front, rear or side
yards.
8. Garages, Storage Sheds and Carports
a. One-story detached garages, storage sheds, and carports more
than forty (40) feet (12.2 m.) behind the required front setback line
shall be set back at least five (5) feet (1.52 m.) from the rear lot line
and at least three (3) feet (.91 m.) from the side lot line, provided
that on a corner lot, the distance from the side street lot line shall
be the same as required for the principal structure on the lot.
b. One and one-half story detached garages more than 40 feet behind
the required setback shall be setback from the side lot line a
distance equal to the lesser of 8% of the lot width or 10 feet, and
setback from the rear lot line a distance equal to the lesser of 8% of
the lot width or 10 feet, but in no case shall the rear yard setback
be less than five feet. On a corner lot, the distance from the side
street lot line shall be the same as required for the principal
structure on the lot.
c. All detached garages, storage sheds, and carports less than forty
(40) feet (12.2 m.) behind the required front setback line shall
comply with the bulk regulations of the district in which they are
located.
d. All detached garages, storage sheds, and carports shall be located
at least four (4) feet (1.22 m.) from the principal structure, and the
intervening space may be roofed but not enclosed.
9. If a lot contains both residential and non-residential uses, the
requirements of this ordinance as to off-street parking, minimum lot size,
and minimum usable open space shall be applied to each use, and then
combined, to determine the minimum standards applicable to the lot.
(Example: A building containing 1200 sq. ft. of office space and 2 dwelling
units in the R-7 district would be required to provide 8 parking spaces, a
14,000 sq. ft. lot, and 1,050 sq .ft. of usable open space).
10. Where two or more contiguous substandard lots of record or parts of
contiguous substandard lots of record are in common ownership and are
of such size as to constitute at least one conforming zoning lot, such lots
of record or portions thereof shall be so joined, developed and used jointly
24
for the purpose of forming an effective and conforming zoning lot(s). Such
contiguous substandard lots of record in common ownership on March 4,
1997 shall be considered jointly thereafter as being a single parcel, lot or
zoning lot for the purpose of this Zoning Ordinance.
B Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance to the contrary:
1. Any vacant lot of record recorded in the office of the County Record of
Deeds prior to January 1, 1967, which was not in common ownership with
surrounding property on or after March 4, 1997, and which does not
conform to the required minimum lot size and width may be used for
single-family residential purposes, only, provided it conforms to all of the
following requirements:
a. The lot of record is not less than fifty feet (50') wide, unless
otherwise permitted pursuant to the applicable bulk regulations or
by variation granted by the City Council; and
b. The subject lot of record cannot be combined with adjoining land to
increase lot width or lot area to meet the minimum lot requirements
for a single family dwelling because:
(1) The necessary adjoining land is public property that is
unavailable for purchase;
(2) The adjoining land is part of an improved zoning lot and is
necessary either to maintain the adjacent improved zoning
lot in conformity with the bulk requirements or to prevent the
improved zoning lot from becoming more non-conforming; or
(3) The applicant has made a good faith effort to obtain
adjoining land, but has not been able to do so; and
c. The subject lot of record fronts on a street and lies between two
intersecting streets where, exclusive of the subject lot of record:
(1) At least seventy-five percent (75%) of the zoning lots fronting
on both sides of the street within the block, including corner
lots, are improved with single-family dwellings; and
(2) At least fifty percent (50%) of the single-family dwellings
fronting on both sides of the street within the block are
constructed on zoning lots with the same or less lot width
and lot area as the subject lot of record. Dwellings on corner
lots of equal or less lot width and/or lot area than the subject
lot of record shall be included in this calculation; dwellings on
25
corner lots of greater lot width and/or lot area than the
subject parcel shall be excluded.
2. Notwithstanding the requirements of the proceeding paragraphs, a new
single family dwelling may be constructed and maintained upon a vacant
lot of record which has less than the minimum lot width and minimum lot
area required by the bulk requirements of said Zoning District and has
been in common ownership with an adjacent lot of record which may be
improved with a single-family dwelling wholly contained on the adjacent
whole lot of record, provided any new single-family dwelling and
accessory structures erected on the subject lot of record conform to all
other bulk requirements of the zoning district in which it is located, and
further provided:
a. At the time of sale or transfer of the subject lot of record which
resulted in a separation of ownership from the adjacent lot of
record, the seller had been the legal or beneficial common owner
of the subject lot and the adjoining lot of record on March 4, 1997.
If the property was held in a trust or land trust on March 4, 1997,
the rights granted in this section shall only apply to a person who
was a beneficial owner under the trust or land trust; and
b. At the time of the above-referenced sale, all of the other conditions
set forth in Subparagraphs 1(a) and (c) of Paragraph 3.4B above
are met. (With regard to 3.4B.1(c-2), the "subject lot of record" is
only the unimproved subject lot of record, and the adjacent lot of
record shall count as an improved zoning lot.); and
c. At such time as a new house is constructed on the vacant lot of
record, the total dimension of the combined adjacent side yards on
the newly developed subject lot of record and the previously
improved adjacent lot of record will meet the total side yard width
requirements of both the newly developed and previously improved
lots of record. By way of example, should the previously improved
adjacent lot of record consist of a one story single-family dwelling
on a fifty foot (50') wide lot with a side yard width adjacent to the
vacant lot of record of two feet (2') (side yard width of four feet (4')
is required), the newly developed subject lot of record, consisting of
a one story single-family dwelling on a fifty foot (50') wide lot, shall
have a side yard width adjacent to the previously improved
adjacent lot of record of six feet (6').
3. Notwithstanding the requirements of the preceding paragraphs of this
Section of the Zoning Code, in the event that a single-family dwelling is
located on a zoning lot which lawfully existed on or which was lawfully
established thereafter, such previously improved zoning lot may continue
26
to be used as a zoning lot for single-family dwelling purposes, and
additions to, enlargements of, extensions of and reconstruction or
replacement of the dwelling shall be permitted, provided all of the following
conditions are met:
a. The lawfully existing zoning lot has a lot width of not less than fifty
feet (50'), unless otherwise permitted by variation granted by the
City Council; and
b. A permit has been issued authorizing demolition and removal of the
existing residential dwelling unit; and
c. Any new construction, additions, enlargements, extensions,
replacements or reconstruction and accessory structures erected
on the lawfully existing zoning lot shall conform to all bulk
requirements of the Zoning District in which it is located and all
ordinances of the City, with the exception of minimum lot width and
minimum lot area requirements.
4. If any lot adjoins one or more of the following streets, all buildings and
canopy structures shall be set back at least seventy (70) feet from the
center line of such street or streets, or twenty (20) feet from the right-ofway
line, whichever is greater. All permanent signs except signs
permitted by Section 22.2, paragraphs 1 through 6, shall be set back a
minimum of fifty (50) feet from the center line of such street or streets, or
ten (10) feet from the right-of-way line, whichever is greater. Provided,
however, that if the district regulations require a greater setback, then they
shall apply.

uses shall require site plan and architectural approval. All wiring
(including transmission, distribution and service lines) for the supply of
electric and communication services shall be placed underground unless
such wiring:
a. Carries more than 15,000 volts, or
b. Is for temporary service during periods of new construction, or
c. Is relocated at the request of the City of Wheaton, or
d. Is for minor repair of existing facilities, or
e. Is lead-in or service wiring from existing poles to single-family
dwellings.
6. A single family dwelling and accessory detached garage, which were
constructed prior to January 1, 1967, may be connected by means of an
addition to the structures or enclosure of an existing breezeway,
notwithstanding any non-conformity in the setback of the existing garage
created by such connection. Any newly enclosed space added under this
provision shall comply with all applicable bulk requirements. Such a
connection is not permitted where the existing garage violates the setback
which would otherwise violate the setback requirements applicable to
attached garages shall be converted to living quarters.
7. A plat of consolidation meeting the requirements of Chapter 62 of the
Wheaton City Code will be required for all applications involving more than
one (1) parcel of property.
C. Screening of Building Utility and Service Installations
1. Ground or Wall Mounted Installations. Loading docks, refuse or
recycling containers and handling systems, HVAC (heating, ventilation,
and air conditioning) equipment and ductwork, communications
equipment, private or public utility substations, transformers and
generators, storage tanks, utility service entrances and meters of all
buildings (except detached single-family dwellings) shall be screened
from all public rights-of-way and from any adjacent residential district at
grade level. Screening may be done in any manner which does not
interfere with the safe and efficient operation of the equipment or
cause equipment or devices to be inaccessible, and shall be the
responsibility of the property owner.
27A
2. Rooftop Installations. HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air
conditioning) equipment and ductwork, solar panels, communications
equipment, and any other mechanical equipment, devices, or ductwork
installed upon or extending beyond or through a roof surface shall be
screened equal in height to said equipment. Screening shall not
interfere with the safe and efficient operation of the equipment or
cause equipment or devices to be inaccessible, and shall be the
responsibility of the property owner.
For all new buildings constructed after September 4, 2007, rooftop
installations shall be screened with a parapet (an extension of the
façade walls above the roof line), a roof structure, or another physical
design element that is integral to the overall appearance of the
building. Where the standard in the preceding sentence is not feasible
for existing buildings constructed before September 4, 2007, a
penthouse, partition screen, or other screening structure may be
utilized, provided the structures are designed to:
a. Minimize the conspicuity of the structure and be centered on
the roof where possible.
b. Complement the building in terms of form, scale, color,
materials, and finish.
c. Encompass groupings of equipment within a single enclosure
where possible.

existing foot-candle requirement included in the performance
standards article of the Zoning Ordinance.
E. Obsolete Special Use and Planned Unit Development Ordinance Requirements:
Properties developed under zoning ordinances of general application that
previously required special use approval, shall no longer be subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in the specific special use ordinances approving those
developments, where subsequent zoning amendments of general application
have repealed the requirement of one or more condition(s) of a special use
permit. Properties in conformance with specific special use requirements which
are no longer applicable in the zoning district generally because the requirements
27B
have been repealed or modified, shall only have to comply with the current
zoning requirements of those districts irrespective of their specific special use
ordinances unless, as determined by the Director of Planning, some specific
condition of the original special use permit remains necessary in order to protect
the public health, safety and welfare in areas of: traffic safety, utility provision
and maintenance, or storm water protection. In the latter instance, the City Staff
shall work with the owner on how to accommodate the public health, safety and
welfare concerns. If agreement cannot be reached the property owner may
submit an application for an amendment to the PUD or special use for the
property in conformance with the procedures set forth in the Zoning Code.
28

article.
4.1 Existing Building Permits
If a building permit has been issued prior to the effective date of this ordinance or
amendments thereto, and provide that construction is begun within six (6) months of the
date of issuance and construction is diligently pursued to completion, the building may
be occupied for the use intended at the time of permit subject to the regulations of this
ordinance as applied to non-conforming buildings.
4.2 New Uses of Existing Buildings
No building or structure or part thereof shall be reconstructed, enlarged, relocated or
structurally altered for a use or occupancy except as permitted by the regulations of this
ordinance and amendments thereto for the zoning district in which such building or
structure is located.
4.3 Existing Special Uses
If a use or occupancy lawfully existed as a conditional use at the time of adoption of this
ordinance or any amendment thereto, such use shall continue as a special use.
However, a further special use authorization shall be required for new construction,
enlargement, relocation or structural alteration of any building occupied for such special
use. If a special use is abandoned for a period of more than eighteen (18) months, the
special use shall become void.
4.4 Granted Special Uses and Variations
Where a special use or variation is granted under the terms of this ordinance, such
special use or variation shall become void unless construction for occupancy is
substantially in progress within twelve (12) months of the date of the issuance of the
special use or variation, except in the case of a Planned Unit Development.
Authorization for a Planned Unit Development shall become null and void according to
the terms of the ordinance granting such authorization.
In the event that the ordinance granting authority for a Planned Unit Development does
not establish any time for commencement and completion, said authority shall expire
three (3) years from the date of the grant of authority or the effective date of this
29
ordinance, whichever is later. Planned Unit Development authority shall expire if work is
not substantially commenced within the applicable period of authorization and diligently
prosecuted. Upon written application and for good cause shown, the corporate
authorities may, in their sole discretion, grant extensions of time not to exceed one year
each.
4.5 Existing Non-Conforming Uses
A lawfully existing non-conforming use of all or part of a building or structure which is
designed or intended for a use permitted in the district in which it is located may be
continued only in accordance with the following regulations:
1. If a lawfully existing non-conforming use is discontinued for a period of six (6)
consecutive months, it shall not thereafter be renewed and any subsequent use
of the building or structure must conform to the use regulations of the district in
which it is located.
2. No non-conforming use shall be changed to another non-conforming use.
3. Whenever a non-conforming use is changed to or replaced by a use conforming
to the provisions of this ordinance, such premises shall not thereafter be used or
occupied by a non-conforming use.
4. The non-conforming use of part of a building or structure shall not be expanded or
extended into any other portion of such building or structure.
5. A building or structure occupied in whole or in part by a lawful non-conforming
use may be repaired, altered or structurally changed provided said repairs,
alterations or structural changes conform to the requirements of the district in
which the building is located.
4.6 Existing Conforming Buildings
Except as may otherwise be provided, no building, or structure or part thereof shall be
reconstructed, enlarged, relocated or structurally altered except in accordance with the
provisions of this ordinance and subsequent amendments thereto and the requirements
of the district in which such building is located.
4.7 Existing Non-Conforming Buildings
A non-conforming building or structure including a building or structure designed or
intended for a use not permitted in the district in which it is located, which existed
lawfully at the time of adoption of this ordinance or amendments thereto and which
remains non-conforming or any such building or structure which shall become nonconforming
upon adoption of this ordinance or any amendment thereto may continue to
be used only in accordance with the following regulations:
30
1. Ordinary repairs and improvements may be made to a non-conforming
building, however, no non-conforming building shall be enlarged or relocated
unless it is made to conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located.
However, if a building is non-conforming only as to bulk, it may be added to or
enlarged if such additions and enlargements conform all the regulations of the
district in which the building is located. A building in a residential district
containing non-conforming residential units or uses may be repaired or altered to
improve living and health conditions provided that the alterations do not result in
an increase in either the bulk of the building or the number of dwelling units.
2. A non-conforming building or structure, or portion thereof, which is damaged or
destroyed by fire, casualty or act of God to the extent that the cost of restoration
will exceed 50% of the cost of replacement of the entire building or structure shall
not be restored, except as required by law or in conformance with the regulations
of the district in which said building or structure is located. The extent of damage
and the cost of restoration shall be determined by a panel consisting of a
representative of the municipality, a representative of the owner and a third

5.7 Variations
5.7.A. Administrative Variations. Any variation to decrease any front yard setback by
less than or equal to 25% or 10 feet, whichever is less, or any minimum side or
rear yard dimension by less than or equal to 25% or five feet, whichever is less,
39
or to increase the maximum height required by the applicable provisions by less
than or equal to 25% or five feet, whichever is less, may be heard and decided
by the Director of Planning & Economic Development as an administrative
variation.
1. Application for Administrative Variation. Any application for an administrative
variation shall be filed with the Director of Planning & Economic Development.
2. Application Form. The application shall contain such information as the
Director of Planning & Economic Development may require.
3. Applicant qualification. Any application shall be filed either by the owner of
record or the contract purchaser of the property to be directly affected
thereby.
Upon review of the application for completeness by the Director of Planning &
Economic Development, the applicant may choose one of the following two methods for
notifying property owners within a one property radius of the subject property:
Notice to Adjacent Owners. A copy of the variation application shall be sent by
certified mail to all property owners within a one property radius of the subject property.
Adjacent Owner Review. The applicant shall review the variation application with
all adjacent property owners within a one property radius of the applicants property
The applicant shall obtain a signed statement along with a signed set of plans from
each adjacent property owner confirming that the owner has no objection to the
requested variation. The applicant shall notify the City in writing if any adjacent property
owner objects to the variation application. The Director of Planning and Economic
Development shall wait at least 15 days from the receipt of signed statements by
adjacent property owners, or notification of objection, before making a determination on
the application.
B. Conditions for Administrative Variation. It shall be a condition precedent to the
granting of an administrative variation that the Director of Planning and Economic
Development determines and concludes that: (i) the variation, if granted, will be in
harmony with the general purpose and intent of the Zoning Ordinance; and (ii) the
applicant seeking the variation has demonstrated and established the following:
1. Hardship. Practical difficulties prevent compliance with the strict application of
the regulations of the zoning ordinance, or that a practical hardship would
result from compliance with the strict application of the requirements of the
zoning ordinance; and
2. Essential Character of the Neighborhood. The variation, if granted, will not
alter the essential character of the area or neighborhood.
40
C. Director of Plannings Review. For purposes of determining whether an
applicant for an administrative variation has satisfied the requirements recited in Section
5.7A(1.) 2.1 and 2.2 of this Ordinance, the Director of Planning and Economic
Development shall take into consideration the extent to which the evidence establishes,
or fails to establish, the factors recited in Section 5.7. B (1) of this Ordinance and
whether or not any written objections to the application have been submitted.
D. Conditions. The Director of Planning & Economic Development may impose
such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by an administrative
variation as may be necessary to comply with the standards recited in this section to
reduce or minimize the injurious effect of such variation upon other property in the
neighborhood, and to better promote and implement the general intent of this chapter.
E. Denial. If the Director of Planning & Economic Development finds the
proposed application does not meet the standards contained herein, the application for
an administrative variation will be denied. Following a denial of an administrative
variation, the applicant may file for a non-administrative variation.
F. Administrative Variation Limitations. No administrative variation shall be valid
unless completed by the Owner within twelve months of its approval. Upon written
application, the Director of Planning & Economic Development may grant a maximum
extension not exceeding one additional year.
5.7.B. Non-administrative Variations. The Board may recommend, and the City
Council may grant, non-administrative variations from the regulations of
this ordinance when such variations are in harmony with the general
purpose and intent of the zoning ordinance. It shall be a condition
precedent to the recommendation of the Board to grant a variation and the
granting of a variation by the City Council that the applicant seeking the
variation demonstrate and establish the following:
1. Hardship. Practical difficulties prevent compliance with the strict
application of the regulations of the zoning ordinance, or a
particular hardship would result from compliance with the strict
application of the requirements of the zoning ordinance; and
2. Essential Character of the Neighborhood. The variation, if
granted, will not alter the essential character of the area or
neighborhood.
5.7.B (1) Variation Evidence. For purposes of determining whether an applicant for a
variation has satisfied the requirements recited in Section 5.7 of this
Ordinance, the Planning and Zoning Board, and the City Council, shall take
into consideration the extent to which the evidence establishes, or fails to
establish, the following:
41
1. The particular physical surroundings shape or topographical condition
of the property involved prevents compliance with the strict application
of the regulations of the zoning ordinance rather than causing a mere
inconvenience if there is compliance with the strict application of the
regulations of the zoning ordinance.
2. The purpose of the variation is not based primarily upon a desire to
enhance the monetary value of the property.
3. The alleged practical difficulty or particular hardship has not been
created by any person presently having any interest, whether financial,
beneficial, legal or other, in the property or by the applicant.
4. The granting of the variation will not be detrimental to the public
welfare, injurious, in any way whether economic, aesthetic or
otherwise, to other property or improvements in the neighborhood
or inconsistent with the general character of the area or
neighborhood.
5. The proposed variation will not:
a. impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property;
b. substantially increase the hazard from fire or other dangers to
the property or adjacent property;
c. otherwise impair the public health, safety or general welfare;
d. diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood;
e. unduly increase traffic congestion in the public streets and
highways;
f. create a nuisance;
g. result in an increase in public expenditure.
6. A denial of the requested variation would potentially allow for the
creation of a more adverse or unintended use, improvement or
consequence because the regulations of the Zoning Ordinance would
allow alternative construction which would potentially have a more
negative impact on the character of the neighborhood than the
construction of the improvement pursuant to the requested variation.
7. The variation is the minimum variation that will make possible the
reasonable use of the land, building or structure.
42
8. In the case of an existing Planned Unit Development, the granting of
the variation will not significantly compromise the character and
concept of the planned unit development.
9. The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if
permitted to be used only under the conditions allowed by the
regulations in that zoning district.
10. That denial of the variation would unreasonably deprive the property
owner of the use and enjoyment of the property.
No single factor recited above shall be controlling or determinative. All
applicable factors shall be weighed and evaluated in an overall determination
of whether the requirements of Section 5.7 have been satisfied.
The Board or the City Council may recommend, and the City Council may
impose, such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a
non-administrative variation as may be necessary to comply with the
standards set out in this section to reduce or minimize the injurious effect of
such variation upon other property in the neighborhood, and to better carry
out the general intent of this chapter.
B (2) Application for Non-Administrative Variation and Notice of Hearing. Any
application for a non-administrative variation shall be filed with the Director of
Planning and Economic Development. The application shall contain such
information as the Director of Planning and Economic Development may
reasonably require. Any application shall be filed by either the owner of
record or the contract purchaser of the property involved. The Director of
Planning and Economic Development shall submit the application to the
Planning and Zoning Board for a public hearing and recommendation. The
Planning and Zoning Board shall submit its recommendation related to the
proposed variation to the City Council as soon as reasonably practical, but in
no event, later than sixty (60) days from the closing of the public hearing, or
within such additional time as may be designated by the City Council. Notice
of the Public Hearing shall be given in accordance with Sections 5.7.7.
B (3) Variation Limitations. A non-administrative variation from the regulations of this
chapter shall be granted by the City Council only in accordance with the standards
set out in Section 5.7B and may be granted only in the following instances, and in no
others:
1. To permit a decrease of greater than twenty-five percent (25%) or five feet in
any setback or any minimum yard dimension or to permit an increase in the
maximum height required by the applicable provisions.
43
2. To permit the use of a lot or lots for use otherwise prohibited solely because
of the insufficient area or width of the lot or lots but in no event shall the
respective area and width of the lots be less than seventy-five percent (75%)
of the required area and width.
3. To reduce the applicable off-street parking or loading spaces for a property
located in the Downtown Parking Overlay District.
4. To reduce the applicable off-street parking or loading facilities required by not
more than one (1) parking space or loading space or twenty percent (20%) of

distance that required parking spaces are permitted to be located from the
use served.
6. To permit overhead wiring for public utility purposes not otherwise permitted
under the regulations of this chapter.
7. To increase the Floor Area Ratio to a maximum of forty-five percent (45%) for
additions to single-family dwellings constructed prior to October 17, 1989, and
for additions to single-family dwellings constructed in the Northside
Residential Overlay District prior to February 7, 2005.
8. For a seasonal parking lot, to permit a reduction in the amount of required
landscaping and/or the elimination of any required lighting.
9. To allow an attached front, side or rear loading garage on a single-family
dwelling in the Northside Residential Overlay District where construction of a
detached garage is not physically possible. In such cases, the total area of
the attached garage, up to 500 square feet, shall not be counted in the gross
floor area calculation for the purpose of calculating the floor area ratio.
A non-administrative variation may be granted by the City Council, by
ordinance, approved by a majority of the members of the City Council
qualified to vote. No non-administrative variation shall be valid unless
completed within 12 months of approval. The City Council may grant a
maximum of two extensions, not exceeding 1 additional year each, upon
written application without notice of hearing, as provided in Section 4.4 of this
ordinance.
5.8 Notice of Hearings

Special Use Permit, planned unit development, or variation (hereinafter
collectively referred to as "Zoning Matters") shall be given by the City Clerk not

where copies of the proposed Zoning Matter may be obtained or examined. If the
Zoning Matter relates to specific property, the notice shall describe the property by
common street address or general location. A Zoning Matter relates to specific
property if it will directly affect less than all the property in any use district.
B. Notice to Adjacent Owners. At the time of the filing of an application for any
amendment, Special Use Permit, Planned Unit Development, or variation relating
to specific property, the applicant shall furnish to the Director of Planning &
Economic Development a complete typewritten list on mailing labels containing

subject property; provided, the number of feet occupied by all public streets,
alleys, and other public ways shall be excluded in computing the 250 foot
requirement. The applicant shall file a sworn affidavit with the list of taxpayers,
certifying that the list is complete and accurate. The Board shall hear no zoning
matter unless the applicant furnishes such information.
C. Owners Not Located. If notice is mailed to an adjacent owner pursuant to Section

recipient thereof cannot be found at the address shown on the notice, the notice
requirement of that paragraph shall be deemed to have been satisfied.
D. Posting of Sign on Subject Property. At least 15 days prior to the public hearing,
the Director of Planning & Economic Development shall cause a sign or signs to
be erected on the subject property, so as to be clearly legible to the public view on

statement to the effect that the property will be the subject of an upcoming zoning
hearing. A telephone number for contacting the Director of Planning & Economic

action appealed from unless the Director of Planning & Economic Development
certifies to the Board, after the notice of appeal has been filed with him, that by

imminent peril to life or property, in which case proceedings shall not be stayed
otherwise than by a restraining order, which may be granted by the Board or by a
court record on application, and notice to the Director of Planning & Economic
Development, and on due cause shown.

that the application provides such information the Director of Economic
Development and Zoning shall notify the applicant to proceed with notice of public
46
hearing in the same manner as provided for amendments to this Ordinance. Upon
proper notice, the Planning and Zoning Board shall conduct such public hearing or
hearings as may be required and necessary to present recommendations to the
City Council. The burden of establishing that the proposed Special Use Permit
satisfies the standards of Section 5.10B of this Ordinance shall be upon the
applicant. The public hearing shall be transcribed at the applicants expense. The
applicant shall prepay all estimated costs of the public hearing. The amount of the
hearing deposit shall be that amount estimated by the Director of Economic
Development/Zoning Director. Any funds remaining, after payment for the costs of
the public hearing, shall be returned to the applicant.

complies with the following standards:
1. The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the special use shall not
be detrimental to the public health, safety, morals, comfort, convenience,
and general welfare;
2. The special use shall not be injurious to the uses and enjoyment of other
property in the immediate vicinity for the purposes already permitted, not
substantially diminish property values within the neighborhood;

5.11 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD)
A. Intent and Purpose. The regulations contained in this section are established
to encourage more creative and imaginative design of coordinated land uses than might
be possible under conventional zoning and subdivision regulations and which offer
enhanced protection of natural resources and sensitive environmental features,
including streams, floodplains, wetlands and woodlands, achieve high levels of energy
conservation and sustainability, offer a range of housing options that offer a variety of
lifestyle choices to meet the needs of different age groups and household types, and/or
contain a complementary mix of residential and nonresidential uses or that provide for a
range of land use types on a single development parcel.
B. Applicability. A Planned Unit Development may only be granted as a special
use in accordance with the procedures and standards of Sections 5.10 and 5.11 in the
following instances:
1. When two or more principal structures on a single zoning lot located in the I-
1, C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, and C-5 Commercial Zoning District is developed.
2. When any lot or parcel, or combination of lots or parcels, over one acre in the
C-2 Retail Core Business District and C-4 CBD Perimeter Commercial District
is developed.
3. When any multifamily project which contains over two units in R-5, over four
units in R- 6, over 12 units in R-7 or C-4 CBD Perimeter Commercial District
is developed.
C. Public Benefit. In addition to the special use permit standards of Sections
5.10 and 5.11, all Planned Unit Developments should demonstrate a public benefit
commensurate with the degree of development flexibility proposed and proportional to
the anticipated impact of the proposed Planned Unit Development on adjacent land
uses and on the community at large.
The applicant shall submit written commentary as part of its Planned Unit Development
application outlining the benefits and any other information the applicant deems relevant
in defining the public benefit component of the proposed Planned Unit Development
application.
The written commentary shall be considered by the Planning and Zoning Board in its
recommendation to the City Council, and the City Council in its deliberation and
legislative determination as to whether the applicants proposed Planned Unit
Development application demonstrates public benefits sufficient to justify the anticipated
impacts of the proposed Planned Unit Development on adjacent land uses and the City
at large.
The factors listed below are not exhaustive of those that may demonstrate public
48
benefit. No single factor shall be controlling or determinative. All applicable factors shall
be weighed and evaluated in an overall determination of whether the requirements of
this section have been satisfied. The following factors shall be addressed by the
applicant when applicable:
1. Public Benefits for Downtown Planned Unit Developments. All proposed
Planned Unit Developments in the C-2 and C-4 Zoning Districts should
enhance and support the character and vitality of the downtown area and
provide improved pedestrian amenities and experiences.

of natural resource areas should provide for preservation and protection of
environmentally sensitive areas, the preservation of structures and areas with
architectural or historical significance, the provision of recreational and open
space areas, and a development pattern which preserves and utilizes natural
topography and geological features, scenic vistas, trees and other vegetation.
4. Public Benefits for Increased Density. Where density greater than that allowed
by the underlying zoning district is proposed, the applicant should demonstrate
that any impact attributable to increased densities will not be detrimental to
adjacent land uses or the City at large.
5. Public Benefits for a Range of Housing Types and/or Uses. Planned Unit
Developments should provide for a range of housing options covering a variety
of lifestyle choices for different age groups and household types, and
complementary mix of residential and nonresidential uses, and range of land
use types on a single parcel where applicable.
6. Comprehensive Plan. The manner in which the proposed PUD promotes the
goals of the Citys comprehensive plan as a public benefit.
7. Other factors. Any other factors as identified by City staff, the Planning and
Zoning Board and the City Council which the Council deems pertinent to the
specific proposed PUD and the purposes of this section.

themes and active and passive open space and landscaped areas. A sale of a portion
of a parcel designated Planned Unit Development may occur only after a final plat of
subdivision is approved and recorded. However, the subdivided parcels shall continue
to be a single Planned Unit Development and require the individual parcel owners to
conform with the previously approved Planned Unit Development.
3. Minimum Site Area. The minimum land area to be developed as a Planned
Unit Development shall be at least the minimum lot area required by the underlying
zoning district. The applicant shall have the burden of establishing that the subject
property is of sufficient size and shape to be planned and developed as a unified whole
capable of meeting the objectives for which Planned Unit Developments may be
established pursuant to this section.
4. Covenants and Restrictions to be Enforceable by the City. All covenants,
deed restrictions, easements, and similar restrictions to be recorded in connection with
the Planned Unit Development shall provide that they may not be modified, removed, or

5.12 Downtown Design Review
A. Establishment and Purpose of the Downtown Design Review Process. The
downtown design review process is hereby established to promote orderly and
compatible development and redevelopment within the Downtown Design Review
Overlay District and to ensure that such development or redevelopment complies
with the approved Wheaton Downtown Design Guidelines which are an appendix
to the Zoning Ordinance.
B. Applicability. Downtown design review is required for all properties located within
the Downtown Design Review Overlay District, except for properties solely
occupied by single-family dwellings and no other use. Any property occupied by a
single-family dwelling that has been converted to a non-residential use shall be
subject to downtown design review. The Character Areas map that is Appendix A
of the Downtown Design Guidelines shall specify the set of guidelines that apply
to the property.
Downtown design approval shall be required prior to the issuance of 1) a sign
permit; 2) a building permit for any construction activity that modifies the exterior
of the building or 3) a site development permit for any site alteration that requires
a permit, and/or changing the exterior color or materials on the building. For
applications that also require the approval of a special use permit, nonadministrative
variation, and/or planned unit development by the City Council, the
downtown design review process may be conducted concurrently with the
applicable discretionary review process or downtown design approval may be a
condition of approval of the special use permit, non-administrative variation,
and/or planned unit development.
C. Application. The application requirements for downtown design review are set
forth in Section 5.5.1, with the exception that all building elevations shall be in
color. In addition, building material samples shall be provided, if required by the
Director of Planning & Economic Development or Downtown Design Review
Board.
D. Authority and Process.
1. Action by the Director of Planning & Economic Development. Prior to
issuance of a sign, building, or site development permit, the Director of
Planning & Economic Development shall review all complete applications
54
for properties located within the Downtown Design Review Overlay District,
except for single-family dwellings, to determine compliance with all
applicable zoning requirements and the approved Downtown Design
Guidelines. Where there are any conflicts between the applicable zoning
requirements and the Downtown Design Guidelines, the more restrictive
shall control. The Director of Planning & Economic Development may
approve or approve with conditions applications for downtown design review
which, in his/her determination, comply with the Downtown Design Review
Guidelines. The Director of Planning & Economic Development shall
forward applications that do not fully comply with the Guidelines for review
by the Downtown Design Review Board. The decision of the Director of
Planning & Economic Development and any conditions shall be issued in
writing within seven (7) days of receiving a complete application.
2. Action by the Downtown Design Review Board. The Downtown Design
Review Board shall consider complete applications that have been
determined by the Director of Planning & Economic Development to not be
in full compliance with the approved Downtown Design Review Guidelines.
A meeting to review the application shall be held within fourteen (14) days of
receiving a request to appear before the Downtown Design Review Board
from the Director of Planning & Economic Development. In considering
applications that do not fully comply with the Downtown Design Guidelines,
the Downtown Design Review Board shall consider the following factors:
a. Compatibility of the proposed development with neighboring
properties;
b. The degree to which the applicant is proposing to comply with the
guidelines;
c. Whether strict adherence to the guidelines is reasonable and/or
achievable for the application in question; and/or
d. Although not in full compliance with the Downtown Design
Guidelines, the application as proposed will substantially improve the
appearance and function of the building and/or site and will enhance
the character of the downtown.
The Downtown Design Review Board may, upon a concurring vote of a
majority of a quorum, approve, approve with conditions, or deny applications
for downtown design review. The decision of the Downtown Design Review
Board and any conditions shall be issued in writing.
D. Appeals to the City Council. Appeals from the decision of the Downtown Design
Review Board shall be forwarded to the City Council for review within thirty (30)
days of the Downtown Design Review Boards decision. The City Council may
55
affirm, or may, by a majority of the City Council, reverse, wholly or in part, or
modify the decision of the Downtown Design Review Board. Where an appeal is
filed for a property that is also under consideration for a special use permit,
planned unit development, and/or variation, the appeal may be heard concurrently
by the City Council as part of the discretionary review process where downtown
design review was conducted concurrently with other review processes. The City
Councils decision and any conditions shall be issued in writing.
E. Review Standards. Decisions by the Director of Planning & Economic
Development or Downtown Design Review Board shall be based on the
applicable Downtown Design Guidelines contained within the adopted Downtown
Design Guidelines document.
F. Emergency Measures. The downtown design review process is not required
when, in the opinion of the Director of Planning & Economic Development, there is
an actual or immediate danger of collapse or failure of a building or structure, or
part thereof, which would endanger life or physically damage adjoining property.
The Director of Planning & Economic Development may also waive the downtown
design review process, when in his/her opinion the proposed work is of such
limited scope so as not to require review.
G. Modifications to Downtown Design Approvals. Modifications or changes to a
downtown design approval, whether proposed by the property owner or required
by the City to protect the public health, safety and welfare, shall require an
application and approval as if for a new application. Submission of a new
application is not required when, in the opinion of the Director of Planning &
Economic Development, the proposed modification or change is of such limited
scope and in sufficient conformance with the downtown design approval so as not
to require a new application, however, the City may require a new or amended
sign, building, or site development permit.
H. Limitations on Downtown Design Approvals. A downtown design approval shall
automatically become null and void unless a building permit is issued and
construction is actually begun within one (1) year of design approval and is
thereafter diligently pursued to completion. However, the Director of Planning &
Economic Development may extend the period by one (1) additional year, upon
request of the property owner.
5.13 Fees. Any Application for a variation, amendment, Special Use Permit, or
Planned Unit Development shall be accompanied by a fee as set forth in the Fee
Schedule, contained in Appendix B of the Wheaton City Code.
The applicant shall also reimburse the City for the costs of the Court Reporter who
shall attend and transcribe every public hearing; the applicant shall also reimburse
the City for the cost of the notification signs required by Section 5.8D, in the
amount as set forth in the Fee Schedule contained in Appendix B of the City
56
Code. Said Court Reporter and sign costs shall be reimbursed to the City prior to
the final disposition of the application.
5.14 Penalties. A person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects, or refuses to comply
with or resists the enforcement of any of the provisions of this chapter shall be
fined not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than two hundred
dollars ($200.00). Each day such a violation or failure to comply is permitted to
exist after notification shall constitute a separate offense.

6.0 Landscaping and Screening.
6.1 Purpose.
The landscaping and screening requirements specified herein are intended to foster
aesthetically pleasing development which will protect and preserve the appearance,
character, general health, safety and welfare of the City of Wheaton. Specifically, these
regulations are intended to increase the compatibility of adjacent uses by requiring a
buffer or screen between uses, and in doing so, minimize the harmful impact of noise,
dust and other debris, motor vehicle headlight glare or other artificial light intrusions and
other objectionable activities or impacts conducted or created by an adjoining or nearby
use.
1. The arrangement of trees and shrubs shall be done in a manner that provides the
maximum visual separation between adjacent land uses. Plant materials should
be massed in groups to achieve a naturalistic and pleasing effect.
2. In the event that it can be demonstrated that existing vegetation meets the intent
of the landscape requirements of this Ordinance, existing vegetation may be
credited for landscape materials required by this Section. Such vegetation shall
meet the specifications for new plant materials and be located within the area for
which credit is allocated. Where credit has been given, the developer shall note
on the landscape plan the landscape materials which would have been required if
the existing vegetation did not exist. If any of the vegetation dies, the developer
shall be required to install the plant materials described in the note.
3. Required screening shall not be interrupted for any reason except for required
walks, driveways, and pedestrian or bicycle paths.
6.2 Landscape Plan.
1. Landscape Plan Required. A landscape plan shall be required and approved for
all projects requiring site plan and architectural approval as setforth in this code.
a. Applicability of Landscaped Area. In cases where this Article requires a
multitude of landscaped areas, only the landscaped area with the more
stringent quantity and quality standards shall be required.
b. Approval. Prior to the approval of plant materials by the Director of Planning
& Economic Development or his authorized designee, a final inspection shall
be made by the landscape architect and the Director of Planning & Economic
56
Development or his authorized designee, and that such architect provide to
the Director of Planning & Economic Development a written statement
certifying that the approved Landscape Plan has been implemented and that
all materials have been planted in accordance with the City's specification.

1. Selection. Planting materials used in conformance with the provisions of this
Section shall be of good quality, and of a species normally grown in Northeastern
Illinois and capable of withstanding the extremes of individual site microclimates.
Size and density at the time of planting and at maturity are additional criteria which
must be considered when selecting plant materials.
57
2. Installation. All landscaping material shall be installed in accordance with the
planting procedures established by the American Association of Nurserymen.
3. Maintenance.
a. Responsibility. The owner of the property, or subsequent owners, shall be
responsible for the maintenance of all landscape materials. Any plant
materials such as shrubs, trees and ground covers which die shall be
replaced forthwith in compliance with the approved landscape plan. All
screening and landscaping should be designed in such a manner as to be
protected from damage by motor vehicles, pedestrians or snow which could
reduce the effectiveness of the screening.
b. Fences and Walls. Fences, walls and other barriers shall be maintained in
good repair.
6.4 Design Criteria.
1. Scale and Nature of Landscape Material. The scale and nature of landscape
material should be appropriate to the site and structures. Larger scaled buildings,
for example, should generally be complemented by plants which will grow to a
larger scale.
2. Selection of Plant Material. Plant material should be selected for its form, texture,
color and concern for its ultimate growth. The use of Silver Maples, Box Elders,
Russian Olives, Lombardy Poplars and other weak wooded species should be
avoided.

58
pond. Such landscaping should include shade and ornamental trees, evergreens,
shrubbery, hedges and/or other live planting materials.
8. Water Conservation. Consideration should be given to planting species of
landscape materials and arranging the landscape materials in such a manner to
promote the conservation of water used for their care.
9. Energy Conservation.
a. Deciduous trees which are sun tolerant should be placed on the south and
west sides of buildings to provide shade from summer sun.
b. Evergreens and other plant materials which are shade tolerant should be
concentrated on the north side of buildings to dissipate the effect of winter
winds.
10. Berming. Earthen berms and existing topography should, whenever practical, be
incorporated into the landscape treatment of a site. Berms shall be stabilized to
prevent erosion and of such a slope to allow maintenance of same.

1. Purpose. It is the intent of this Section to establish regulations limiting the removal
and insuring the replacement of trees from property within the City and, in doing
so, safeguard the ecological and aesthetic environment of the community. These
regulations are further intended to serve to dissuade the unnecessary clearing and
disturbing of land so as to preserve, insofar as practical, the existing natural
vegetation with plant material indigenous to the region, and preserve existing
landscape buffers to minimize the impact of adjoining differing land uses, enhance
66
and protect the integrity of roadway corridors, and reduce the surface heat and
negative visual impact of vehicular use areas.
2. Tree Removal.
a. Approval Required. No tree having a trunk size of six (6) inches or greater in
diameter as measured twelve (12) inches above the established ground
levels, shall be removed from any property requiring site plan and
architectural approval as setforth in this code, or which is the subject of a
petition for a zoning variation, subdivision or annexation to the City, without
written approval from the Director of Planning & Economic Development or
his authorized designee. In cases where only a zoning variation is sought,
only those trees which are to be removed as a result of the construction
which requires the variation shall be subject to these regulations.
Undesirable species of trees such as those described in Article 6.4.2 of this
code shall be exempt from these regulations. The application for tree
removal shall be accompanied by a written statement indicating the reasons
for removal of trees and a general description of the trees to be removed.
b. Conditions of Approval. The Director of Planning & Economic Development
or his authorized designee shall approve all requests for tree removal if one
(1) or more of the following condition is present:
(1) Safety Hazard to Pedestrians or Vehicular Traffic. Necessity to remove
trees which pose a safety hazard to pedestrian or vehicular traffic or
threaten to cause a disruption of public safety.
(2) Safety Hazard to Buildings. Necessity to remove trees which pose a
safety hazard to a building.
(3) Diseased or Weakened Trees. Necessity to remove diseased trees or
trees weakened by age, storm, fire or other injury.
(4) Observe Good Forestry Practice. Necessity to observe good forestry
practice, i.e., the number of healthy trees a given parcel of land will
support.
(5) Location of a Proposed Structure. Necessity to remove trees in order
to locate proposed structure(s) without causing unreasonable economic
hardship.
(6) Grade Changes. Necessity to remove trees in order to provide for
essential grade changes.
c. Replacement Trees. Any trees which have been identified for removal must
be replaced in accordance with the following criteria:
67
(1) Replacement trees shall either:
(a) Equal or exceed the same size caliper as the tree removed; or
(b) Consist of smaller trees, not less than three (3) inches in caliper,
which add up to the caliper of the original tree.
(2) All replacement trees shall be selected from the City's recommended
species list.
(3) Replacement trees shall be documented on the final landscape plan.
(4) Replacement trees may be used for required perimeter yard
landscaping and screening on the subject property.
3. Protection of Existing Trees.
a. Tree Survey. A tree survey shall be submitted at the time of an application
for site plan and architectural approval indicating the location, size and
species (both scientific and common) of all trees located on the parcel with a
trunk size of six (6) inches or greater, as measured twelve (12) inches above
the established ground level.
b. Integration of Existing Trees into Site and Landscape Plans. Subject to the
determination of the Director of Planning & Economic Development, every
reasonable effort shall be made to retain existing trees on the aforementioned
tree survey through the integration of those trees surveyed into the site and
landscape plan for the proposed development. Removal of trees designed
for preservation shall only be allowed by amendment to the approved
landscape plan.
c. Tree Preservation Plan. A tree preservation plan shall be submitted at the
time of an application for site plan and architectural approval indicating, at a
minimum, the location of those trees to be preserved and the methods which
are to be used to preserve such trees. The tree preservation plan shall
specify the following preservation techniques:
(1) Grading, Construction Equipment and Materials. All grading and
construction equipment and materials shall be forbidden from
encroaching upon the trees' drip line.
(2) Materials Detrimental to Trees. Crushed limestone or any other
material which may be detrimental to trees shall not be dumped within
the drip line of any trees nor shall be located at any higher location
68
where drainage toward the tree(s) could conceivably affect the health of
said tree(s).
(3) Storage of Vehicles. No materials or vehicles shall be stored, driven,
or parked within the drip line of any trees.
(4) Installation of Snow Fencing. Snow fencing, or an alternative
temporary barrier, with the written approval of the Director of Planning
& Economic Development or his authorized designee, shall be installed
at the periphery of the tree's drip line to protect trees from root
compaction by the storage of materials or vehicles.
(5) Pruning. Identification of any trees which have to be saved, but which
could be negatively affected during the construction process. All such
trees shall be pruned by a qualified arborist to compensate for root loss
during construction.
d. Preservation Methodology. The methods which are to be used to preserve
those trees shall be clearly specified. If, in the opinion of the Director of
Planning & Economic Development, or his authorized designee the
necessary precautions, as specified in the tree preservation plan for the
development, were not undertaken before or during construction to ensure
the preservation of those trees, the site development permit for the parcel
shall not be issued or, if previously issued, may be revoked until such time as
compliance with the precautions is achieved.
e. The City shall, at its discretion, have the right to retain a professional tree
consultant/forester to review the preservation plans and to submit a written
report to the Director of Planning & Economic Development. All expenses
incurred by the City shall be reimbursed by the developer.
f. The City shall have the right to inspect the subject property at any time during
the construction process, in order to verify that the developer and contractor
have protected trees in accordance with the approved tree preservation plan.
4. Removal of Trees Designated for Preservation. If it is determined by the City that
a tree designated for preservation is destroyed or razed during the construction
process by a deliberate action in violation of the approved tree preservation plan,
such tree shall be replaced with new trees in accordance with the following
exchange rate. City staff may, with just cause, waive the following exchange rate
due to accidental damage to protected trees.
69

For the above, in the event of a fraction of an inch, if the fraction is less than onehalf
(1/2) inch, it may be disregarded. If the fraction is one-half (1/2) or greater, it
shall be counted as one (1) inch.
5. Minimum Size of Replacement Trees. All replacement trees shall be a minimum
trunk size of three (3) inches in diameter, as measured six (6) inches above the
established ground. Any combination of tree sizes three (3) inches in diameter
(24") tree equals two (2) six inch (6") and four (4) three inch (3") tree replacements
or eight (8) three inch (3") replacements.
6. Cash in-lieu of Replacement Trees. If it is determined by the City that an
insufficient area exists which would support any or all of the replacement trees, the
property owner shall contribute 100 percent (100%) of the cost of the replacement
trees to the City.
Said funds shall be used for the sole purpose of planting trees at locations
determined by the City.

1. Escrow Deposit: When new or altered commercial or industrial use or occupancy
is proposed that may, in the opinion of the code enforcement officer, involve a
possible violation of the regulations of this article, then the code enforcement
officer shall as a condition precedent to issuing a permit for such use or
occupancy, require the deposit in escrow of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for a
period of one (1) year from the date of the new or altered use or occupancy. If
during such one-year period the code enforcement officer believes there is
reasonable probability that the regulations of this article are being violated, he may
employ a qualified technician or technicians to perform investigations,
measurements, and analyses to determine whether the regulations of this article
are being violated, and he may pay their reasonable fees out of the
aforementioned escrow deposit, regardless of the outcome of the investigation. If
the reasonable fees of such technician or technicians exceed the amount of any
available escrow deposit, and if a violation of this article is discovered, such fees
may be recovered as a penalty in the same manner as, and in addition to, the
penalties otherwise provided for the violation of this ordinance. Escrow deposits or
remainders of escrow deposits shall be returned to the depositor at the expiration
of the escrow period.
2. Subsequent Investigation: If, after the expiration of the escrow period provided in
Section 25.11(1), the code enforcement officer believes there is a reasonable
probability that any use or occupancy is violating the regulations of this article, he
is hereby empowered to employ a qualified technician or technicians to perform
investigations, measurements and analyses to determine whether or not the
regulations of this article are being violated. In the event that a violation is found
to exist, the violator shall be liable for the reasonable fees of the technicians
employed to perform such investigations, measurements and analyses. Such
fees may be recovered in a penalty in the same manner as, and in addition to, the
penalties otherwise provided for violation of this ordinance.
3. Citizen Complaint: If a complaint is received regarding an alleged violation of any
of the regulations of this Article XXV but the code enforcement officer does not
believe that there is a reasonable probability that such a violation actually exists,
the code enforcement officer shall, as a condition precedent to further
investigation, require the complainant to post an escrow deposit with the City
Collector in an amount not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00) to defray the
cost of employing a qualified technician or technicians to perform such
investigations, measurements and analyses that may be necessary to determine
whether or not such violation exists. In the event that the complaint is
substantiated the escrow deposit shall be refunded to the depositor and the
162
reasonable fees incurred in obtaining a qualified technician or technicians shall be
recovered in the manner provided in Section 25.11(1) or Section 25.11(2). In the
event that the complaint proves unfounded, the fees shall be paid from the
complainant's escrow deposit; any remainder of such deposit shall be refunded to
the complainant.

ARTICLE XXVI
PERSONAL WIRELESS SERVICE FACILITIES
26.1 Purpose.
The purpose of this Article is to establish general guidelines for the siting of Towers,
Antennas, and Personal Wireless Service Facilities. The goal of this Article is to
encourage the location of Towers in non-residential areas and minimize the total
number of Towers and Antennas throughout the community; strongly encourage the
joint use of new and existing Tower sites; encourage users of the Towers and Antennas
to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the
community is minimal; encourage users of Towers and Antennas to configure them in a
manner that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the Towers and Antennas; and
enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such
services to the community quickly, efficiently and effectively.
26.2 Applicability.
No Personal Wireless Service Facilities shall be erected or installed except in
compliance with the provisions of this Article. The provisions of this Article apply to all
Personal Wireless Service Facilities, whether such Facilities are used as a principal use
or as an accessory use. Personal Wireless Service Facilities located on property
owned, leased or otherwise controlled by the City shall be exempt from the
requirements of this Article provided a lease or license authorizing such Personal
Wireless Service Facilities has been approved by City Council. This Article shall not
govern any Tower or installation of any Antenna which is owned and operated by a
Federally licensed amateur radio station operator as part of the Amateur Radio Service,
citizens band radio, or is used exclusively for receive only antennas. Where conflicts
exist between this Article and the remainder of the Zoning Ordinance, the provisions of
this Article shall govern.
26.3 General guidelines and performance standards.
1. Additional use permitted on lot. Antennas and Transmission Towers may be
considered either principal or accessory uses. A different existing use or an
existing structure on the same lot shall not preclude the installation of an Antenna
or Transmission Tower on such lot. For purposes of determining whether the
installation of a Transmission Tower or Antenna complies with district bulk
regulations, including but not limited to set-back and lot requirements, the
dimensions of the entire zoning lot shall control, even though the Antennas or
Transmission Towers may be located on leased property within such zoning lot(s).
2. Federal requirements. All Personal Wireless Service Facilities shall meet or
exceed the current standards and regulations of the Federal Aviation
Administration, Federal Communications Commission, and any other agency of the
160
federal government with the authority to regulate Personal Wireless Service
Facilities. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the owner(s) of the
Personal Wireless Service Facilities shall bring such Facilities into compliance with
such revised standards and regulations within six (6) months of the effective date
of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is
mandated by the controlling federal agency, or unless Personal Wireless Service
Facilities are grandfathered by such revised standard. Failure to bring such
Facilities into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall
constitute grounds for the removal of the Personal Wireless Service Facilities at
the owner's expense.
3. Measuring Height of Personal Wireless Service Facilities. The measurement of
the height of Personal Wireless Service Facilities shall include Antenna, base pad,
and related appurtenances which shall be measured from the crown of the nearest
improved right-of-way.
4. Lighting. No signals or lights or illumination shall be permitted on a Personal
Wireless Service Facility unless required by the Federal Communications
Commission, the Federal Aviation Administration or the City.
5. Signage. No commercial advertising shall be allowed on any Personal Wireless
Service Facility.
6. Compatibility with Structure. Omnidirectional, whip, directional, dish or panel
Antennas when mounted on a building or structure shall be of a material or color
which matches the exterior of the building or structure. Dish, directional, or panel
antennas when mounted on a building, structure or rooftop shall be located or
screened in an aesthetically acceptable manner so as not to be visible from the
adjacent properties and/or right of way. The Director of Planning & Economic
Development shall determine whether dish, directional, or panel antennas mounted
on a building, structure, or rooftop matches the building, structure, or rooftop and is
screened from adjacent right-of-way(s) and/or properties. Dish Antennas attached
to a Transmission Tower shall not exceed forty (40) inches in diameter.
7. Abandonment.. Abandonment will be presumed where a Facility has not been
used for the purpose for which it was installed for a period of sixty (60) consecutive
days, or more, and where there have been no efforts to repair or renew the use
during the 60-day period. The Entity owning, controlling or maintaining the Facility
shall have the burden of establishing to the Director of Planning & Economic
Development that the Facility is still being used within 30 days of the Citys notice
of abandonment. All notices described herein shall be regular U.S. Mail. Failure to
respond to the Director of Planning & Economic Developments request for
information regarding the abandonment of the Facility shall constitute irrefutable
evidence of abandonment. Upon the Director of Planning & Economic
Developments determination and final written notification to the Entity of such
abandonment the Entity shall have sixty (60) days within which to:
161
a.) Reactivate the use of the Facility or transfer the Facility to another
Entity which makes actual use of the Facility promptly; or
b.) Dismantle and remove the Facility and notify the Director of
Planning & Economic Development in writing of the completion of
such removal.
If the Entity believes that the final determination of abandonment by the Director of
Planning & Economic Development is incorrect it may file a written appeal with the
City Manager within five (5) days of the Director of Planning & Economic
Developments final determination. The Director of Planning & Economic
Development shall review the matter, take evidence if deemed necessary, and make
a determination as to whether the Facility has or has not been abandoned. The City
Managers determination shall be final. If the Entity fails to prevail on appeal,
reactivate, transfer to another active user or remove the Facility, the City shall have
the right to have the Facility removed at the Entitys expense. The City shall be
entitled to reimbursement for all costs and expenses associated with the removal
and the storage of any Facility thereafter. If a stored Facility is not picked up from the
City within twenty-eight (28) days of removal, the City may dispose of the Facility in
its discretion. The City at that point will also be entitled to the cost of the disposal
less any value the City secures for the Facility for scrap or resale. In addition, an
administrative fee shall be assessed against the Entity for disposal of the Facility in
an amount equal to the staff time related to all proceedings associated with the
removal and disposal of the Facility. Failure to remove an abandoned Facility in
conformance with this ordinance shall be considered a violation of the Code and
subject to its general penalty provisions. No permit for any work in the City shall be
granted to an Entity including its successors, which owes any some of money to the
City for the removal and disposal of an abandoned Facility.
8. Equipment. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct support of a Personal
Wireless Service Facility shall not be stored or parked on the site of a Personal
Wireless Service Facility unless repairs to such Facility are being made. Backup
generators shall only be operated during power outages and for testing and
maintenance purposes. Noise attenuation measures shall be included to reduce
noise levels. Testing and maintenance of generators shall only take place on
weekdays between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.
9. Substantial written evidence of denial. In the course of reviewing any request for
any approval required under this Article, the Planning and Zoning Board or the City
Council, as the case may be, shall act within a reasonable period of time after the
request is duly filed, taking into account the nature and scope of the request, and
any decision to deny such a request shall be in writing and supported by substantial
evidence contained in a written record.
10.Petition for amendment. Should the application of this Article have the effect of
prohibiting an Entity from providing personal wireless service to all or a portion of the
162
City, such provider may petition the City Council for an amendment to this Article.
The City Council, upon receipt of such a petition, shall promptly undertake review of
the petition and shall make a determination on the petition within a reasonable
period of time, taking into account the nature and scope of the petition and any
decision to deny such a petition shall be in writing and supported by substantial
evidence contained in a written record.
11. Nonconformities. Any Personal Wireless Service Facility installed and operating
prior to the enactment of this Article, which would be prohibited by this Article, shall
be considered a lawful existing non-conforming use and/or structure, as the case
may be, and shall be subject to the rules on Existing Non-Conforming Uses and
Existing Non-conforming Buildings provided in Article 4 of the Zoning Ordinance.
12. Independent technical expert. The Director of Planning & Economic Development
is hereby authorized to employ on behalf of the City an independent technical expert
to review any technical materials submitted including, but not limited to, those
required under this Article. The applicant shall pay all reasonable costs of said
review, including any administrative costs incurred by the City. Hourly rates charged
by the independent technical expert shall not exceed those hourly rates customarily
charged by technical experts within the radio
engineering industry. Any proprietary information disclosed to the City or the expert
hired shall remain confidential and shall not be disclosed to any third party.
26.4 Administrative Approvals.
1. General.

approve the uses listed in this Section 26.4. Nevertheless, all such uses
shall comply with Section 26.3 of this Article and all other applicable
ordinances.
b. Each applicant for administrative approval shall apply to the Director of
Planning & Economic Development, providing the information set forth in
Sections 26.5.2 and 26.5.4 of this Article.
c. The Planning and Economic Development Department shall respond to each
administrative approval application within thirty (30) days after receiving it by
either approving or denying the application. If the Planning and Economic
Development Department fails to respond to the applicant within said thirty
(30) days, then the applicant shall be deemed to be denied. Within fourteen
days (14) of the thirty (30) days, the Planning and Economic Development
Department shall provide written reason for the denial.
d. If an administrative approval is denied, the applicant may appeal said denial
in accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance concerning
appeals of administrative decisions.
163
e. The Director of Planning & Economic Development may refer an application
for administrative approval that meets all of the standards contained herein
to be approved as required by Section 26.5 if the Director of Planning &
Economic Development determines that the location of the proposed
wireless Facility is in close proximity to a principal residential structure in a
residentially zoned district and that the public interest would be furthered by
requiring a Special Use Permit to construct the wireless Facility in question.
2. Specific administratively approved uses. The following uses shall be approved by
the Planning and Economic Development Department after conducting an
administrative review unless the Director of Planning & Economic Development
concludes that the public interest would be furthered by requiring a special use
permit in conformance with Section 26.4.1(5) of this Article.
a. Personal Wireless Service Facilities installed on a Transmission Tower,
including the placement of buildings or other supporting equipment in
connection with said Facilities, in any M-1 Manufacturing or C-5 Planned
Commercial zoning district provided that a Transmission Tower shall not
exceed a height of one hundred five (105) feet and shall be set back from
the closest adjacent residential structure a distance equal to the height of the
tower and further provided that:
(1) A Transmission Tower exceeding fifty (50) feet in height shall not be
located within one-quarter mile (¼) from any existing Transmission
Tower that is over fifty (50) feet in height.
(2) The separation requirement of Section 26.4.2(1)(a) may be waived by
the Director of Planning & Economic Development for the M-1
Manufacturing or C-5 Commercial zoning district provided that the
applicant establishes:
(a) No other site or current technology could be used to provide
intended services to the residents of the City; and
(b) A denial of a permit for the proposed site would create a gap in
providing intended services to the residents of the City; and
(c) The issuance of the permit for the proposed site would
minimize the appearance that towers are clustered within a
quarter-mile area by allowing for co-location.
If one or more of the foregoing factors do not exist the Director of
Planning & Economic Development shall inform the applicant that it
may request a Special Use Permit in conformance with Section 26.5
of this Article.
164
b. Personal Wireless Service Facilities on an existing Utility Pole. Personal
Wireless Service Facilities mounted on Utility Poles shall comply with Above
Ground Service Facilities requirements as set forth herein and subject to the
following conditions:

within 300 feet of another such Personal Wireless Service Facility.
c. Personal Wireless Service Facilities on an existing structure, or replacement
structure which is substantially similar, in any nonresidential district, the R-7
and R-6 districts, and any nonresidential structure (such as a building, sign,
water tower, parking lot light pole or other free-standing structure) in a
residentially zoned district (school, park, or church existing structure) other
than a Transmission Tower so long as said Facilities add no more than
seven (7) feet to the height of the existing structure, or replacement
structure.
d. Personal Wireless Service Facilities on any existing Transmission Tower of
any height including the placement of additional buildings or other supporting
equipment used in connection with said Facility, so long as the addition of
said Facilities adds no more than twenty (20) feet to the height of said
existing Transmission Tower.
26.5 Special Use Permits.
1. General.
The following provisions shall govern the issuance of special use permits.
165
a. If Personal Wireless Service Facilities are not permitted to be approved
administratively pursuant to Section 26.4 of this Article, then a special use
permit shall be required for the construction of Personal Wireless Service
Facilities in all zoning districts except R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, C-2 and C-4,
where such Facilities are prohibited.
b. In granting a special use permit, conditions may be imposed to the extent
that the Planning and Zoning Board and/or City Council concludes are
necessary to minimize any adverse effect of the proposed Personal Wireless
Service Facilities on adjoining properties.
c. In recommending or granting a special use permit, the Planning and Zoning
Board and/or City Council may express a condition requiring that the
applicant allow, on a commercially reasonable and technologically feasible
basis, a minimum of one other provider of Personal Wireless Services to colocate
additional Personal Wireless Service Facilities on a Transmission
Tower which is part of the applicant's proposed Personal Wireless Service
Facility.
d. Any information of an engineering nature that the applicant submits, whether
civil, mechanical, or electrical shall be certified by a licensed professional
engineer.
2. Information required. Each applicant requesting a special use permit under this
Article shall submit an alternative site analysis which identifies all reasonable
technically feasible alternative sites which would provide the proposed services; a
scaled site plan and a scaled elevation view and other supporting drawings,
calculations, and documentation, signed and sealed by appropriate licensed
professionals, showing the location and dimensions of all improvements, including
topography, radio frequency coverage, Transmission Tower height requirements,
setbacks, drives, parking, fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses; and other
information reasonably deemed by the Director of Planning & Economic
Development to be necessary to assess compliance with this Article.
3. Factors considered in granting special use permits. In addition to the standards
identified in Section 5.9.4 of the Zoning Ordinance, the following factors may be
considered in determining whether to issue a special use permit:
a. Height of the proposed Transmission Tower;
b. Proximity of the Transmission Tower to residential structures and residential
district boundaries;
c. Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
d. Surrounding topography;
166
e. Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
f. Design of the Transmission Tower, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual
obtrusiveness; and
g. Demonstrated ability for co-location of Antennas by more than one Personal
Wireless Service carrier on the Facility proposed to be constructed.
Demonstrated ability shall include, but not be limited to, landlord approval if
proposed Transmission Tower site is to be leased, commercially reasonable
sublease agreement, Facility constructed to structurally accept co-locations,
and Transmission Tower site of sufficient size to accept co-locations.
h. Availability of suitable existing Transmission Towers and other structures as
set forth in Section 26.5.4 of this Article.
4. Availability of suitable existing Transmission Towers or other structures. No new
Transmission Tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Planning and Zoning Board and/or City Council that
no existing Transmission Tower or structure can accommodate the applicants
proposed Antenna. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing
Transmission Tower or structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed
antennas may consist of the following:
a. No existing Transmission Towers or structures are located within the
geographic area required to meet applicant's engineering requirements.
b. Existing Transmission Towers or structures are not of sufficient height to
meet applicant's engineering requirements.
c. Existing Transmission Towers or structures do not have sufficient structural
strength to support applicant's proposed Antenna and related equipment.
d. The applicants proposed Antenna would cause electromagnetic interference
with the Antenna on the existing Transmission Towers or structures, or the
Antenna on the existing Transmission Towers or structures would cause
interference with the applicant's proposed Antenna.
e. The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to
share an existing Transmission Tower or structure or to adapt an existing
Transmission Tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs
exceeding new Transmission Tower development are presumed to be
unreasonable.
167
f. The applicants demonstration that there are other limiting factors that render
existing Transmission Towers and structures unsuitable.
5. Setbacks and separation. The following setbacks and separation requirements
shall apply to all Transmission Towers and Antennas for which a special use
permit is required. The standard setbacks and separation requirements may be
reduced if in the opinion of the Planning and Zoning Board and/or City Council the
goals of this Article would be better served thereby.
a. Transmission Towers shall be set back from the closest adjacent residential
principal structure a distance equal to the height of the Transmission Tower
or twenty percent (20%) of the height of the Transmission Tower from the
adjacent property line, whichever is greater.
b. Transmission Towers and accessory Facilities shall satisfy the minimum
zoning district setback requirements.
c. Transmission Towers over fifty (50) feet in height shall not be located within
one-quarter (¼) of a mile from any existing Transmission Tower that is over
fifty (50) feet in height. To minimize adverse visual impacts associated with
the proliferation and clustering of Personal Wireless Service Facilities,
installing Personal Wireless Service Facilities with the demonstrated ability
for co-location of Antennas by more than one Personal Wireless Service
carrier on an existing or new Transmission Tower; and/or technical evidence
acceptable to the Director of Planning & Economic Development concluding
no other site or latest technology could be used to provide the intended
services, and denial of the proposed site would create a gap in providing
services to the residents of the City shall eliminate the separation
requirement.
6. Landscaping. The following requirements shall govern the landscaping
surrounding Personal Wireless Service Facilities requiring a special use permit.
a. Personal Wireless Service Facilities shall be landscaped with a buffer of
plant materials that effectively screens the view of the compound from
adjacent property. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at
least fifteen (15) feet wide from the edge of the compound. In some cases,
such as Facilities sited on large, wooded lots, natural growth around the
property perimeter may be a sufficient buffer.
b. In locations where the visual impact of the Facility would be minimal, the
landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived.
c. Provisions of Section 6.11, Tree Preservation of the Wheaton Zoning
Ordinance.
167
ARTICLE XXVII
DOWNTOWN DESIGN REVIEW OVERLAY DISTRICT
27.1 Purpose and Applicability
The purpose of this Article is to establish an overlay zoning district for Downtown
Wheaton and its periphery. The visual character of Downtown Wheaton is an important
resource that is valued by community residents. Maintaining this character protects
property values and sustains the economic viability of the Downtown. All uses except
single family dwellings shall be subject to the Downtown Design Review Process set
forth in Section 5.12. In the Downtown Design Review Overlay District, the underlying
zoning district requirements and the approved Wheaton Downtown Design Review
Guidelines which are an appendix to the Zoning Ordinance shall apply.
27.2 Permitted and Special Uses
The use provisions of the applicable underlying zoning district shall apply in the
Downtown Design Review Overlay District.
27.3 Bulk Regulations
The bulk regulations of the applicable underlying zoning district shall apply in the
Downtown Design Review Overlay District.
27.4 Standards.
All of the property located in this district is subject to the general standards and
regulations of this ordinance and the Downtown Design Guidelines. To conserve space,
these standards and regulations have not been reprinted in the regulations for each
district. Downtown design review per Section 5.12 is required for all uses except single
family dwellings in the Downtown Design Review Overlay District.
168
ARTICLE XXVIII
NORTHSIDE RESIDENTIAL OVERLAY DISTRICT
28.1 Purpose and Applicability.
The Northside Residential Overlay District is intended to help preserve and enhance the
unique historic character of the Citys northside residential neighborhood and to
enhance property values within this district. This district contains a rich mix of
architectural styles with certain defining elements. The defining elements of this district
include 1) architectural elements such as raised basements, front porches, prominent
front entrances, detached garages placed at the rear of lots, wide roof eaves and an
abundance of other decorative details and 2) siting characteristics such as dwellings
oriented center-front on lots, deep front yard setbacks and wide side yard setbacks.
It is also intended to encourage new construction and, additions or other alterations to
existing single family dwellings that reflect these distinct physical characteristics and are
compatible with the bulk, scale, and siting of existing development within the district. As
such, several incentives are offered as a means of encouraging high quality design that
is consistent with the districts historic character.
The Northside Residential Overlay District requirements and/or bonus provisions apply
in addition to the underlying zoning district regulations. Where these requirements
conflict with the underlying district regulations or other provisions of this ordinance, the
requirements of Article XXVIII shall be controlling.
28.2 Bulk Regulations and Related Incentive Provisions.
A. Detached garages
1. Floor area ratio incentive provision. Because it is a defining element of the
Northside Residential Overlay District, it is the Citys intent to encourage
single family dwellings designed with traditional detached garages located to
the rear of the principal building. Therefore, within the Northside Residential
Overlay District, only detached garages that are located entirely beyond the
principal building in the rear yard shall be excluded from the gross floor area
calculation for the purposes of calculating floor area ratio. The total floor area
of the detached garage shall be excluded, up to 500 square feet. The floor
area of detached garages that are not located beyond the principal building in
the rear yard shall be counted in the gross floor area calculation for the
purposes of calculating floor area ratio. Detached garages shall meet all other
setback, height, and bulk regulations of the underlying zoning district.
B. Attached garages
1. Side or rear loaded incentive provision. In an effort to minimize the appearance
169
of attached garages, a portion of the floor area of attached garages that are
side or rear loaded shall be excluded from the gross floor area for the
purposes of calculating floor area ratio. The total floor area of the side or rear
loaded garage that may be excluded from the gross floor area calculation for
the purpose of calculating floor area ratio is 250 square feet. All attached side
or rear loaded garages must be located at, or behind the front face of the
principal building.
2. Front loading garages. In an effort to minimize the appearance of attached
front loaded garages, the total floor area of attached front loaded garages
shall be counted towards the gross floor area for the purposes of calculating
floor area ratio. All attached front loaded garages must be located at least 5
feet behind the front face of the principal building. On corner lots, an attached
front-loaded garage is any garage which faces the same street as the front
door of the house.
A front loaded attached garage shall not occupy more than one-third of the
front façade of any single family dwelling. This limitation shall not, however,
prevent the construction of a front loaded attached garage less than 22 feet
in width.
C. Porch, deck and patio incentive provision. In an effort to encourage the
construction of front and wrap-around porches in the Northside Residential
Overlay District, unenclosed, roofed front porches shall be permitted to encroach
up to eight (8) feet into the required front yard and side yard abutting a street.
The combined floor area of any unenclosed, roofed front porch and any other
enclosed, roofed porch, deck, and patio not finished for year round use, up to
250 square feet, shall be excluded from the gross floor area calculation for the
purpose of calculating Floor Area Ratio.
D. Raised basement incentive provision. In an effort to encourage the construction
of single family dwellings and additions to existing single family dwellings with
raised basements in the Northside Residential Overlay District, the height of
raised basements less than 3½ feet above existing grade shall not be counted
towards the calculation of a buildings height.
E. Permitted extension of nonconforming side or rear walls. To better allow for
additions to existing single family dwellings in the Northside Residential Overlay
District, nonconforming side or rear walls that do not meet required side or rear
yard setback requirements may be extended without a variation, provided that 1)
the encroachment does not extend beyond the existing building line into the
respective yard (i.e. the degree of nonconformity is not increased) and 2) no
other new nonconformities are created or increased.
170
F. Volume spaces. In order to encourage the construction of new single family
dwellings and additions to existing single family dwellings that better match the
size and character of single family dwellings within the Northside Residential
Overlay District, when any space has a floor to ceiling height of between 12 and
24 feet, such space shall be counted as two floors for the purposes of calculating
the floor area ratio. A space with a floor to ceiling height of more than 24 feet
shall be counted as three floors.
171
ARTICLE XXIX
PROHIBITION AGAINST ANTI COMPETITIVE NEGATIVE USE RESTRICTIONS
Section 29.1 Purpose.
The purpose of this Ordinance is to prohibit establishment of negative use
restrictions on property within the C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5 and M-1 Zoning Districts. This
Ordinance is intended to encourage commercial competition, promote the marketability
of property, reduce the probability of blight and unoccupied commercial space, and
promote the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the City. It is not intended to
regulate restrictions on residential properties within these zoning districts that promote
attainable housing or conservation easements as provided for by 765 ILCS 120/1 et
seq.
Section 29.2 Definition.
"Negative Use Restriction shall not be interpreted to include: 1) provisions in a lease,
purchase and sale agreement, declaration of restrictive covenants and conditions,
condominium declaration, or other instrument, for a multi-tenant building including but
not limited to a shopping center, a strip shopping center, or an outlot located within a
shopping center (hereinafter collectively a "Commercial Structure"), in which a
developer, landlord, owner and/or condominium or property owner association agrees
with an owner, tenant, and/or purchaser (a "Benefitted Party") of a lot, unit, or space
(hereinafter a "Unit") within said Commercial Structure, to grant the exclusive use of
certain uses or types of uses ("Protected Uses") in a Unit within said Commercial
Structure while prohibiting said Protected Uses in another Unit within said Commercial
Structure, although said provisions shall become unenforceable in the event the
Benefitted Party no longer uses the Benefitted Party's Unit for one or more Protected
Uses, and a) the Benefitted Party does not use other space in an area substantially
contiguous to the zoning district in which the Commercial Structure is located for
one or more Protected Uses, or b) the Benefitted Party's Unit is not used by the
Benefitted Party's grantees, successors, or assigns for one or more Protected Uses
within eighteen (18) months of the date the Benefitted Party discontinues its use of the
Benefitted Party's Unit for one or more of the Protected Uses; 2) restrictions imposed on
residential properties within the identified zoning districts that are intended to promote
attainable housing; or 3) qualified conservation easements as provided for by 765 ILCS
120/1 et seq."
Section 29.3 Negative Use Restrictions Prohibited Against Public Policy.
Any Negative Use Restriction imposed on real property within the C-1, C-2, C-3,
C-4, C-5 or M-1 Zoning Districts shall be void and unenforceable unless the City Zoning
Administrator determines that the following factors are present and undertakes the
following action:
172
A. The person or entity proposing a negative use restriction is
substituting a use substantially similar or identical to the use which
is or was on the property for which the negative use restriction is
proposed and the proposed substitute use is within the geographic
area bounded by the zoning district in which the property proposed
for the negative use restriction is located or an area substantially
contiguous to that geographic area which is zoned to allow the
substitute use; and
B. The owner has submitted plans required by the Citys Zoning
Administrator, subdivision regulations, and building ordinances for
the construction of the substitute use; and
C. It is reasonable to conclude that the substitute use shall commence
operations within eighteen (18) months of the discontinuance of the
use on the existing property for which the negative use restriction is
proposed; and
D. Issues a written certificate certifying that the owner or operator has
established the conditions to permit the document containing the
negative use restriction which shall be recorded by the City Clerk at
the Recorder of Deeds at the owner or operators expense.
Section 29.4 Appeal of Denial of Written Certificate.
Any denial by the Zoning Administrator of a written certificate authorizing a
negative use restriction may be appealed to the Corporate Authorities of the City who
may grant the certificate upon a finding that the applicant has satisfied the requirements
of subsections A-C of Section 29.3 of this Ordinance.
Section 29.5 Failure to Complete the Substitute Use.
If the owner/operator of the substitute use has not secured an occupancy permit
within eighteen (18) months of the date of issuance by the Zoning Administrator or
Corporate Authorities of a certificate authorizing a negative use restriction the Zoning
Administrator shall withdraw the certificate allowing the negative use and record the
withdrawal with the Recorder of Deeds. The eighteen months time period may be
extended for up to twenty-four (24) months by the Corporate Authorities of the City upon
good cause shown.
Section 29.6 Maximum Length of Authorized Negative Use Restriction.
No negative use restriction authorized pursuant to section 29.3 of this Ordinance
shall be valid for a period longer than 10 years from the date of issuance of the
certificate of the City Zoning Administrator or Corporate Authorities authorizing the
negative use.
173
Section 29.7 Penalties.
Each day, starting from the date of any agreement, deed or other document
establishing a negative use restriction, prohibited by this Ordinance, whether recorded
or not recorded, shall constitute a separate offense subject to the imposition of a fine
not less than $250.00 nor more than $1,000.00 per day for each day the violation
continues to exist. For recorded negative use restrictions in violation of this Ordinance,
a violation shall only abate upon the recording of a document fully abrogating the
negative use restriction. For non-recorded use restrictions the violation shall abate on
the date that the owner/operator files with the Citys Zoning Administrator a document
fully abrogating the negative use restriction.
174
ARTICLE XXX
ABOVE GROUND SERVICE FACILITIES
30.1 Purpose.
The purpose of this Article is to establish general guidelines for the siting of Above
Ground Service Facilities. The goal of this Article is to encourage the location of Above
Ground Service Facilities in areas that minimize the total number of Above Ground
Service Facilities throughout the community; encourage users of Above Ground Service
Facilities to locate them, to the greatest extent possible, in areas where the adverse
impact on the community is minimal; encourage users of Above Ground Service
Facilities to configure them in a manner that minimizes the adverse visual impact; and
provide the owners of Above Ground Service Facilities the ability to provide such
services to the community.
30.2 Applicability.
No Above Ground Service Facility shall be erected or installed except in compliance
with the provisions of this Article. Above Ground Service Facilities located on property
owned, leased or otherwise controlled by the City shall be exempt from the
requirements of this Article provided a lease, franchise or other written agreement is
entered into after adoption of this ordinance, or where a license authorizing such Above
Ground Service Facilities has been approved by City
Council. Where conflicts exist between this Article and the remainder of the Zoning
Ordinance, the provisions of this Article shall govern.
30.3 Guidelines and Performance Standards.
1. Additional use permitted on lot. For purposes of determining whether the
installation of an Above Ground Service Facility complies with district bulk
regulations, including but not limited to set-back and lot requirements, the
dimensions of the entire zoning lot shall control, even though the Above Ground
Service Facility may be located on leased property within such zoning lot(s).
2. Number of Service Facilities. Only one Above Ground Service Facility may be
located on any zoning lot.
3. Lighting and Color. No visible or audible signals or lights or illumination shall be
permitted on an Above Ground Service Facility. Above Ground Service Facilities
shall be of earth tone colors and be maintained in good condition including but not
limited to being free of peeling paint, and graffiti.
4. Signage. No signs, advertising, or information shall be allowed on any Above
Ground Service Facility, other than a plaque no larger than four inches (4") by six
inches (6") identifying the Above Ground Service Entity.
175
5. Compatibility with Structure. When included as part of an existing building or
structure, the Above Ground Service Facility shall be of a material and color which
substantially matches the exterior of the building or structure and shall be located
or screened in an aesthetically acceptable manner so as not to be visible from any
adjacent property and/or right of way. The Director of Planning & Economic
Development shall determine whether the material and color of an Above Ground
Service Facility mounted on a building, structure, or rooftop matches the building,
structure, or rooftop and is screened from adjacent right-of-way(s) and/or
properties.
6. Abandonment. Abandonment will be presumed where a Facility has not been used
for the purpose for which it was installed for a period of sixty (60) consecutive days
or more, and where there have been no efforts to repair or renew the use during
the sixty (60) day period after written notice of abandonment from the City. The
Entity owning, controlling or maintaining the Facility shall have the burden of
establishing to the Director of Planning & Economic Development that the Facility
is still being used within thirty (30) days of the notice. All notices described herein
shall be regular U.S. Mail. Failure to respond to the Director of Planning &
Economic Developments request for information regarding the abandonment of
the Facility shall constitute irrefutable evidence of abandonment. Upon the Director
of Planning & Economic Developments determination and final written notification
to the Entity of such abandonment the Entity shall have sixty (60) days within
which to:
a.) Reactivate the use of the Facility or transfer the Facility to another
Entity which makes actual use of the Facility promptly; or
b.) Dismantle and remove the Facility and notify the Director of
Planning & Economic Development in writing of the completion of
such removal.
If the Entity believes that the final determination of abandonment by the Director of
Planning & Economic Development is incorrect it may file a written appeal with the
City Manager within five (5) days of the Director of Planning & Economic
Developments final determination. The Director of Planning & Economic
Development shall review the matter, take evidence if deemed necessary, and
make a determination as to whether the Facility has or has not been abandoned.
The City Managers determination shall be final. If the Entity fails to prevail on
appeal, reactivate, transfer to another active user or remove the Facility the City
shall have the right to have the Facility removed at the Entitys expense. The City
shall be entitled to reimbursement for all costs and expenses associated with the
removal and the storage of any Facility thereafter. If a stored Facility is not picked
up from the City within twenty-eight (28) days of removal the City may dispose of
the Facility in its discretion. The City at that point will also be entitled to the cost of
the disposal less any value the City secures for the Facility for scrap or resale. In
addition, an administrative fee shall be assessed against the Entity for disposal of
the Facility in an amount equal to the staff time related to all activities associated
176
with the removal and disposal of the Facility. Failure to remove an abandoned
Facility in conformance with this Ordinance shall be considered a violation of the
Code and subject to its general penalty provisions. No permit for any work in the
City shall be granted to an Entity including its successors, which owes any some of
money to the City for the removal and disposal of an abandoned Facility.
7. Equipment and Non Interference. Mobile or immobile equipment not used in direct
support of an Above Ground Service Facility shall not be stored or parked on the
site of an Above Ground Service Facility unless and while repairs to such Facility
are being made. Backup generators shall only be operated during power outages
and for testing and maintenance purposes and shall not be placed on site except
when in use or where integrated within the Above Ground Service Facilities
cabinet. Noise attenuation measures shall be included to reduce noise levels to
satisfy applicable state and city performance standards. Testing and maintenance
of generators shall only take place on weekdays between the hours of 8:30 a.m.
and 4:30 p.m. Above Ground Service Facilities shall not physically interfere with
access to existing structures or utilities.
8. Substantial written evidence of denial. In the course of reviewing any request for
any approval required under this Article, the Planning and Zoning Commission or
the City Council, as the case may be, shall act within a reasonable period of time
after the request is duly filed, taking into account the nature and scope of the
request, and any decision to deny such a request shall be in writing and supported
by substantial evidence contained in a written record.
9. Petition for amendment. Should the application of this Article have the effect
prohibiting an Entity from providing services to all or a portion of the City, such
provider may petition the City Council for an amendment to this Article. The City
Council, upon receipt of such a petition, shall promptly undertake review of the
petition and shall make a determination on the petition within a reasonable period
of time and shall take into account the nature and scope of the petition and any
decision to deny such a petition shall be in writing and supported by substantial
evidence contained in a written record.
10. Nonconformities. Any Above Ground Service Facility installed and operating prior
to April 3, 2006 (adoption of Ordinance No. F-1151, An Ordinance Establishing A
Temporary Moratorium on the Construction of Certain Ground Mounted Utility
Installations), which would be otherwise prohibited by or subject to this Article,
shall be considered a lawful existing non-conforming use and/or structure, as the
case may be, and shall be subject to the rules on Existing Non-Conforming Uses
and Existing Non-Conforming Buildings provided in Article 4 of the Zoning
Ordinance.
11. Independent technical expert. The Director of Planning & Economic
Development is hereby authorized to employ, on behalf of the City, an
independent technical expert to review any technical materials submitted by the
177
Service Entity or by other participants submitting an application or petition,
including, but not limited to, those materials required under this Article. The
applicant or petitioner shall pay all reasonable costs of said review, including any
administrative costs incurred by the City. Hourly rates charged by the independent
technical expert shall not exceed those hourly rates customarily charged by
similar technical experts within the engineering industry. Any confidential,
proprietary or other such information exempted from disclosure by the Illinois
Freedom of Information Act and disclosed to the City or the expert hired shall
remain confidential and exempted from public disclosure in accordance with the
Illinois Freedom of Information Act.
30.4 Administrative Approvals.
1. General.
a.) The Director of Planning & Economic Development may administratively
approve the uses listed in this Section 30.4. Nevertheless, all such uses shall
comply with Section 30.3 of this Article and all other applicable ordinances.
b.) Each applicant for administrative approval shall apply to the Director of
Planning & Economic Development, providing the information set forth in
Sections 30.5.2 and 30.5.3 of this Article.
c.) The Planning & Economic Development Department shall respond to each
such application within thirty (30) days after receiving it, providing that the
application contains all information necessary for processing, by either
approving, approving with conditions, denying the application or requesting
additional information. If the Planning & Economic Development Department
fails to respond to the applicant within said thirty (30) days, or such additional
time as is reasonably necessary to obtain the additional information from the
applicant and review it, then the application shall be deemed to be denied.
d.) If an administrative approval is denied, the applicant may appeal said denial
in accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance concerning
appeals of administrative decisions.
e.) The Director of Planning & Economic Development may refer an application
for administrative approval that otherwise meets the standards contained
herein to be considered and approved as required by Section 30.5 if the
Director of Planning & Economic Development determines in writing that the
public interest would be furthered by requiring a Special Use Permit to
construct the Facility in question.

30.4.2 Specific Administratively Approved Uses. The following uses shall be approved
by the Planning & Economic Development Department after conducting an
178
administrative review unless the Director of Planning & Economic Development
concludes that the public interest would be furthered by requiring a special use permit in
conformance with Section 30.4.1(e) of this Article.

the applicant establishes:
a. No other site or current technology could be used to provide intended
services to the residents of the City; and
b. A denial of a permit for the proposed site would create a gap in providing
intended services to the residents of the City.
c. If one or more of the foregoing factors do not exist the Director of Planning
& Economic Development shall inform the applicant that it may request a
Special Use Permit in conformance with Section 30.5 of this Article.
b) Above Ground Service Facilities installed within the side or front yard in any
nonresidential district, the R-7 and R-6 districts, and in any residential zoning lot

30.6 Special Use Permits.
1. General.
The following provisions shall govern the issuance of special use permits.
a.) Above Ground Service Facilities not permitted to be approved
administratively pursuant to Section 30.4 of this Article and not otherwise
prohibited by Section 30.5 of this Article, shall require a special use
permit. Special use applications for Above Ground Service Facilitates shall
be processed and heard in conformance with the requirements of the
Zoning Ordinance.
b.) Where located in a front yard the special use permit shall require that the
Above Ground Service Facility be no closer than five feet (5') inside a front
lot line or five feet (5') inside a side yard lot line abutting a street, or such
greater distance as determined by the City Council.

variety of plant materials that effectively screens the view of the Above
Ground Service Facility from adjacent property and public right-of-way on
a year round basis in accordance with the design criteria set forth in
Article 6.4 of this Ordinance. In some cases, such as an Above Ground
Service Facility sited on a large, wooded lot, natural growth around the
property perimeter may be a sufficient buffer.
b.) In locations where the visual impact of the Above Ground Service Facility
would be and is likely to remain minimal for the foreseeable future, the
landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived by the Director of
Planning & Economic Development.
c.) Provisions of Section 6.11, Tree Preservation of the City Zoning
Ordinance shall apply.
