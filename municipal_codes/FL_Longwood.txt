PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Longwood, Florida. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1982 Code, as supplemented through June 21, 2004, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1982 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Alyce A. Whitson, Senior Code Attorney, Vicki L. Ward, Technical Editor, and William B. Eddy, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Sarah Mijares, City Clerk, Geraldine Zambri, former City Clerk and Richard Taylor, City Attorney and other members of the city staff, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

An order imposing fine that is issued without a hearing shall provide that the violator may request a hearing on the issue of compliance and the amount of the fine pursuant to the procedures set forth in section 2-336 of this division.

b.  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; and 
c.  Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
(c)  A certified copy of an order imposing a fine may be recorded in the public records and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator. Upon petition to the circuit court such order may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including levy against the personal property, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed pursuant to this part shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered in a suit to foreclose on a lien filed pursuant to this section, whichever occurs first. A lien arising from a fine imposed pursuant to this section runs in favor of the City of Longwood and the local city commission may execute a satisfaction or release of lien entered pursuant to this section. After three months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the special magistrate may authorize the city attorney to foreclose on the lien. No lien created pursuant to the provisions of this part may be foreclosed on real property which is a homestead under Section 4, Art. X of the State Constitution. 
(d)  Duration of lien. No lien provided by local codes and ordinances shall continue for a period longer than 20 years after the certified copy of an order imposing a fine has been recorded, unless within that time an action to foreclose on the lien is commenced in a court of competent jurisdiction. In an action to foreclose on a lien, the prevailing party is entitled to recover all costs including a reasonable attorney's fee that it incurs in the foreclosure. The city shall be entitled to collect all costs incurred in recording and satisfying a valid lien. The continuation of the lien affected by the commencement of the action shall not be good against creditors of subsequent purchasers of valuable consideration without notice unless a notice of lis pendens is recorded.

The appeal provided for herein shall be filed within 30 days of the order to be appealed. The nature of the appeal shall be from a final administrative order.

ARTICLE VIII. - IDENTITY THEFT DETECTION PROGRAM 
 
Sec. 2-451. - Purpose. 
(a)  Fulfilling requirements of the red flags rule. Under the red flag rule, every financial institution and creditor is required to establish an "identity theft prevention program" tailored to its size, complexity and the nature of its operation. Each program must contain reasonable policies and procedures to; 
(1)  Identify relevant red flags for new and existing covered accounts and incorporate those red flags into the program; 
(2)  Detect red flags that have been incorporated into the program; 
(3)  Respond appropriately to any red flags that are detected to prevent and mitigate identity theft; and 
(4)  Ensure the program is updated periodically, to reflect changes in risks to customers or to the safety and soundness of the creditor from identity theft. 
(b)  Red flags rule definitions used in this program. The red flags rule defines "identity theft" as "fraud committed using the identifying information of another person" and a "red flag" as a pattern, practice, or specific activity that indicates the possible existence of identity theft. 
According to the rule, a municipal utility is a creditor subject to the rule requirements. The rule defines creditors "to include finance companies, automobile dealers, mortgage brokers, utility companies, and telecommunications companies. Where non-profit and government entities defer payment for goods or services, they, too, are to be considered creditors." 
All the city's accounts that are individual utility service accounts held by customers of the utility whether residential, commercial or industrial are covered by the rule. Under the rule, a "covered account" is: 
(1)  Any account the city offers or maintains primarily for personal, family or household purposes, that involves multiple payments or transactions; and 
(2)  Any other account the city offers or maintains for which there is a reasonably foreseeable risk to customers or to the safety and soundness of the city from identity theft. 
"Identifying information" is defined under the rule as "any name or number that may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific person," including: name, address, telephone number, social security number, date of birth, government issued driver's license or identification number, alien registration number, government passport number, employer or taxpayer identification number, unique electronic identification number, computer's Internet Protocol address, or routing code. 
(Res. No. 09-1214, § 1, 5-18-2009)  
Sec. 2-452. - Identification of red flags. 
In order to identify relevant red flags, the city considers the types of accounts that it offers and maintains, the methods it provides to open its accounts, the methods it provides to access its accounts, and its previous experiences with identity theft. The city identifies the following red flags, in each of the listed categories: 
(a)  Suspicious documents—Red flags. 
(1)  Identification document or card that appears to be forged, altered or inauthentic; 
(2)  Identification document or card on which a person's photograph or physical description is not consistent with the person presenting the document; 
(3)  Other document with information that is not consistent with existing customer information (such as if a person's signature on a check appears forged); and 
(5)  Application for service that appears to have been altered or forged. 
(b)  Suspicious personal identifying information—Red flags. 
(1)  Identifying information presented that is inconsistent with other information the customer provides (example: inconsistent birth dates); 
(2)  Identifying information presented that is inconsistent with other sources of information (for instance, an address not matching an address on a credit report); 
(3)  Identifying information presented that is the same as information shown on other applications that were found to be fraudulent; 
(4)  Identifying information presented that is consistent with fraudulent activity (such as an invalid phone number or fictitious billing address); 
(5)  Driver's license number presented that is the same as one given by another customer; 
(6)  An address or phone number presented that is the same as that of another person; 
(7)  A person fails to provide complete personal identifying information on an application when reminded to do so (however, by law social security numbers must not be required); and 
(8)  A person's identifying information is not consistent with the information that is on file for the customer. 
(c)  Suspicious account activity or unusual use of account—Red flags. 
(1)  Change of address for an account followed by a request to change the account holder's name; 
(2)  Payments stop on an otherwise consistently up-to-date account; 
(3)  Account used in a way that is not consistent with prior use (example; very high activity); 
(4)  Mail sent to the account holder is repeatedly returned as undeliverable; 
(5)  Notice to the city that a customer is not receiving mail sent by the city; 
(6)  Notice to the city that an account has unauthorized activity; 
(7)  Breach in the city's computer system security; and 
(8)  Unauthorized access to or use of customer account information. 
(d)  Alerts from others—Red flags. 
(1)  Notice to the city from a customer, identity theft victim, law enforcement or other person that it has opened or is maintaining a fraudulent account for a person engaged in identity theft. 
(Res. No. 09-1214, § 1, 5-18-2009)  
Sec. 2-453. - Detecting red flags. 
(a)  New accounts. In order to detect any of the red flags identified above associated with the opening of a new account, city personnel will take the following steps to obtain and verify the identity of the person opening the account: 
(1)  Require certain identifying information such as name, date of birth, residential or business address, principal place of business for an entity, driver's license or other identification; 
(2)  Verify the customer's identity (for instance, review a driver's license or other identification card); 
(3)  Review documentation showing the existence of a business entity; and 
(4)  Independently contact the customer. 
(b)  Existing accounts. 
(1)  Verify the identification of customers if they request information (in person, via telephone, via facsimile, via email); 
(2)  Verify the validity of requests to change billing addresses; and 
(3)  Verify changes in banking information given for billing and payment purposes. 
(Res. No. 09-1214, § 1, 5-18-2009)  
Sec. 2-454. - Preventing and mitigating identity theft. 
In the event city personnel detect any identified red flags, such personnel shall take one or more of the following steps, depending on the degree of risk posed by the red flag: 
(a)  Prevent and mitigate. 
(1)  Continue to monitor an account for evidence of identity theft; 
(2)  Contact the customer; 
(3)  Change any passwords or other security devices that permit access to accounts; 
(4)  Not open a new account; 
(5)  Close an existing account; 
(6)  Reopen an account with a new number; 
(7)  Notify a supervisor for determination of the appropriate step(s) to take; 
(8)  Notify law enforcement; or 
(9)  Determine that no response is warranted under the particular circumstances. 
(b)  Protect customer identifying information. In order to further prevent the likelihood of identity theft occurring with respect to city accounts, the city will take the following steps with respect to its internal operating procedures to protect customer identifying information: 
(1)  Ensure that its website is secure or provide clear notice that the website is not secure; 
(2)  Ensure complete and secure destruction of paper documents and computer files containing customer information within the state prescribed guidelines; 
(3)  Ensure that office computers are password protected; 
(4)  Keep offices clear of papers containing customer information; 
(5)  Ensure computer virus protection is up to date; and 
(6)  Require and keep only the kinds of customer information that are necessary for utility purposes. 
(Res. No. 09-1214, § 1, 5-18-2009)  
Sec. 2-455. - Updates. 
This program will be periodically reviewed and updated to reflect changes in risks to customers and the soundness of the utility from identity theft. Periodically management will consider the utility's experiences with identity theft situations, changes in identity theft methods, changes in identity theft detection and prevention methods, changes in types of accounts the utility maintains and changes in the utility's business arrangements with other entities. After considering these factors, a determination will be made as to whether changes to the program, including the listing of red flags, are warranted. If warranted, the city manager will make a determination of whether to accept, modify or reject those changes to the program. 
(Res. No. 09-1214, § 1, 5-18-2009)  
Sec. 2-456. - Administration. 
(a)  Oversight. Responsibility for developing, implementing and updating and administering this policy lies with the financial services director for reviewing any staff reports regarding the detection of red flags and the steps for preventing and mitigating identity theft, determining which steps of prevention and mitigation should be taken in particular circumstances and considering periodic changes to the policy. 
(b)  Service provider arrangements. In the event the city engages a service provider to perform an activity in connection with one or more accounts, the city will take the following steps to ensure the service provider performs its activity in accordance with reasonable policies and procedures designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate the risk of identity theft. 
(1)  Require, by contract, that service providers have such policies and procedures in place; and 
(2)  Require, by contract, that service providers review the city's program and report any red flags to a designated city representative. 
(c)  Specific program elements and confidentiality. For the effectiveness of identity theft prevention programs, the red flag rule envisions a degree of confidentiality regarding the city's specific practices relating to identity theft detection, prevention and mitigation. Therefore, under this program, knowledge of such specific practices will be limited to those employees who need to know them for purposes of preventing identity theft. Because this program is to be adopted by a public body and thus publicly available, it would be counterproductive to list these specific practices here. Therefore, only the program's general red flag detection, implementation and prevention practices are listed in this document. 
(d)  Victim record request. under the FACTAct, identity theft victims are entitled to a copy of the application or other business transaction records relating to their identity theft free of charge. The city must provide these records within 30 days or sooner of receipt of the victim's request. The city must also provide these records to any law enforcement agency which the victim authorizes. 
Before providing the records to the victim, the city must ask the victims for: 
(1)  Proof of identity, which may be a government-issued ID card, the same type of information the identity thief used to open or access the account, or the type of information the business is currently requesting from applicants or customers; and 
(2)  A police report and a completed affidavit, which may be either the FTC identity theft affidavit or the business's own affidavit. 
(e)  IT security. The financial services director will request the information technology manager conduct periodic audits on system user access to privacy related information to ensure only those requiring access are authorized. IT professionals shall agree not to disclose private information, 
(f)  Medical confidentiality. The city shall not obtain or use medical information pertaining to a consumer in connection with any determination of the consumer's eligibility, or continued eligibility, for services. 
(g)  Reports, reviews and updates for policy enforcement. Periodically, internal staff and auditors who report to the city manager, external auditors and accountants, and government regulators will review practices to ensure compliance with corporate policy. The reports will be used to evaluate effectiveness of and amend the identity theft prevention program. 
An annual report reviewing all incidents, program revisions and goals will be submitted to the city manager.

(Code 1982, § 3.5-18)  
Sec. 10-34. - Findings of fact. 
Based upon evidence and testimony presented at public hearings before the city commissioners and on the findings incorporated in the United States Attorney General's Commission on Pornography (1986), Jacksonville Ordinance Code Chapter 410, Ord. 77-257-256, Section 1, the Los Angeles Municipal Code, Section 12.70, Ord. 156509 (1982), the Detroit Zoning Ordinance, 66,0000, Ord. 742-G, Section 1, 10-24-72, and "A Summary of a National Survey of Real Estate Appraisers Regarding the Effect of Adult Bookstores on Property Values", conducted by the Division of Planning Department of Metropolitan Development, Indianapolis, January 1984, and the findings of fact set out in Section 3-5 of the Adult Entertainment Code of Orange County, Florida, a county in Central Florida, and evidence and affidavits presented by the Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation of the Ninth Judicial Circuit of Florida, the city commission hereby finds: 
(1)  Commercial establishments exist or may exist within the city and other nearby cities or counties in Central Florida where books, magazines, periodicals or other printed material, or photographs, films, motion pictures, prints, videotapes, slides, or other visual representations or recordings or other audio matter, or instruments, novelties, devices or paraphernalia which depict, illustrate, describe or relate to specified sexual activities or specified anatomical areas are possessed, displayed, exhibited, distributed and/or sold. 
(2)  Commercial establishments exist or may exist within the city and other nearby cities or counties in Central Florida where dancers, entertainers, performers, or other individuals, who, for commercial gain, perform or are presented while displaying or exposing specified anatomical areas; or engage in straddle dancing or touching with customers. 
(3)  The activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section occur at establishments which operate for the purpose of making a profit and, as such, are subject to regulation by the city in the interest of the health, safety, economy, property values, and general welfare of the people, businesses, and industries of the city. 
(4)  When the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section are present in establishments, other activities which are illegal, unsafe, or unhealthful tend to accompany them, concentrate around them, and be aggravated by them. Such other activities include, but are not limited to, prostitution, pandering, solicitation for prostitution, lewd and lascivious behavior, exposing minors to harmful materials, possession, distribution and transportation of obscene materials, sale or possession of controlled substances, and violent crimes against persons and property. 
(5)  When the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section are competitively exploited in establishments, they tend to attract an undesirable number of transients, blight neighborhoods, adversely affect neighboring businesses, lower real property values, promote the particular crimes described in subsection (4) of this section, and ultimately lead residents and businesses to move to other locations. 
(6)  The establishments in which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section occur often are constructed, in part or in whole of substandard materials, maintained in a manner reflecting disregard for the health and safety of the occupants, and have exterior signs or appearance that lower the surrounding property values and contribute to urban decline. 
(7)  The activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section often occur in establishments concurrent with the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages. 
(8)  The concurrence of the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages with the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section leads to an increase in criminal activity, unsafe activity, and disturbances of the peace and order of the surrounding community. 
(9)  The concurrence of the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages with the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section creates additional hazards to the health and safety of persons in attendance and further depreciates the value of adjoining real property harming the economic welfare of the surrounding community and adversely affecting the quality of life, tone of commerce, and community environment. 
(10)  In order to preserve and safeguard the health, safety, property values, and general welfare of the people, businesses, and industries of the city it is necessary and advisable for the city to prohibit the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages at establishments where the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, occur. 
(11)  Aforementioned studies show that employees of establishments at which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section occur engage in a higher incidence of certain types of unhealthy or criminal behavior than employees of other establishments. 
(12)  Physical contact or touching within establishments at which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section occur between employees exhibiting specified anatomical areas and customers poses a threat to the health of both and promotes the spread of communicable and social diseases. 
(13)  In order to preserve and safeguard the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city, it is necessary and advisable for the city to regulate the conduct of owners, managers, operators, agents, employees, entertainers, performers, and customers at establishments where the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section occur. 
(14)  The potential dangers to the health, safety and general welfare of the people of the city posed by permitting an establishment at which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section occur to operate without first meeting the requirements for obtaining a license under this code are so great as to require the licensure of such establishments prior to their being permitted to operate. 
(15)  Requiring operators of establishments at which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section occur to keep a list of information concerning current employees, including their name, current address, mailing address, social security number, date of birth, drivers license number and criminal convictions, and certain recent past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects, and by preventing minors from working in such establishments. 
(16)  Prohibiting establishments at which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section occur from operating within set distances of educational institutions, day care centers, religious institutions, residences, areas zoned or designated for residential use, and parks, at which minors are customarily found, will serve to protect minors from the adverse affects of the activities that accompany such establishments. 
(17)  Straddle dancing, unregulated private performances, and enclosed adult booths in establishments at which the activities described in subsections (1) and (2) of this section occur have resulted in indiscriminate commercial sex between strangers and poses a threat to the health of the participants and promotes the spread of communicable sexually transmitted diseases.

ARTICLE V. - PROPER USE OF FERTILIZERS 
 
Sec. 38-150. - Findings. 
As a result of impairment to surface waters caused by excessive nutrients, and as a result of increasing levels of nitrogen in the surface and ground water within the aquifers and springs, the city hereby determines that the use of fertilizers creates a risk to contributing to adverse effects on surface and ground water. Accordingly, the city commission hereby finds that management measures contained in the most recent edition of the "Florida-Friendly Best Management Practices for Protection of Water Resources by the Green Industries" are required. 
(Ord. No. 17-2122 , § 2, 9-6-2017)  
Sec. 38-151. - Purpose and intent. 
This article: (a) regulates the proper use of fertilizers by any applicator; (b) requires proper training of commercial and institutional fertilizer applicators; (c) establishes training and licensing requirements; (d) establishes a prohibited application period; and (e) specifies allowable fertilizer application rates and methods, fertilizer free zones, low maintenance zones, and exemptions. This article requires the use of best management practices, which provide specific management guidelines to minimize negative secondary and cumulative environmental effects associated with the misuse of fertilizers. These secondary and cumulative effects have been observed in and on natural and constructed stormwater conveyances, rivers, creeks, canals, springs, lakes, and other water bodies. Collectively, these water bodies are an asset critical to the environmental, recreational, cultural, and economic well-being of city residents and the health of the public in general. Overgrowth of algae and vegetation hinder the effectiveness of flood attenuation provided by natural and constructed stormwater conveyances. Regulation of nutrients, including both nitrogen and phosphorus contained in fertilizer, will help improve and maintain water and habitat quality.

Sec. 74-6. - Stormwater utility fees. 
(a)  Schedule of stormwater utility fees. The stormwater management utility is empowered by this article to recommend charges for the use and discharge to the city's stormwater management system. Such charges shall be based on the cost within the city of providing stormwater management services to all properties receiving different classes of service. The city commission shall adopt and revise, from time to time, a schedule of stormwater utility fees for stormwater management services to cover funding requirements of utility operations. 
(b)  Rates for stormwater management service. There is levied against all feepayers for all real property in the city which contributes stormwater management system a monthly stormwater utility fee in accordance with the following definitions, methodology, and schedule: 
(1)  Stormwater utility fees. Stormwater utility fees shall be as set out in appendix B for the following categories: 
a.  Single family property stormwater utility fee, per month per unit. 
b.  Multifamily property stormwater utility fee, per month per unit. 
c.  Nonresidential/commercial property stormwater utility fee: 
Per EDU per month (if property has mitigation). 
Minimum charge per month. 
Per EDU month (if property has no mitigation). 
Minimum charge per month. 
d.  Vacant property will be assessed a stormwater utility fee, as follows: 
1.  Vacant residential platted property. 
2.  All other vacant property. 
The stormwater utility fees shall become effective upon passage. 
(2)  Stormwater management systems inspection fee. The city shall charge a fee as set out in appendix B for each inspection of completed stormwater management systems which were approved for construction by the city. 
(3)  Billing of stormwater utility and stormwater management systems inspection fees. Stormwater utility fees and stormwater management system inspection fees imposed by this article shall be billed in conjunction with the monthly utility bill (for nonvacant properties) issued by the city's utility billing section. Such fees shall be due and payable at the same time and in the same manner and subject to the same penalties as other utility fees. 
Stormwater utility fees for vacant property shall be billed separately, semi-annually, on September 1 and March 1. 
Any charge due hereunder which is not paid when due shall bear all approved monthly service charges as provided for elsewhere by ordinance and may be recovered in an action at law by the city. The feepayer shall be responsible for all costs of collection to include reasonable attorney's fees, whether or not the suit is necessary. In addition to any other remedies or penalties provided by this ordinance of the city, failure of any user of city utilities within the city to pay said charges promptly when due shall subject such user to discontinuance of utility service and the city manager is hereby empowered and directed to enforce this provision as to any and all delinquent users. 
The utility fee and inspection fee hereinabove prescribed shall constitute a debt to the city for which the owner, tenant, and/or occupant shall be jointly and severally liable. The records of the city shall be kept open for inspection by the owner, tenant, and occupant and it shall be the responsibility of an owner, tenant, and occupant to ascertain that the prescribed fee or fees are being paid. 
(c)  Delinquent charges; liens. The city shall have a lien upon the property for which the stormwater utility fee is assessed for any and all delinquent or unpaid stormwater management utility fees. Enforcement and foreclosure of said lien(s) shall be as provided by law. The city shall be entitled to collect reasonable attorney's fees from any feepayer, customer or property owner for services rendered by the city's attorney in the collection of such charges or in the institution and prosecution of any foreclosure proceedings. 
(d)  Stormwater utility fee appeal process. Any feepayer who feels that the stormwater utility fee for his property has been assigned or computed incorrectly may petition in writing to the city manager, or the city manager's designee, for review of said charges. If the property and its use is not specified on the applicable fee schedule, the city manager shall use the fee applicable to the most nearly comparable type of land use on the fee schedule. If the feepayer questions the computation of the stormwater utility fee, then the feepayer shall prepare and submit to the city manager, or designee, an independent fee calculation for the property. The independent fee calculation study shall follow the prescribed methodologies and formats established by this article and any regulations promulgated hereunder. Independent fee calculations studies shall be prepared and presented by professionals qualified in their respective fields. The study shall show the basis upon which the independent fee calculation was made, including but not limited to surveys, showing the impervious areas, onsite stormwater retention and stormwater detention areas and internal on-site stormwater management systems, and engineering studies documenting stormwater runoff and proposed credits attributable to the property. The city manager or designee shall consider the documentation submitted by the feepayer but is not required to accept such documentation which he shall reasonably deem to be inaccurate, inapplicable, or not reliable and may, in the alternative, require the feepayer to submit additional or different documentation for consideration. If any acceptable independent fee calculation study is not presented, the feepayer shall pay the stormwater utility fees based upon the schedules set forth in this article. 
(1)  If the feepayer is not satisfied with the determination by the city manager or designee, the feepayer, by filing a written request with the city manager within ten calendar days of the city manager's determination, may request to be heard by the city commission. 
(2)  Any adjustment to the originally determined area shall be retroactive to commencement of the charges and fees.

Sec. 78-31. - Title. 
This article shall be known and may be cited as the Longwood Communications Rights-of-Way Ordinance. 
(Code 1982, § 19-21)  
Sec. 78-32. - Intent and purpose. 
It is the intent of the city to promote the public health, safety and general welfare by: providing for the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way within the city; adopting and administering reasonable rules and regulations not inconsistent with state and federal law, including F.S. § 337.401, as it may be amended, the city's home rule authority, and in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 and other federal and state law; establishing reasonable rules and regulations necessary to manage the placement or maintenance of communications facilities in the public rights-of-way by all communications services providers; and minimizing disruption to the public rights-of-way. In regulating its public rights-of-way, the city shall be governed by and shall comply with all applicable federal and state laws. 
(Code 1982, § 19-22)  
Sec. 78-33. - Definitions. 
For purposes of this article, the following terms, phrases, words and their derivations shall have the meanings given. Where not inconsistent with the context, the words "shall" and "will" are mandatory, and "may" is permissive. Words not otherwise defined shall be construed to mean the common and ordinary meaning: 
Abandonment means the permanent cessation of all uses of a communications facility; provided that this term shall not include cessation of all use of a facility within a physical structure where the physical structure continues to be used. By way of example, and not limitation, cessation of all use of a cable within a conduit, where the conduit continues to be used, shall not be "abandonment" of a facility in public rights-of-way. 
Communications facility or facility or system means any permanent or temporary plant, equipment and property, including but not limited to cables, wires, conduits, ducts, fiber optics, poles, antennae, converters, splice boxes, cabinets, hand holes, manholes, vaults, drains, surface location markers, appurtenances, and other equipment or pathway placed or maintained or to be placed or maintained in the public rights-of-way of the City of Longwood and used or capable of being used to transmit, convey, route, receive, distribute, provide or offer communications services. 
Communications services means the transmission, conveyance or routing of voice, data, audio, video, or any other information or signals to a point, or between or among points, by or through any electronic, radio, satellite, cable, optical, microwave, or other medium or method now in existence or hereafter devised, regardless of the protocol used for such transmission or conveyance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for purposes of this article "cable service," as defined in F.S. § 202.11(2), is not included in the definition of "communications services," and cable service providers may be subject to other ordinances of the city. 
Communications services provider means any person including a municipality or county providing communications services through the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way. "Communications services provider" shall also include any person including a municipality or county that places or maintains a communications facility in public rights-of-way but does not provide communications services. 
FCC means the Federal Communications Commission. 
In public rights-of-way or in the public rights-of-way means in, on, over, under or across the public rights-of-way. 
Person shall include any individual, children, firm, association, joint venture, partnership, estate, trust, business trust, syndicate, fiduciary, corporation, organization or legal entity of any kind, successor, assignee, transferee, personal representative, and all other groups or combinations, and shall include the city to the extent the city acts as a communications services provider. 
Place or maintain or placement or maintenance or placing or maintaining means to erect, construct, install, maintain, place, repair, extend, expand, remove, occupy, locate or relocate. A communications services provider that owns or exercises physical control over communications facilities in public rights-of-way, such as the physical control to maintain and repair, is "placing or maintaining" the facilities. A person providing service only through resale or only through use of a third party's unbundled network elements is not "placing or maintaining" the communications facilities through which such service is provided. The transmission and receipt of radio frequency signals through the airspace of the public rights-of-way does not constitute "placing or maintaining" facilities in the public rights-of-way. 
Public rights-of-way means a public right-of-way, public utility easement, highway, street, bridge, tunnel or alley for which the city is the authority that has jurisdiction and control and may lawfully grant access to pursuant to applicable law, and includes the surface, the air space over the surface and the area below the surface. "Public rights-of-way" shall not include private property. "Public rights-of-way" shall not include any real or personal city property except as described above and shall not include city buildings, fixtures, poles, conduits, facilities or other structures or improvements, regardless of whether they are situated in the public rights-of-way. 
Registrant means a communications services provider that has registered with the city in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
Registration or register means the process described in this article whereby a communications services provider provides certain information to the city.

The city shall so reply to an applicant within 30 days after receipt of registration information from the applicant. Noneffectiveness of registration shall not preclude an applicant from filing subsequent applications for registration under the provisions of this section. An applicant has 30 days after receipt of a notice of noneffectiveness of registration to appeal the decision as provided in section 78-38. 
(e)  A registrant may cancel a registration upon written notice to the city stating that it will no longer place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way within the city and will no longer need to obtain permits to perform work in public rights-of-way. A registrant cannot cancel a registration if the registrant continues to place or maintain any communications facilities in public rights-of-way. 
(f)  Registration does not in and of itself establish a right to place or maintain or priority for the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way within the city but shall establish for the registrant a right to apply for a permit, if permitting is required by the city. Registrations are expressly subject to any future amendment to or replacement of this article and further subject to any additional city ordinances, as well as any state or federal laws that may be enacted. 
(g)  A registrant shall renew its registration with the city by April 1 of even numbered years in accordance with the registration requirements in this article, except that a registrant that initially registers during the even numbered year when renewal would be due or the odd numbered year immediately preceding such even numbered year shall not be required to renew until the next even numbered year. Within 30 days of any change in the information required to be submitted pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, a registrant shall provide updated information to the city. If no information in the then-existing registration has changed, the renewal may state that no information has changed. Failure to renew a registration may result in the city restricting the issuance of additional permits until the communications services provider has complied with the registration requirements of this article. 
(h)  In accordance with applicable city ordinances, codes or regulations, a permit may be required of a communications services provider that desires to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way. An effective registration shall be a condition of obtaining a permit. Notwithstanding an effective registration, permitting requirements shall apply. A permit may be obtained by or on behalf of a registrant having an effective registration if all permitting requirements are met. 
(Code 1982, § 19-24)  
Sec. 78-35. - Notice of transfer, sale or assignment of assets in public rights-of-way. 
If a registrant transfers, sells or assigns its assets located in public rights-of-way incident to a transfer, sale or assignment of the registrant's assets, the transferee, buyer or assignee shall be obligated to comply with the terms of this article. Written notice of any such transfer, sale or assignment shall be provided by such registrant to the city within 20 days after the effective date of the transfer, sale or assignment. If the transferee, buyer or assignee is a current registrant, then the transferee, buyer or assignee is not required to re-register. If the transferee, buyer or assignee is not a current registrant, then the transferee, buyer or assignee shall register as provided in section 78-34 within 60 days of the transfer, sale or assignment. If permit applications are pending in the registrant's name, the transferee, buyer or assignee shall notify the city that the transferee, buyer or assignee is the new applicant. 
(Code 1982, § 19-25)  
Sec. 78-36. - Placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way. 
(a)  A registrant shall at all times comply with and abide by all applicable provisions of the state and federal law and city ordinances, codes and regulations in placing or maintaining a communications facility in public rights-of-way. 
(b)  A registrant shall not commence to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way until all applicable permits, if any, have been issued by the city or other appropriate authority, except in the case of an emergency. The term "emergency" shall mean a condition that affects the public's health, safety or welfare, which includes an unplanned out-of-service condition of a preexisting service. Registrant shall provide prompt notice to the city of the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way in the event of an emergency and shall be required to obtain an after-the-fact permit if a permit would have originally been required to perform the work undertaken in public rights-of-way in connection with the emergency. Registrant acknowledges that as a condition of granting such permits, the city may impose reasonable rules or regulations governing the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way. Permits shall apply only to the areas of public rights-of-way specifically identified in the permit. 
(c)  Upon receipt of written notification from the city of the effectiveness of registration, a registrant may apply for a permit. Permit application may be made by mail or in person at: 
City of Longwood Public Works

(d)  To the extent not otherwise prohibited by state or federal law, the city shall have the power to prohibit or limit the placement of new or additional communications facilities within a particular area of public rights-of-way. 
(e)  All communications facilities shall be placed or maintained so as not to unreasonably interfere with the use of the public rights-of-way by the public and with the rights and convenience of property owners who adjoin any of the public rights-of-way. The use of trenchless technology (i.e., directional bore method) for the installation of facilities in the public rights-of-way as well as joint trenching or the collocation of facilities in existing conduit is strongly encouraged, and should be employed wherever feasible. The city manager or designee may promulgate reasonable rules and regulations concerning the placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way consistent with this article and other applicable law.

(g)  After the completion of any placement or maintenance of a communications facility in public rights-of-way or each phase thereof, a registrant shall, at its own expense, restore the public rights-of-way to its original condition before such work. If the registrant fails to make such restoration within 30 days, or such longer period of time as may be reasonably required under the circumstances, following the completion of such placement or maintenance, the city may perform restoration and charge the costs of the restoration against the registrant in accordance with F.S. § 337.402. For 12 months following the original completion of the work, the registrant shall guarantee its restoration work and shall correct any restoration work that does not satisfy the requirements of this article at its own expense. 
(h)  Removal or relocation at the direction of the city of a registrant's communications facility in public rights-of-way shall be governed by the provisions of F.S. §§ 337.403 and 337.404. 
(i)  A permit from the city constitutes authorization to undertake only certain activities in public rights-of-way in accordance with this article, and does not create a property right or grant authority to impinge upon the rights of others who may have an interest in the public rights-of-way. 
(j)  A Registrant shall maintain its communications facility in public rights-of-way in a manner consistent with accepted industry practice and applicable law. 
(k)  In connection with excavation in the public rights-of-way, a registrant shall, where applicable, comply with the Underground Facility Damage Prevention and Safety Act set forth in F.S. ch. 556. 
(l)  Registrant shall use and exercise due caution, care and skill in performing work in the public rights-of-way and shall take all reasonable steps to safeguard work site areas. 
(m)  Upon request of the city, and as notified by the city of the other work, construction, installation or repairs referenced below, a registrant may be required to coordinate placement or maintenance activities under a permit with any other work, construction, installation or repairs that may be occurring or scheduled to occur within a reasonable timeframe in the subject public rights-of-way, and registrant may be required to reasonably alter its placement or maintenance schedule as necessary so as to minimize disruptions and disturbance in the public rights-of-way. 
(n)  A registrant shall not place or maintain its communications facilities so as to interfere with, displace, damage or destroy any facilities, including but not limited to, sewers, gas or water mains, storm drains, pipes, cables or conduits of the city or any other person's facilities lawfully occupying the public rights-of-way of the city. 
(o)  The city makes no warranties or representations regarding the fitness, suitability, or availability of its public rights-of-way for the registrant's communications facilities and any performance of work, costs incurred or services provided by registrant shall be at registrant's sole risk. Nothing in this article shall affect the city's authority to add, vacate or abandon public rights-of-way, and the city makes no warranties or representations regarding the availability of any added, vacated or abandoned public rights-of-way for communications facilities. 
(p)  The city shall have the right to make such inspections of communications facilities placed or maintained in public rights-of-way as it finds necessary to ensure compliance with this article. 
(q)  A permit application to place a new or replace an existing communications facility in public rights-of-way shall include plans showing the location of the proposed installation of facilities in the public rights-of-way. If the plans so provided require revision based upon actual installation, the registrant shall promptly provide revised plans. The plans shall be in a hard copy format and an electronic format specified by the city, provided such electronic format is maintained by the registrant. Such plans in a format maintained by the registrant shall be provided at no cost to the city. 
(r)  The city reserves the right to place and maintain, and permit to be placed or maintained, sewer, gas, water, electric, storm drainage, communications, and other types of facilities, cables or conduit, and to do, and to permit to be done, any underground and overhead installation or improvement that may be deemed necessary or proper by the city in public rights-of-way occupied by the registrant. The city further reserves without limitation the right to alter, change, or cause to be changed, the grading, installation, relocation, or width of the public rights-of-way within the limits of the city and within said limits as same may from time to time be altered. 
(s)  A registrant shall, on the request of any person holding a permit issued by the city, temporarily raise or lower its communications facilities to permit the work authorized by the permit.

The registrant shall be given not less than 30 days advance written notice to arrange for such temporary relocation. 
(Code 1982, § 19-26)  
Sec. 78-37. - Suspension of permits. 
(a)  The city may suspend a permit for work in the public rights-of-way for one or more of the following reasons: 
(1)  Violation of permit conditions, including conditions set forth in the permit, this article or other applicable city ordinances, codes or regulations governing placement or maintenance of communications facilities in public rights-of-way; 
(2)  Misrepresentation or fraud by registrant in a registration or permit application to the city; 
(3)  Failure to properly renew or ineffectiveness of registration; or 
(4)  Failure to relocate or remove facilities as may be lawfully required by the city. 
(b)  The city manager or designee shall provide notice and an opportunity to cure any violation of subsections (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, each of which shall be reasonable under the circumstances. 
(Code 1982, § 19-27)  
Sec. 78-38. - Appeals. 
Final, written decisions of the city manager or designee suspending or denying a permit, denying an application for a registration or denying an application for renewal of a registration are subject to appeal. An appeal must be filed with the city manager or designee within 30 days of the date of the final, written decision to be appealed. Any appeal not timely filed as set forth above shall be waived. The city shall consider the appeal within 30 days of the receipt of the appeal, unless waived by the registrant, and a written decision shall be rendered within 20 days. Upon correction of the grounds that gave rise to a suspension or denial, the suspension or denial shall be lifted. 
(Code 1982, § 19-28)  
Sec. 78-39. - Involuntary termination of registration.

(b)  Prior to termination, the registrant shall be notified by the city manager or designee with a written notice setting forth all matters pertinent to the proposed termination action, including which of subsections (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section is applicable as the reason therefor, and describing the proposed action of the city with respect thereto. The registrant shall have 60 days after receipt of such notice within which to address or eliminate the reason or within which to present a plan, satisfactory to the city manager or designee, to accomplish the same. If the plan is rejected, the city manager or designee shall provide written notice of such rejection to the registrant and shall make a recommendation to the city commission regarding a decision as to termination of registration. A decision by the city to terminate a registration may only be accomplished by an action of the city commission. A registrant shall be notified by written notice of any decision by the city commission to terminate its registration. Such written notice shall be sent within seven days after the decision.

If a registrant fails to comply with this subsection, the city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including but not limited to taking possession of the facilities where another person has not assumed the ownership or physical control of the facilities or requiring the registrant within 90 days of the termination, or such longer period as may be agreed to by the registrant, to remove some or all of the facilities from the public rights-of-way and restore the public rights-of-way to its original condition before the removal. 
(d)  In any event, a terminated registrant shall take such steps as are necessary to render safe every portion of the communications facilities remaining in the public rights-of-way of the city.

This provision includes, but is not limited to, the city's reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in defending against any such claim, suit or proceedings. The city agrees to notify the registrant, in writing, within a reasonable time of receiving notice, of any issue it determines may require indemnification. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the city from participating in the defense of any litigation by its own counsel and at its own cost if in the city's reasonable belief there exists or may exist a conflict, potential conflict or appearance of a conflict.

(b)  The indemnification requirements shall survive and be in effect after the termination or cancellation of a registration. 
(Code 1982, § 19-32)  
Sec. 78-43. - Construction bond. 
(a)  Prior to issuing a permit where the work under the permit will require restoration of public rights-of-way, the city may require a construction bond to secure the restoration of the public rights-of-way. The construction bond shall be issued by a surety having a rating reasonably acceptable to the city; shall be subject to the approval of the city attorney; and shall provide that: "For 12 months after issuance of this bond, this bond may not be canceled, or allowed to lapse, until 60 days after receipt by the City of Longwood, by certified mail, return receipt requested, of a written notice from the issuer of the bond of intent to cancel or not to renew." Twelve months after the completion of the restoration in public rights-of-way in accordance with the bond, the registrant may eliminate the bond. However, the city may subsequently require a new bond for any subsequent work in the public rights-of-way. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a construction bond hereunder may only be required to the extent that the cost of the restoration exceeds the amount recoverable against the security fund as provided in section 78-44. 
(b)  The rights reserved by the city with respect to any construction bond established pursuant to this section are in addition to all other rights and remedies the city may have under this article, or at law or equity. 
(c)  The rights reserved to the city under this section are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved in this article, or authorized by other law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to the construction bond will affect any other right the city may have. 
(Code 1982, § 19-33)  
Sec. 78-44. - Security fund. 
At or prior to the time a registrant receives its first permit to place or maintain a communications facility in public rights-of-way after the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, the registrant shall make a cash deposit or file an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of $25,000.00, or shall file a demand bond in the amount of $100,000.00. The bond shall be in a form acceptable to the city attorney. The surety company that issues the demand bond shall be authorized by the state department of insurance to issue such bonds in this state, and shall be listed in the department of treasury's listing of approved sureties Circular 570 effective July 1 annually as amended. The cash deposit, irrevocable letter of credit or demand bond shall be referred to as the "security fund." The security fund shall be conditioned upon the full and faithful compliance with and performance by the communications service provider of all requirements, duties and obligations imposed by the provisions of this article. The security fund shall be maintained from such time through the earlier of: (i) transfer, sale, assignment or removal of all communications facilities in public rights-of-way and the establishment of a security fund by the transferee, purchaser or assignee; or (ii) 12 months after the termination or cancellation of any registration. The security fund shall be furnished annually or as frequently as necessary to provide a continuing guarantee of the registrant's full and faithful performance at all times. In the event a registrant fails to perform its duties and obligations imposed upon the registrant by the provisions of this article, subject to section 78-45, there shall be recoverable, jointly and severally from the principal and holder or surety of the security fund, any damages or loss suffered by the city as a result, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification or cost of removal, relocation or abandonment of any facilities of the registrant in public rights-of-way, plus a reasonable allowance for attorneys' fees, up to the full amount of the security fund. 
(Code 1982, § 19-34)  
Sec. 78-45. - Enforcement remedies. 
(a)  A registrant's failure to comply with provisions of this article shall constitute a violation of this article and shall subject the registrant to payment of damages resulting from said violation. The city manager or designee shall determine the amount of damages, using when practical the estimate of a contractor to determine the damages. The registrant shall be given ten days from the date of receipt of notice of the violation to either cure the violation, pay the amount of damages specified, or appeal the decision of the city manager to the city commission. The appeal shall be placed on the next available agenda of the city commission. A format similar to that used at quasi-judicial hearings shall be used in hearing the appeal. The registrant may appeal the decision of the city commission to the county court or circuit court of the county having jurisdiction of the controversy. At any time after ten days of receipt of the notice of violation and amount of damages the city may recover the amount of damages from the security fund even if the registrant has appealed the determination of the city manager to the city commission or the decision of the city commission to the county court or circuit court. Any issuers of a letter of credit, cash bond or surety bond shall pay the amount of damages within 20 days of receipt of a demand for payment of damages. The fact that the registrant contests the violation or amount of damages before the city commission or county court or circuit court shall not be grounds for nonpayment pursuant to a letter of credit, cash bond or surety bond. The prevailing party in any legal action between the registrant and the city or the city and any issues of a letter of credit, holder of a cash bond or surety bond shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys fees and court costs. 
(b)  Failure of the city to enforce any requirements of this article shall not constitute a waiver of the city's right to enforce that violation or subsequent violations of the same type or to seek appropriate enforcement remedies. 
(Code 1982, § 19-35)  
Sec. 78-46. - Abandonment of a communications facility. 
(a)  Upon abandonment of a communications facility owned by a registrant in public rights-of-way, the registrant shall notify the city within 90 days. 
(b)  The city may direct the registrant by written notice to remove all or any portion of such abandoned facility at the registrant's sole expense if the city determines that the abandoned facility's presence interferes with the public health, safety or welfare, which shall include, but shall not be limited to, a determination that such facility: (i) compromises safety at any time for any public rights-of-way user or during construction or maintenance in public rights-of-way; (ii) prevents another person from locating facilities in the area of public rights-of-way where the abandoned facility is located when other alternative locations are not reasonably available; or (iii) creates a maintenance condition that is disruptive to the public rights-of-way's use. In the event of (ii), the city may require the third person to coordinate with the registrant that owns the existing facility for joint removal and placement, where agreed to by the registrant. 
(c)  In the event that the city does not direct the removal of the abandoned facility, the registrant, by its notice of abandonment to the city shall be deemed to consent to the alteration or removal of all or any portion of the facility by the city or another person at such third party's cost. 
(d)  If the registrant fails to remove all or any portion of an abandoned facility as directed by the city within a reasonable time period as may be required under the circumstances, the city may perform such removal and charge the cost of the removal against the registrant. 
(Code 1982, § 19-36)  
Sec. 78-47. - Force majeure. 
In the event a registrant's performance of or compliance with any of the provisions of this article is prevented by a cause or event not within the registrant's control, such inability to perform or comply shall be deemed excused and no penalties or sanctions shall be imposed as a result, provided, however, that such registrant uses all practicable means to expeditiously cure or correct any such inability to perform or comply. For purposes of this article, causes or events not within a registrant's control shall include, without limitation, acts of God, floods, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, fires and other natural disasters, acts of public enemies, riots or civil disturbances, sabotage, strikes and restraints imposed by order of a governmental agency or court. Causes or events within registrant's control, and thus not falling within this section, shall include, without limitation, registrant's financial inability to perform or comply, economic hardship, and misfeasance, malfeasance or nonfeasance by any of registrant's directors, officers, employees, contractors or agents. 
(Code 1982, § 19-37)  
Sec. 78-48. - Reservation of rights and remedies. 
(a)  The city reserves the right to amend this article as it shall find necessary in the lawful exercise of its police powers. 
(b)  This article shall be applicable to all communications facilities placed in the public rights-of-way on or after the effective date of this article and shall apply to all existing communications facilities in the public rights-of-way prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, to the full extent permitted by state and federal law. 
(c)  The adoption of this article is not intended to affect any rights or defenses of the city or a communications service provider under any existing franchise, license or other agreements with a communications services provider. 
(d)  Nothing in this article shall affect the remedies the city or the registrant has available under applicable law. 
(e)  Any person who uses the communications facilities of a registrant, other than the registrant that owns the facilities, shall not be entitled to any rights to place or maintain such facilities in excess of the rights of the registrant that places or maintains the facilities.

The date of receipt of such taxes by the city will be the date of postmark, or if by electronic transfer, the date received by the city's primary bank as indicated on the city's bank statement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in the event the total amount of tax anticipated to be collected within a calendar quarter does not exceed $120.00, the seller of such service may, with the written authorization of the city, remit the taxes collected during such calendar quarter to the city quarterly.

To assure proper administration of the provisions of this chapter, the city may, where possible and practical, conduct a periodic audit of each sales records of all businesses in connection with which the tax is imposed under this chapter. Failure to conduct such an audit will not eliminate the liability of the seller for collection and remittance of the tax. Pursuant to F.S. § 166.234, the city may, during the seller's normal business hours at the official location of the seller's books and records, audit the records of any seller of a service that is taxable by the city under F.S. § 166.231 or F.S. § 166.232, for the purposes of ascertaining whether taxable services have been provided or the correctness of any return that has been filed or payment that has been made, if the city's power to assess tax or grant a refund is not barred by the applicable limitations period. Each such seller must provide to the city, upon 60 days' written notice of intent to audit from the city, access to applicable records for such service, except an extension of this 60-day period must be granted if reasonably requested by the seller. The seller may at its option waive the 60-day notice requirement. If either the city or the seller requires an additional extension, it must give notice to the other no less than 30 days before the existing extension expires, except in cases of bona fide emergency or waiver of the notice requirement by the other party.

As used in this section, "applicable records" means records kept in the ordinary course of business which establish the collection and remittance of taxes due.

In addition, penalties will be assessed at a rate of five percent per month of the delinquent tax, not to exceed a total penalty of 25 percent, except that in no event will the penalty for failure to file a return be less than $15.00. In the case of a fraudulent return or a willful intent to evade payment of the tax, the seller making such fraudulent return or willfully attempting to evade payment of the tax, shall be liable for a specific penalty of 100 percent of the tax. Interest and penalties shall be computed on the net tax due after application of any overpayments. The interest and penalties shall accrue from the due date until the date such taxes are paid; provided, however, that the city may settle or compromise any interest due pursuant to this section as is reasonable under the circumstances. 
(b)  The city is entitled to and may assess against any seller not complying with any provision of this chapter, a fee based upon the actual costs incurred by the city in collecting the tax or the information due.

(Ord. No. 01-1574, § 2.11, 6-18-2001)  
Sec. 82-162. - Procedural irregularities. 
Any irregularity in the proceedings in connection with the levy of any assessment under the provisions of this article shall not affect the validity of the same after the approval thereof, and any assessment as finally approved shall be competent and sufficient evidence that such assessment was duly levied, that the assessment was duly made and adopted, and that all other proceedings adequate to such assessment were duly had, taken and performed as required by this article; and no variance from the directions hereunder shall be held material unless it be clearly shown that the party objecting was materially injured thereby. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section 82-162, any party objecting to an assessment imposed pursuant to this article must file an objection with a court of competent jurisdiction within the time periods prescribed herein.

(b)  The number of assessment units attributed to a parcel of property may be corrected at any time by the city. Any such correction which reduces an assessment shall be considered valid from the date on which the assessment was imposed and shall in no way affect the enforcement of the assessment imposed under the provisions of this article. Any such correction which increases an assessment or imposes an assessment on omitted property shall first require notice to the affected owner in the manner described in section 82-156 hereof, providing the date, time and place that the city commission will consider confirming the correction and offering the owner an opportunity to be heard. 
(c)  After the assessment roll has been delivered to the tax collector in accordance with the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, any changes, modifications or corrections thereto shall be made in accordance with the procedures applicable to errors and insolvencies for ad valorem taxes.

An assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within 30 days from the due date. The city or its agent shall notify any property owner who is delinquent in payment of an assessment within 60 days from the date such assessment was due. Such notice shall state in effect that the city or its agent will initiate a foreclosure action and cause the foreclosure of such property subject to a delinquent assessment in a method now or hereafter provided by law for foreclosure of mortgages on real estate, or otherwise as provided by law. 
(4)  All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related to any foreclosure action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein. At the sale pursuant to decree in any such action, the city may be the purchaser to the same extent as an individual person or corporation. The city may join in one foreclosure action the collection of assessments against any or all property assessed in accordance with the provisions hereof. All delinquent property owners whose property is foreclosed [upon] shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city and its agents, including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent assessments and any other costs incurred by the city as a result of such delinquent assessments including, but not limited to, costs paid for draws on a credit facility and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, the costs of the action. 
(5)  In lieu of foreclosure, any delinquent assessment and the costs, fees and expenses attributable thereto, may be collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; provided however, that: 
a.  Notice is provided to the owner in the manner required by law and this article; and 
b.  Any existing lien of record on the affected parcel for the delinquent assessment is supplanted by the lien resulting from certification of the assessment roll to the tax collector.

(c)  An assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within 30 days from the due date.

Such notice shall state in effect that the city will initiate a mandamus or other appropriate judicial action to compel payment. 
(d)  All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related to any mandamus or other action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein. All delinquent owners of government property against which a mandamus or other appropriate action is filed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city, including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent assessments and any other costs incurred by the city as a result of such delinquent assessments including, but not limited to, costs paid for draws on a credit facility and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, the costs of the action.

Sec. 86-122. - Issuance, reissuance, transfer, revocation of license; right of appeal. 
(a)  The chief of police or designee may refuse to issue or reissue or transfer the occupational license and/or business tax receipt for a towing service as provided for in this section when the issue, reissue, or transfer of the license would be contrary to public policy or the welfare of the city. 
(b)  Upon the written request of the chief of police or code enforcement, the code enforcement may schedule a hearing and send a copy of the towing service owner or operator and written notice of hearing by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by hand delivery to the owner of the towing service at the last known address. If an attempt to reach the owner by hand delivery or certified mail is unsuccessful, notice of the hearing may be made by publication as provided in F.S. ch. 49, as amended. Notice, whether by certified mail, hand delivery, or publication, must be provided at least three business days prior to the scheduled hearing before the code enforcement board. The code enforcement board shall conduct a public hearing regarding the refusal to issue, reissue, or transfer the occupational license and/or business tax receipt and may receive and consider any evidence, including evidence of general reputation of the towing service operation or person(s) operating such service which is the subject of the hearing. All testimony at the hearing shall be under oath. The code enforcement board shall not be bound by the formal rules of evidence and may consider hearsay testimony; however the code enforcement board shall act to ensure fundamental due process in its hearing process. The towing service owner shall have the opportunity to appear before the code enforcement board, in person and/or through legal counsel, to offer evidence. At the conclusion of the hearing, based on the evidence received, the code enforcement board may find and declare, based upon the preponderance of evidence that the towing service owner or operator(s) have violated the towing ordinance or the applicable sections of F.S. §§ 713.78 and 715.07, and that the violation(s) is contrary to the interest of the public health, safety, or welfare. If the code enforcement board makes one or more of the above findings, the code enforcement board may refuse to issue or reissue or transfer the occupational license and/or business tax receipt of the towing service. The code enforcement board may continue the hearing in order to receive additional evidence, testimony, or for any other reason the code enforcement board deems appropriate before making its decision. If the code enforcement board does not find that the violations have been proven, it shall direct the office of licensing clerk to issue, reissue, or transfer the license. The code enforcement board shall have the power to adopt rules for the administration and conduct of its hearings which are consistent with this section and the rules of procedure adopted for code enforcement proceedings. 
(c)  In each case of such refusal by the city to issue, reissue, or transfer such license, the applicant therefor shall have the right to appeal such refusal to the city commission by filing with the city a notice of appeal within 30 days after such refusal. The city commission, not later than the second regularly scheduled city commission meeting following receipt of the notice of appeal, shall hold a public hearing to determine if such refusal to issue, reissue, or transfer a license under this section is in the public interest. Notice of the hearing shall be given to the license applicant, which notice shall fix a date for the hearing giving the license applicant an opportunity to be heard on the denial of the issue, reissue, or transfer of the license by the city. Such notice shall be given in writing by code enforcement, at least five days before the date of such hearing, unless such notice is waived by the license applicant. The city commission after hearing from the parties, by majority vote, shall either sustain the position of the code enforcement board and deny the requested license or transfer, or order the city to direct the city to issue, reissue, or transfer the license. The city commission shall make its decision based upon whether the code enforcement board had sufficient reliable evidence to sustain the decision. No new evidence may be presented during the appeal. Such issuance, reissuance, or transfer of occupational license and/or business tax receipt approved by the city commission will be made only after payment to the city of the appropriate license or transfer fee. 
(d)  The city commission shall have the right and authority to revoke any occupational license and/or business tax receipt as referred to in this section and issued to any person, whenever it is made to appear that the business method or operation or work to be conducted or carried on by the licensee is being conducted or carried on through unfair, fraudulent, or illegal methods to the detriment or damage of the public health, safety or welfare, or to customers or patrons of such licensee. Unfair or fraudulent methods are defined as including, but shall not be limited to, untrue or misleading advertising of products or services offered. 
(e)  An aggrieved party may appeal a final order to a court of competent jurisdiction in the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit in and for Seminole County, Florida. Such an appeal shall not be a hearing de novo, but shall be limited to appellate review of the record created prior to such appeal. An appeal shall be filed within 30 days of the date of the written order to be appealed.

Sec. 90-31. - Connection required. 
Where the same shall be available, the owner of every lot or parcel of land within the city shall connect, or cause the plumbing of any building or buildings thereon to be connected, with the city public utilities system, and use the facilities of such system. All such connections shall be made in accordance with rules and regulations which shall be adopted from time to time by the city commission, which rules and regulations shall provide for a charge for making any such connections in such reasonable amount as the city commission may fix and determine; provided, however, that this shall not be construed to entitle any person to cross the private property of another to make such connections. All such work, including new construction, repair, replacement, maintenance or upgrading as related to any portion of the city public utilities system, as well as the installation of backflow prevention devices, shall be accomplished in strict accordance with the City of Longwood Manual of Standards for the Design, Construction and Maintenance of Water and Wastewater Systems .

Sec. 90-32. - Mandatory wastewater service connection. 
(a)  The owner of every other lot or parcel of land which abuts an existing or planned street, right-of-way, or other public thoroughfare or public easement containing a wastewater line upon which a building is or will be constructed so as to produce deleterious wastewater shall use and connect such building to the city wastewater system, when such building is located within the city wastewater service area (as may be amended from time to time) and the city wastewater system is available for connection. The city wastewater system is deemed available for connection and a mandatory connection to the city wastewater system shall occur as follows: 
(1)  For all new residential subdivisions, as defined in the Longwood Development Code, connection to the city wastewater system shall be mandatory. This shall include new subdivisions of three or more lots created by replatting existing lots. 
(2)  For all lots or land parcels with a commercial, infill and mixed use, neighborhood commercial mixed use, or industrial land use designation, connection to the city wastewater system shall be mandatory. 
(3)  For all lots or land parcels, regardless of the land use designation, connection shall be mandatory when the city wastewater system is within 50 feet of the property line as accessed via existing public rights-of-way or easements. 
(4)  For all lots and land parcels, regardless of the land use designation, connection shall be mandatory, regardless of the distance from the property line to the city wastewater system, when: (i) the county health department has denied a permit for construction or reconstruction of an onsite wastewater disposal system, or (ii) the private sewage treatment and disposal system or septic tank fails or is not properly functioning. In such case, the private sewage treatment and disposal system or septic tank shall be cleaned and abandoned as directed by the city and any other applicable controlling regulatory agency. 
(5)  The owner of a properly functioning private sewage treatment and disposal system (including a septic tank) must connect the system or the building's plumbing to the city wastewater sewer system within 365 days after written notification by the city that the city wastewater sewer system is available for connection. The private sewage treatment and disposal system or septic tank shall be cleaned and abandoned as directed by the city and any other applicable controlling regulatory agency. No less than one year prior to the date the city wastewater sewer system will become available, the city will notify the affected owner of the private sewage treatment and disposal system or septic tank of the anticipated availability of the city wastewater sewer system and shall also notify the owner that the owner will be required to connect to the city wastewater sewer system within one year of the actual availability. However, if the city wastewater sewer system was already available for connection prior to July 30, 2016, then the city shall have the right to send written notice at any time and require the affected owner of the private sewage treatment and disposal system or septic tank to connect to the city wastewater sewer system within one year after said written notice. If the connection to the city wastewater sewer is timely made by the owner, the owner shall have the option of prepaying the amortized value of required connection charges in equal monthly installments over a period not to exceed two years from the date of the initial notification of anticipated availability. The foregoing does not limit the city's ability to provide for a longer installment payment schedule by way of ordinance or resolution. 
(b)  The city commission may, upon a finding of extraordinary circumstances and approval of the health department, if applicable, waive or extend the requirements of subsection (a). To request a waiver or an extension, an applicant must submit a request, accompanied by applicable fees and any additional information that may be required, along with a written justification for the requested waiver or extension to the city engineer.

Sec. 90-56. - Water conservation rebate program. 
(a)  Program description. In an effort to assist residents and businesses with increasing water cost, the city is creating the water conservation rebate program. While most residents and businesses will simply appreciate lower water bills, the impact of reducing water consumption for a significant number of homes and businesses has far reaching environmental and financial benefits. Water conservation reduces the demand for water from the Floridan Aquifer and reduces the amount of chemicals and energy needed for the production of potable water. It is easy to see the ripple effect created by making simple improvements at your home or business to reduce water consumption. 
The program provides residents and businesses a financial incentive of $50.00 to $150.00 to install water conserving plumbing fixtures and irrigation controls in their homes or businesses. The rebate is available to any resident or business located in the city to reduce water consumption in their home or business. 
(b)  Eligible improvements and rebate criteria. The following is a list of improvements and eligibility requirements that will qualify for a rebate under this program: 
(1)  Toilets—WaterSense&reg; only (1.28 gallons per flush or less): 
a.  A rebate of $100.00 per toilet for the replacement of existing 3.5 to seven gallons per flush (GPF) toilets. 
b.  Toilets are limited to WaterSense&reg; only 1.28 gallons per flush or less. 
c.  Limit two toilets per household or business within the city limits. 
(2)  Rain sensors—All: 
a.  A rebate of $50.00 per household or business to add or replace the rain sensor connect to an existing irrigation system. 
b.  Limit one rain sensor per household or business every five years. 
c.  For residents and businesses within the city limits only. 
(3)  Irrigation controllers with a moisture sensing device: 
a.  A rebate of $150.00 per household or business to add an irrigation controller that uses "smart" irrigation control technology. For a complete list, visit the WaterSense website. 
b.  Limit one rain sensor per household or business every five years. 
c.  For residents and businesses within the city limits only. 
(c)  Application and allocation process. 
(1)  The applicant or a licensed contractor can perform the installation of the toilet or irrigation control. A building permit is not required. 
(2)  The rebate is for the cost of equipment only. It does not apply to installation cost or sales taxes. 
(3)  A complete application package shall be submitted to the community development services department. The application shall include a description of the project, product descriptions and/or specifications necessary to provide proof of eligibility, before and after photos, and proof of purchase from the retailer/supplier or the final invoice from the contractor who performed the work. 
(4)  Staff will review the application for completeness and eligibility. Eligible applications will be processed for payment after the application is deemed complete. Applications are taken on a first come first serve basis. The city reserves the right to discontinue or amend the program at any time.

ARTICLE III. - CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL 
 
Sec. 90-81. - Definitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Air gap separation means the unobstructed vertical distance through the free atmosphere between the lowest opening from any pipe or faucet supplying water to a tank, plumbing fixture or other device and the flood level rim of the receptacle and shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe, measured vertically above the flood level rim of the vessel. In no case shall the gap be less than one inch. 
Auxiliary supply means any water source or system, other than the public water supply, that may be available in the building or premises. 
Backflow means the flow, in other than the intended direction of flow, of any foreign liquids, gases or substances into the distribution system of a public water supply. 
Backflow prevention device means an assembly composed of two single, independently acting, check valves, including tightly closing shutoff valves, located at each end of the assembly and suitable connections for testing the watertightness of each check valve. 
Back pressure means backflow caused by a pump, elevated tank, boiler or other means that could create pressure within the system greater than the supply pressure. 
Back siphonage means a form of backflow due to a negative or subatmospheric pressure within a water system. 
Cross connection means any physical arrangement whereby a public water supply is connected, directly or indirectly, with any other water supply system, sewer, drain, conduit, pool, storage reservoir, plumbing fixture, or other device which contains, or may contain, contaminated water, sewage, or other waste or liquid of unknown or unsafe quality which may be capable of imparting contamination to the public water supply as a result of backflow, bypass arrangements, jumper connections, removable sections, swivel or changeover devices, and other temporary or permanent devices through which, or because of which, backflow could occur are considered to be cross connections. 
Public water supply means any system or water supply intended or used for consumption or other domestic uses including source, treatment, storage, transmission and distribution facilities where water is furnished to any community, collection or number of individuals or is made available to the public for human consumption or domestic use. 
Reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device means a device incorporating two or more check valves and an automatically operating differential relief valve located between the two check valves, two shutoff valves, and equipped with the necessary appurtenances for testing. The device shall operate to maintain the pressure in the zone between the two check valves, less than the pressure on the public water supply side of the device. At cessation of normal flow, the pressure between the check valves shall be less than the supply pressure. In case of leakage of either check valve, the differential relief valve shall operate to maintain this reduced pressure by discharging to the atmosphere. When the inlet pressure is two pounds per square inch or less, the relief valve shall open to the atmosphere, thereby providing an air gap in the device.

(a)  All cross connections, whether or not such cross connections are controlled by automatic devices such as check valves or by hand-operated mechanisms such as gate valves or stop cocks, are hereby prohibited. 
(b)  Failure on the part of the person to discontinue the use of any and all cross connections and to physically separate such cross connections shall be sufficient cause for the discontinuance of public water service to the premises on which the cross connection exists. 
(Code 1982, § 23-44)  
Sec. 90-84. - Inspections. 
The city may make periodic inspections of premises served by the water supply to check for the presence of cross connections. Any cross connections found in such inspection shall be ordered removed by the city. If an immediate hazard to health is caused by the cross connection, water service to the premises shall be discontinued until it is verified that the cross connection has been removed. 
(Code 1982, § 23-45)  
Sec. 90-85. - Backflow prevention device installation; type; location; inspection; testing; failure to comply. 
(a)  Installation required. Backflow prevention devices shall be installed at the service connection or within any premises where, in the judgment of the city, the nature and extent of the activities on the premises, or the materials used in connection with the activities or materials stored in the premises, would present an immediate and dangerous hazard to health should a cross connection occur, even though such cross connection does not exist at the time the backflow prevention device is required to be installed. This shall include but not be limited to the following situations: 
(1)  Premises having an auxiliary water supply, unless the quality of the auxiliary supply is in compliance with applicable federal laws and is acceptable to the city. 
(2)  Premises having internal cross connections that are not correctable, or intricate plumbing arrangements which make it impractical to ascertain whether or not cross connections exist. 
(3)  Premises where entry is restricted so that inspections for cross connections cannot be made with sufficient frequency or at sufficiently short notice to assure that cross connections do not exist. 
(4)  Premises having a repeated history of cross connections being established or reestablished. 
(5)  Premises on which any substance is handled under pressure so as to permit entry into the public water supply, or where cross connections could be reasonably expected to occur. This shall include the handling of process waters and cooling waters. 
(6)  Premises where materials of a toxic nature are handled such that if backsiphonage should occur, a serious health hazard may result. 
(7)  The following types of facilities shall fall into one of the above categories where a backflow prevention device is required to protect the public water supply. A backflow prevention device shall be installed at these facilities: 
Hospitals, mortuaries, clinics (doctors' offices); 
Animal hospitals; 
Laboratories; 
Piers and docks; 
Schools;

Other facilities specified by the city. 
(b)  Type. The type of protection device shall be determined by the city and shall depend on the degree of hazard which exists. 
(c)  Health or system hazard. An air gap separation or a reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device shall be installed where the water supply may be contaminated with sewage, industrial waste of a toxic nature or other contaminant which would cause a health or system hazard. 
(d)  Objectionable but not hazardous. In the case of a substance which may be objectionable, but not hazardous to health, a double check valve assembly, airgap separation or a reduced pressure principle backflow prevention device shall be installed. 
(e)  Location. Backflow prevention devices shall be installed at the meter or at a location designated by the city. The device shall be located so as to be readily accessible for maintenance and testing and where no part of the device shall be submerged or buried below ground level unless in a watertight container. 
(f)  Testing. Backflow prevention devices shall be installed by the owners of the premises at no expense to the city and shall be tested and certified by a certified backflow technician. Required testing may be conducted by the city for the actual cost of service provided. 
(g)  Approved devices. Any protective devices required in this section shall be a model approved by the city. A backflow prevention device shall be approved if it has successfully passed a performance test of the University of Southern California Engineering Center or other testing laboratories satisfactory to the city. 
(h)  Inspection, testing, repairs. Residential and nonresidential backflow prevention devices shall be annually inspected, tested and certified to the city at the customer's expense. The devices shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced at the customer's expense whenever they are found to be defective. Inspection, tests and repair records shall be kept by the city at the customer's expense. 
(i)  Failure to comply. Failure of the customer to cooperate in the installation, maintenance, testing or inspection of backflow prevention devices required in this section shall be grounds for the termination of water service to the premises.

(8)  Failure to comply with requirements of the city public utilities service policy and codes, as may be amended from time to time. 
(d)  The city shall give the applicant, or successor in interest according to city records, 30 calendar days written notice of its intent to recapture reserved or allocated service capacity as provided above. The notice shall contain the basis for the intended recapture and state what corrective action is required to preserve the service capacity reservation or allocation. During the 30-day period, the applicant may take corrective action to comply with the requirements of the policy. If an applicant is unable to complete the corrective action within the 30-day period, a request for an extension to re-recapture date may be submitted to the city. The request for an extension shall be reviewed by the city and, if approved, one extension may be granted, subject to the applicant paying the development assistance fee differential (prevailing total fees due less amount already paid) at the time of and as a condition of obtaining a building permit. Any staff decision regarding the recapture of service capacity, as provided in the policy, may be appealed to the city commission. 
(Code 1982, § 23-48(h))  
Sec. 90-119. - Development assistance fees subject to change. 
Development assistance fees may be changed at any time, subject to approval by the city commission. Applicants who have secured and paid in full for service capacity shall not be subject to such fee revisions, provided that they are in compliance with the City Code. Applicants who have reserved service capacity prior to December 1, 1989, and who have outstanding development assistance fee obligations shall pay at current total fee rates. In special cases, the city commission may elect to finance infrastructure improvements through user fees to be calculated on a pro rata basis of daily flow. 
(Code 1982, § 23-48(i))  
Sec. 90-120. - City/developer cost sharing. 
(a)  It is the intent of the city to require all new development within the city service area to connect, at the owner or developer of said development's expense, to the city public utilities system where available. At times, this may require extensive construction, installation and extension of utility lines from their current terminus to the new development and along the development's frontage adjacent to or within public rights-of-way, at the expense of the owner or developer of said development. The development may, if determined by the city to be necessary, be required to grant the city utility easements of a reasonable width and length to accommodate the perpetual operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of said utility lines over, under and through a portion of the property being developed. Except for upsizing costs reimbursement described in subsection (b), the owner shall not be entitled to development assistance fees credits, connection fees credits, wholesale capacity charges credits, or any other compensation for the installation of utility lines required by this chapter. As used in this section, the term "utility lines" shall mean all potable water, reclaimed water and sanitary sewer main lines, meters, valves, lift stations, manholes, and other appurtenances thereto required to be installed in conformance with the city's public utilities master plan. 
(b)  The owner or developer shall cause the construction of the utility lines required to serve the development in accordance with the city public utilities master plan and the City of Longwood Manual of Standards for the Design, Construction and Maintenance of Water and Wastewater Systems as determined by the city. If any public utilities system facilities identified or required in the master plan exceed those required for the individual development, the city, at its option, shall determine and require upsizing of utility lines to meet those identified facilities in the master plan. The city shall pay the reasonable cost difference between the individual development utility lines requirements and the upsizing requirements of the city within 60 days after completion, inspection and acceptance for the installation of the upsizing as described in subsection (c) and the city's approval of the reasonable cost difference. All public utilities lines, utility system additions, improvements and upsizing shall become property of the city upon final inspection and approval by the city as evidenced by a certificate of completion and issuance of a final clearance by the state department of environmental protection, if required. The owner's or developer's licensed civil engineer shall calculate the cost difference of the facilities. This cost difference shall be subject to review, modification and approval by the city. Construction variations to the master plan shall require approval of the city and shall only be allowed when an extreme hardship can be demonstrated. 
(c)  Completion of utilities. Upon completion of the installation of the utility lines, the owner or developer of the development shall have the city inspect such improvements and obtain a certificate of completion from the city for the utility lines. As a condition precedent to receiving a certificate of completion for such utility lines, owner or developer shall cause the execution and delivery to the city of the following: 
(1)  A final clearance for the utility lines by the state department of environmental protection, if required; 
(2)  Invoices for construction costs of the utility lines; 
(3)  For utility lines construction costs exceeding $100,000.00, unless waived by written agreement with the city, a one-year maintenance bond or irrevocable letter of credit in an amount equal to 20 percent of the utility lines construction costs (construction cost amount to be approved by city engineer) guaranteeing the proper construction, functioning and maintenance of the utility lines for a one-year period following the city's issuance of a certificate of completion, such being in a form approved by the city attorney; 
(4)  A bill of sale conveying the utility lines to the city with an assignment of any associated warranties; 
(5)  A release or waiver of liens from all contractors, subcontractors, materialmen and laborers involved in the installation of the utility lines; and 
(6)  The design engineer of record certification to the city that the utility lines have been completed in accordance with approved design plans. 
No certificates of occupancy shall be issued for any part of the development until issuance of a certificate of completion by the city and completion of subsections (1)—(6) above. The utility lines shall be deemed completed upon owner or developer satisfying all of the conditions of this subsection (c).

(3)  If the amount set forth in the notice of nonpayment is not paid within 30 days from the date of the notice of nonpayment, then: 
a.  The outstanding balance owed to the city shall accrue interest at the rate of 15 percent per annum until such amount is paid in full; 
b.  The city may proceed to record a notice of lien against the applicable property in the official records of the county. Once recorded, the notice of lien shall constitute a lien against the property described therein; and 
c.  A copy of the notice of lien shall be served by U.S. Mail to the applicant and the property owner at the same addresses as set forth in subsection (1) above. 
(4)  After the expiration of 60 days from the date of recording of the notice of lien, a suit may be filed to foreclose said lien. Such foreclosure proceedings shall be instituted and prosecuted in conformity with the procedures for the foreclosure of liens as set forth in the Florida Statutes. The city shall also have the right to bring an action for monetary judgment to collect past due amounts owed. 
(5)  The owner shall be responsible for and the city shall be entitled to reimbursement for the payment of all collection expenses and costs, including attorneys' fees and litigation costs and recording and filing fees, incurred by the city in the collection of fees and charges, filing of liens and in actions to foreclose such liens or actions for a monetary judgment. 
(6)  If development assistance fees, connection fees, wholesale capacity charges, or any portion or combination thereof, have not been paid when due, the city shall have the right to, without notice, immediately withhold the issuance of and not process for review any certificate of occupancy, development permit or development order applications associated with the development and property at issue and may issue and enforce a stop work order on construction associated with the development and property at issue until such fees and charges and the city's associated collection costs are paid in full. 
(7)  The collection and enforcement procedures set forth in this section shall be cumulative with, supplemental to and in addition to, any applicable procedures provided in any other ordinance or administrative regulations of the city, any applicable law or administrative regulation of the state, or any agreement. Failure of the city to follow the procedure set forth in this section shall not constitute a waiver of its rights to proceed under any other ordinances or administrative regulations of the city, any applicable law or administrative regulation of the state, or any agreement.

ARTICLE II. - LAND USE DISTRICTS AND OVERLAY DISTRICTS 
 
2.1.0. - Generally. 
2.1.1. Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to describe the uses of land that are allowable within the City of Longwood. In order to accomplish this purpose all land within the city is divided into districts by the Longwood Comprehensive Plan and the future land use map (FLUM) contained within that plan. The allowable uses are described generally within the future land use element of the plan and more specifically in section 2.2.0 of this development code. 
2.1.2. Interpretation of district boundaries. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts shown on the future land use map, the following rules shall apply. 
A.  Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets, highways, alleys, or other public rights-of-way shall be construed to follow such centerlines. Where the street, highway, alley, or right-of-way has been vacated through official action of the governing body, the boundary shall be construed to follow the centerline of the vacated right-of-way. 
B.  Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot lines, section lines, or tract lines, shall be construed to follow such lines. 
C.  Boundaries indicated as approximately following city limits lines shall be construed to follow such city limits lines. 
D.  Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed to be midway between the main tracks. 
E.  Boundaries indicated as following shorelines shall be construed to follow such shorelines, and in the event of change in the shoreline shall be construed as moving with the actual shoreline; boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of canals, streams, or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow such centerlines. 
F.  Boundaries indicated as parallel to features described in subsections A through E above shall be construed as parallel to such features at the distance from the feature indicated on the FLUM. If a distance is not indicated on the future land use map, the distance shall be determined by the scale of the map. 
G.  Where features existing on the ground are different than those shown on the future land use map, or where other uncertainty exists, the community development director shall render an interpretation on the location of the boundary line in question. 
(Ord. No. 10-1929, § 1, 9-27-2010)  
2.2.0. - Adoption of districts.

_____
2.3.2. Location of public facilities. Nothing in this section shall preclude necessary City of Longwood or other government facilities that provide essential services and serve direct needs of residents of the City of Longwood from locating within any future land use designation when such activity satisfies established criteria of the Comprehensive Plan and the city's Land Development Code. 
(Ord. No. 15-2065 , § 1, 8-17-2015) 
2.3.3. Accessory residential use in industrial. Residential uses are limited to 40 percent of the square footage of the industrial use. No single family residential uses are allowed. Uses in this category shall not have access from local or residential streets. 
2.3.4. Uses not listed. For uses that are not listed, the community development director may approve similar uses based upon an evaluation of projected impacts in terms of parking, trip generation, environmental impact, impact on city facilities, consistency with Comprehensive Plan and Development Code standards, and/or other pertinent factors. The community development director may condition such approval in order to mitigate such use's impact on city facilities and ensure compatibility with adjacent properties and consistency with the Comprehensive Plan and Development Code standards. Uses that are not listed in this table and are not determined to be similar in impact are considered prohibited in the City of Longwood. 
(Ord. No. 08-1874, § 2, 10-20-2008; Ord. No. 10-1929, § 1, 9-27-2010; Ord. No. 11-1956, § 1, 3-7-2011; Ord. No. 11-1969, § 1, 8-15-2011; Ord. No. 16-2088 , § 1, 6-20-2016; Ord. No. 18-2136 , § 3, 6-18-2018) 
2.3.5. Duplexes. Duplexes are allowed only when the proposed lot is an existing lot of record. A lot split that adjusts a property line for the purposes of a duplex may be allowed, however no other subdivision shall be allowed for the purposes of duplexes. 
(Ord. No. 14-2049 , § 1, 4-20-2015)  
2.4.0. - Overlay districts. 
2.4.1. Historic overlay district. The City of Longwood establishes a historic overlay district depicted on the FLUM. The purpose of the historic overlay district is to ensure that rehabilitation rather than demolition of historic structures is carried out, unless there are no economic or reasonable alternatives to demolition. The purpose of the historic overlay district is also to ensure that all public and private development and redevelopment within the district conforms to the adopted Longwood Historic District Code Book and Master Plan. 
2.4.2. [Longwood Design Guidebook adopted.] The Longwood Design Guidebook is hereby adopted by reference and incorporated herein. 
(Ord. No. 10-1929, § 1, 9-27-2010) 
2.4.3. Heritage village district. The Heritage Village Urban Code is adopted as Article XII of this Land Development Code and adopted by reference as a standalone document. 
2.4.4. Opportunity node overlay zones. The intent of the opportunity node overlay zone is to provide incentives to promote the development of high quality, pedestrian oriented, mixed use areas, consisting of retail, office, residential, governmental, hospitality uses, along with conscientiously designed open space(s). It is intended that these districts will be a primary focus of community activity. Standards for the opportunity node overlay zones are found in LDC 3.11.0. 
(Ord. No. 11-1956, § 1, 3-7-2011; Ord. No. 12-1992, § 1, 9-4-2012; Ord. No. 16-2088 , § 1, 6-20-2016)  
ARTICLE III. - DEVELOPMENT DESIGN STANDARDS 
 
3.1.0. - Generally. 
3.1.1. Purpose. The purpose of this article is to provide development design standards applicable to both public and private development activity within the City of Longwood. 
3.1.2. Principles of development design. Development design shall first take into account the protection of natural resources as prescribed in this LDC. All development shall be designed to avoid unnecessary impervious surface cover; to provide adequate access to lots and sites; and to ensure appropriate site design. All engineering plans submitted pursuant to the requirements of this article shall be signed and sealed by a registered professional civil engineer or architect. 
(Ord. No. 10-1929, § 1, 9-27-2010) 
3.1.3. Applicability within existing neighborhoods. Where standards are provided that require new development to be consistent or compatible with an existing subdivision or existing neighborhood, the greatest weight shall be given to development within the city limits of the City of Longwood. This means that, while a study area that defines an "existing neighborhood" or "surrounding neighborhood" may include territory that is both within and without the corporate limits of Longwood, determinations of consistency and compatibility shall be based on the development patterns and other required features, as they exist within the corporate limits of Longwood. Refer to the definition of "surrounding neighborhood" in article I, which also applies to the term "existing neighborhood" or "neighborhood." 
3.1.4. Applicability within land use districts and overlay districts. The design standards described for a land use district shall apply to all development within that district. In addition, standards for development within an overlay district shall apply. Where conflict arises between standards for the underlying land use district and any overlay district, the overlay district standards shall take precedence. In addition to standards for all development within a land use district, supplemental standards are provided for specified individual uses. These supplemental standards are described in article V. Where conflict arises between standards for the land use district and a specified use, the stricter standard shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 14-2049 , § 1, 4-20-2015) 
3.1.5. Applicability of design standards. The design standards contained in this Longwood Development Code and the City of Longwood Manual of Standards (for the design, construction and maintenance of water and wastewater systems), and the public works design standards (for city streets, stormwater systems, subdivision and site development) shall be utilized for all development within the City of Longwood. 
3.1.6. Longwood Design Guidebook. The Longwood Design Guidebook shall serve as a visioning tool for areas outside of the heritage village. 
(Ord. No. 07-1828, § 1, 5-21-2007; Ord. No. 12-1992, § 1, 9-4-2012; Ord. No. 14-2049 , § 1, 4-20-2015) 
3.1.7. Heritage Village Urban Code. All development and redevelopment within the heritage village shall conform to the standards of the Heritage Village Urban Code. The Heritage Village Redevelopment Strategy shall serve as the primary visioning tool for the district. Where a conflict arises between the Heritage Village Urban Code and this Development Code, the standard of the Heritage Village Urban Code shall control. For any standard not described in the Heritage Village Urban Code, the standard established by the Development Code shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 12-1992, § 1, 9-4-2012)

_____ 
A.  Setbacks and building height for nonresidential and mixed use development and redevelopment shall be as established by the Longwood Development Code and the Heritage Village Urban Code. Setbacks are measured from the vertical plane of the structure. Eaves and overhangs are allowed to encroach into the setbacks by no more than two feet. For zero lot line developments with multi-family buildings, including townhome subdivisions, setbacks shall be measured from the outer edges of the multi-family building without regard to the individual lots created. 
B.  Reserved. 
C.  Any development reviewed as a planned development pursuant to section 10.4.0 of this Land Development Code, that contains adjoining parcels in both the IND and IMU categories may utilize all applicable standards of either the IND or IMU land use for the entire project. 
D.  Setbacks and height requirements for accessory structures are as follows: 
1.  Accessory structures including, but not limited to, accessory dwelling units, sheds, screen enclosures, dumpster enclosures, decks, patios, swimming pools, hot tubs, and their associated deck/patio areas, attached canopies, condenser units and pads may encroach into the side and rear setbacks and shall maintain a distance from the property line of no less than seven feet (or three feet in MDR-15 and MDR-7). 
2.  Where the side setback in a district is less than seven feet, the accessory structure encroachment shall be reduced to match the principal setback. 
3.  For single family homes, accessory structures shall not project beyond the established front building line of the main residence. 
4.  Accessory structures shall not exceed a height of 15 feet. Structures attached to primary buildings (i.e. screened porches or canopies) may exceed the height for accessory structures but may not exceed the height of the primary structure. 
5.  For platted subdivisions which include buildings with zero lot lines, accessory structure setbacks may be reduced to three feet. 
6.  The community development director may reduce setback requirements for properties with a rear yard that is fully enclosed by a permitted opaque fence or wall for the placement of patio areas or similar accessory structures, as long as all other requirements including impervious surface requirements and landscape buffers are met and as long as the structure does not exceed the height of the proposed fence. 
No primary structure in MDR-7 or MDR-15 shall be located any closer than 15 feet to the property line of adjoining Low-Density Residential. 
E.  Reserved. 
F.  A current survey, prepared by a surveyor, licensed in the State of Florida, should be submitted for all applications proposing construction, showing all setbacks (front, sides and rear); showing all existing structures on the property, if any and proposed additions or structures, all being fully dimensioned. However, a scaled, proportioned, accurate representation of a survey may be accepted for minor residential construction projects (i.e., fences, sheds, or utility buildings, but not accessory dwelling units). 
G.  Reserved. 
H.  Maximum densities and intensities for the infill and mixed-use category (IMU) and neighborhood commercial mixed-use (NCMU) are established in the Future Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan. Projects that meet the minimum standards of the Longwood Development Code are allowed 80 percent of the maximum density and intensity as established in the Comprehensive Plan. Applicants wishing to receive an amount above 80 percent of the maximum density and intensity must demonstrate that the project exceeds the standards of the Comprehensive Plan, Development Code, and other applicable visioning documents by providing a higher quality of design, defined as significantly exceeding code minimums to accomplish one or all of the following goals: furthering multi-modal transportation options, increasing multi-modal connectivity, providing public amenities, well-designed civic spaces and community activity centers, or providing a horizontal or vertical mix of uses within the project. Projects requesting special exceptions or waivers to the right-of-way standards, street sections, block size requirements, or requirement for liner buildings with parking garages in the Heritage Village Urban Code shall not be eligible to exceed the 80 percent maximum. 
I.  Reserved. 
J.  Calculation of density. The calculation of density for projects shall be as follows: 
(1)  Net developable area. The net developable area shall be based on the calculation of the total area of the parcel or the total area of contiguous parcels under common ownership and submitted for approval under a single development plan, including retention/detention areas, existing ponds, lakes and streams, wetlands, future public rights-of-way, parkland dedication, circulation, recreation facilities, etc., but excluding land in existing public rights-of-way, and any parcels with no allowable density. 
(2)  Calculation. The total amount of units allowed is calculated by multiplying the allowable units per acre for the parcel by the amount in acres of net developable area. All development must be consistent with the standards of the Longwood Development Code. 
(Ord. No. 05-1746, § 2(3.2.1), 4-4-2005; Ord. No. 07-1828, § 2, 5-21-2007; Ord. No. 10-1929, § 1, 9-27-2010; Ord. No. 11-1956, § 1, 3-7-2011; Ord. No. 11-1961, § 1, 5-16-2011; Ord.

No. 18-2136 , § 1, 6-18-2018) 
3.2.2. Lot design standards. 
A.  Lot area standards. There shall be no minimum lot area, provided that all of the following requirements are met. Zero lot line developments, such as townhome subdivisions, are exempt from the lot area requirements where the use is allowable and the overall development is consistent with setbacks, buffering, impervious surface, and other requirements. 
1.  For residential land use districts, lot area shall be consistent with the maximum density of the area. Should cluster development be proposed, appropriate and adequate open space shall be set aside either through dedication to a public agency or homeowners' association, or through a recorded conservation easement. The purpose of the open space set aside is to ensure that the gross density is maintained where smaller lot sizes are proposed in order to achieve cluster development. (Appropriate and adequate open space means the amount of open, undeveloped land necessary to maintain the required gross density and to meet any minimum open space requirements set by the Longwood Comprehensive Plan or this development code. Such open space shall be considered appropriate and adequate if it is contiguous rather than in scattered, small portions of the overall development.) 
2.  For all land use districts, lot area shall be sufficient and adequate to accommodate all site design standards and requirements (such as, but not limited to parking, landscaping, buffers, and stormwater retention areas). 
3.  For all land use districts, lot area shall be consistent with the density for the land use district and compatible with the predominant lot area of the surrounding neighborhood. 
a.  Where larger lot areas are proposed, the proposed lot area shall not be greater than 150 percent of the average of lots in surrounding neighborhood. 
b.  Where smaller lots are proposed, the proposed lot area shall not be less than 70 percent of the average lots that are in the surrounding neighborhood. 
LOT AREA STANDARDS  
B.  Lot dimension standards. There shall be no minimum lot width or lot depth, provided that the following requirements are met. Zero lot line developments, such as townhome subdivisions, are exempt from the lot dimension requirements where the use is allowable and the overall development is otherwise consistent with setbacks, buffering, impervious surface, and other requirements. 
1.  Lot width and lot depth shall be sufficient and adequate to accommodate all site design standards and requirements (such as, but not limited to, parking, access drives, landscaping, buffers, setbacks, and stormwater retention). 
2.  Lot width and depth shall be consistent and compatible with the predominant configuration of lots in the surrounding neighborhood. 
a.  Where large lot widths or lot depths are proposed, the proposed dimensions shall not be greater than 150 percent of the average dimensions of lots in the surrounding neighborhood. 
b.  Where smaller lot widths or lot depths are proposed, the dimension shall not be less than 70 percent of the average dimensions of lots in the surrounding neighborhood. 
LOT DIMENSION STANDARDS  
(Ord. No. 16-2088 , § 1, 6-20-2016; Ord. No. 16-2093 , § 1, 8-15-2016; Ord. No. 16-2107 , § 1, 2-6-2017) 
3.2.3. Design standards for nonresidential, multifamily, and mixed use properties in the City of Longwood. 
A.  Purpose. It is the intent of the City of Longwood to enhance property development for nonresidential and mixed use properties. The specific objectives are enhancement of the visual appearance of development; enhancement of landscape and streetscape; reduction of visual distraction through uniform design for buildings and signs; provision of design standards to achieve a traditional urban character over time; protection of adjacent residential land uses; and protection of property values. 
B.  Applicability. The standards of section 3.2.3 apply to all new nonresidential, multifamily, and mixed-use development and redevelopment. Property within the Heritage Village shall be subject to the regulations within the Heritage Village Urban Code. If a conflict between a guideline and a specific standard arises between the standards of this section and the Heritage Village Urban Code, the Heritage Village Urban Code shall prevail. 
C.  Alternative building design. To provide flexibility in building design, an applicant may request an alternative building design where projects meet some or all of the following criteria: 
1.  The design meets the intent, if not the letter, of the design standards set forth in this section. 
2.  A façade or façades are located in such a manner that the architectural standard is impractical, not feasible, or wholly screened from view by other buildings or other permanent features. 
3.  A variety of other building elements or design techniques, additional screening or landscaping or other site design features are used to mitigate the difference between the standards of this section and the proposed design. 
4.  The design standards of this section are incompatible with a proposed land use or inappropriate for the location, particularly for areas in the Industrial (IND) land use where the project does not face an arterial or Florida Central Parkway. 
D.  Design standards.

B.  The requirements and standards of this section shall apply to all new development and redevelopment, including expansions of commercial, office, industrial, or other nonresidential developments, as well as all multifamily residential development. 
C.  Single-family detached and two-family dwelling units are exempt from the provisions of this section. 
3.5.2. Buffers required. 
A.  Buffer standards. 
1.  Buffers shall be located on the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel, extending to the lot or parcel boundary line, or between differing land uses on a single parcel, but may not occupy any portion of an existing, dedicated, or reserved public or private street, or right-of-way. 
2.  Buffer width is normally measured from the property line; however, design variations are allowed. Average width shall be measured at the two end points of the buffer and two additional points which are each approximately one-third of the total linear distance from the end point. The average width of the buffer shall be that shown in the Table of Buffer Design Standards. 
3.  The buffer shall be designed to eliminate or minimize plantings within drainage, utility, or other easements. 
4.  Buffers shall be designed taking into consideration the site's soils conditions, topography, and natural resources. Native vegetation shall be used for landscaping and buffering unless the applicant demonstrates that the use of nonnative, drought-resistant plants would best serve the site. 
5.  Landscaping within buffer areas shall conform to the plant material standards shown in section 3.5.4. 
B.  Table of required buffers.

3.5.3. General landscaping and open space requirements. 
A.  [ Intent. ] It is the intent of the City of Longwood to maintain and improve the appearance of the city, to protect and improve property values, and to establish an integrated system of landscaping for all multifamily residential and all nonresidential development sites. 
1.  In no case shall any development or redevelopment site within the City of Longwood contain fewer than ten trees per acre located throughout the site. These existing or newly planted trees may be located within the required buffer, the perimeter of the site, or interior landscaped areas. 
2.  An irrigation system, capable of ensuring the establishment and continued growth of the plant materials specified in the landscape plan, shall be constructed within any required landscape areas. 
3.  Landscape plans shall be prepared by a landscape architect, or professional engineer registered in the State of Florida. A landscape plan shall be submitted with the development application. The community development director may waive or modify this requirement in cases where an approved code compliant and fully implemented landscape plan is on file with the city. 
B.  Right-of-way adjacent perimeter landscape areas. For the purposes of this section, right-of-way adjacent perimeter landscape areas shall mean property frontages adjacent to any public right-of-way, including SunRail. A minimum ten-foot wide landscape strip adjacent to the property line adjacent to the right-of-way (except in permitted accessways) shall be provided. Width of sidewalks shall not be included within the landscape area. For new construction, with a zero front yard setback, a landscape area shall not be required, however, street trees at 30 feet on center must be provided. 
1.  Plant material : A right-of-way adjacent landscape area of including no less than three ornamental/understory trees (minimum ten feet tall planting height) and 33 shrubs per 100 feet of linear frontage is required. A continuous hedge of shrubs at no less than 24 inches planting height and planted no more than four feet O.C. shall be installed, though plant material may be grouped into other arrangements within the front perimeter area so long as the total amount of required plant material is maintained. Canopy trees may be substituted in place of the required ornamental/understory trees, but shall not be installed so as to interfere with power lines. 
2.  Ground cover: Grass or other ground cover shall be placed on all areas within the front, and other landscape areas not occupied by landscape material. 
C.  Parking lot landscaping. Parking lots for all new development and all redevelopment that is a change of use or an expansion of an existing use that generates a need for additional parking and requires additional parking areas to support the use shall provide landscaping for the parking lot. The landscaping for a parking lot is based on a performance standard as follows in addition to the plant material standards of LDC 3.5.4. 
1.  Landscape plans shall be prepared by a landscape architect, or professional engineer registered in the State of Florida. A landscape plan shall be submitted with the development application. 
2.  When shade trees are planted on the perimeter of a parking area, they must be planted no closer than five feet and no farther than nine feet from the edge of the pavement, and must provide shade to either the parking area, the primary structure or an adjacent pedestrian area. If an existing tree is used, it should be in the vehicular use area, or within nine feet of the vehicular use area. 
3.  Ten percent of the total parking lot area shall consist of internal landscape islands. There shall be one tree required per 200 square feet of internal landscape areas. Landscape island minimum width dimensions shall conform to the minimum planting area and planting strip width requirements described in section 3.5.4.C. Each landscaped island shall provide a minimum of one canopy tree (12 feet tall at planting, three inches DBH) with shrubs, dwarf shrubs and/or ground cover plants. 
4.  Preservation of existing trees or tree groupings is encouraged. 
5.  Parking lots should be located to the side and rear of buildings where possible. New development with parking in front shall provide additional landscaping 50 percent above the required landscape buffer. 
D.  Open space. Nonresidential and multifamily developments of more than 10,000 square feet in GLA that are within one-fourth mile of SR 434, Ronald Reagan Blvd., or U.S. 17-92 shall reserve at least five percent of the total site area for landscaped and useable pedestrian-oriented open space area(s). Open spaces may include parks, recreational trails, courtyards, landscaped gardens, outdoor dining areas, plazas, and amenitized water features; but shall not include parking or required landscape buffers. Retention ponds may be utilized as part of the required open space only when designed as a feature utilizing features including but not limited to fountains, trails, and benches. The open space may take multiple forms and be in different part of the development, but in no situation shall any section of required open space be less than 35 percent of the total amount of required open space. 
(1)  Where site conditions or elements of a particular use result in a situation where it is determined by the city that open space requirements may be better met off-site, some or all of the open space requirements may be met by the contribution of fees to an appropriate fund to be used by the city for the acquisition and development of land for open space or parks, or, at the discretion of the city, in the form of direct contribution of funds to a city project that advances the city's open space goals. 
(2)  The fee-in-lieu-of calculation shall be (¼)A × V = M, with "A" being the amount of land, in square feet, required for dedication as determined in section (D), "V" being the fair market value of the property as determined in subsection (3), and "M" being the amount to be paid in lieu of open space requirements. 
(3)  For the determination of fair market value or "V" in the equation established by subsection (2), the applicant may select either the actual purchase price of the property to be developed as evidenced by a purchase contract, or a closing statement dated within one year of the date of the application or the current fair market value of the property to be developed by a qualified real estate appraiser. 
(4)  Fees-in-lieu-of open space shall be assessed at the time of application or during the period of project application review and paid prior to final approval of the application for the development. 
E.  Maintenance required. All landscaped areas shall be continually maintained in a healthy, vigorous growing condition, free from disease or pests. Required plants that are diseased or dead shall be replaced with plants of similar species in a substantially similar size to the lost plant. Adequate irrigation shall be required. 
F.  [Minor modifications.] The community development director may provide for modifications to the landscaping requirements of this section. The director may adjust requirements as they relate to size, type, and placement of landscape material where the applicant submits an alternative landscape plan with detailed justification provided that there is no net loss in the total amount of landscape material and that the modification will not result in a reduction of the effectiveness of required landscape buffers between the project and adjoining residentially zoned or utilized parcels. The applicant must make a written request of the director indicating the specific changes requested and demonstrating compliance with this section. 
(Ord. No. 10-1929, § 1, 9-27-2010; Ord. No. 11-1969, § 1, 8-15-2011; Ord. No. 11-1976, § 1, 11-21-2011; Ord. No. 12-1992, § 1, 9-4-2012; Ord. No. 15-2065 , § 1, 8-17-2015; Ord.

3.5.4. Plant material standards. 
A.  Unless otherwise provided herein, only Florida No. 1 or better plant material as described in Grades and Standards for Nursery Plants, Part II, Florida Department of Agriculture, shall be credited on the landscape development requirements of this article. 
B.  A minimum height of 12 feet and three inches (DBH) at the time of planting shall be required for canopy trees. Other trees shall have a minimum height of ten feet at the time of planting. A minimum of three different species of tree shall be provided per site. 
C.  The planting area for each tree shall be as follows. 
1.  A minimum of 200 square feet around the trunk of canopy trees, with a minimum planting strip width of ten feet. 
2.  A minimum of 100 square feet around the trunk of understory or other small trees, with a minimum planting strip width of five feet. 
3.  The planting area for each tree shall be maintained in either vegetative landscape material or pervious surface cover. Trees and shrubs may be grouped or clustered to provide desired landscape design. Tree groups shall be allowed to have a reduced minimum planting area as long as the minimum planting strip width is maintained. No large trees shall be planted closer than five feet from the edge of pavement or curb line. The minimum planting strip width excludes curbs, curb and gutter, or similar edge treatments. 
D.  Shrubs, ground cover, lawn grasses, turf grass, and architectural planters shall be subject to the following: 
1.  Lawn grass shall be perennial species capable of thriving in Seminole County. 
2.  Grass and ground cover shall be perennial species capable of thriving in Seminole County. 
3.  Grass shall be sodded according to city standards. 
4.  Ground cover shall be preferred over grass. Grass may be used in areas proposed for recreation use or to provide erosion control on slopes or in swales. 
5.  Shrubs shall have a planting area of not less than ten square feet with a minimum planting strip width of five feet. Planters may be used, provided that the planting area is provided as required, and the planter has a depth of not less than 18 inches. 
6.  Spacing of shrubs and ground cover shall be typical of the selected species in order to obtain 80 percent surface coverage by the end of a two-year growing period from the time of installation. 
E.  To the extent that is feasible, the performance of development activities and revegetation of altered sites shall be consistent with the following standards. 
1.  Development shall not involve the unnecessary removal of any native vegetation. Where removal of native trees is necessary, efforts should be made to replant native trees. 
2.  Site alteration shall occur in planned stages or increments and not exceed the minimum area necessary to prepare the site for the succeeding phase of development. 
3.  Adequate erosion control measures shall be put into effect prior to commencing site alteration on each increment. 
F.  Water conservation practices are recommended and should be used in landscaping, including the use of native vegetation, xeriscape design, and the use of recycled irrigation water. Where recycled irrigation water is available, the use of the recycled water shall be mandatory. 
(Ord. No. 16-2107 , § 1, 2-6-2017; Ord. No. 17-2129 , § 1, 12-18-2017; Ord. No. 18-2136 , § 1, 6-18-2018) 
3.5.5. Tree protection standards. 
A.  Applicability. Trees protected under this section are those with a trunk diameter of three inches DBH (diameter at breast height) or more. 
B.  Tree removal permit. A tree removal permit or approved site plan shall be required for the removal, replacement, or alteration of trees not otherwise exempted from the provisions of this section. Alteration includes damaging, topping, root pruning, cutting, hatracking, poisoning, or grade change that can be expected to adversely affect the health of protected trees and vegetation. Ordinary maintenance such as seasonal pruning or customary care shall not require a permit. 
C.  Tree permit requirements. 
1.  All tree removal permit applications shall be filed with the community development department, whether or not a site plan or other development approval is required. Review and approval shall be according to the procedures in section 10.1.4. Tree removal and/or replacement as specified on the tree removal permit shall occur within 30 days of the issuance of a tree removal permit. The community development director may grant a one-time 15-day extension upon a written request from the applicant that is received prior to the expiration of the permit and where demonstrable circumstances have prevented the removal or replacement of a tree during the 30-day time period. 
2.  The following information depicted on a tree survey shall be submitted with the application, unless otherwise waived by the community development director: 
a.  Location and identification of all trees (using either common or botanical name), designating trees to be retained, altered, removed, relocated, or replaced. Groups of trees in close proximity may be designated as "clumps" or "dense tree cover" with the estimated number and type(s) of trees noted. Only those trees to be removed, relocated, or replaced must be named on the tree survey or site plan. The tree survey may show only that portion of the site directly involved or affected by the tree removal. 
b.  Location of all existing and proposed structures, improvements, or uses of the site. 
c.  Proposed changes, if any, in site elevations, grades and major contours. 
d.  Location of existing or proposed utilities. 
e.  Location of irrigation system, or drawing notes to indicate method of maintenance. 
3.  If any approvals have previously been provided for the site, such as a site plan, development order, variance, or plat, evidence of such approval shall be provided. 
4.  The applicant shall flag all trees to remain on a site in a manner sufficient to allow field verification of the tree survey and in such a manner that does not damage the tree. 
5.  A copy of the tree removal permit shall be posted on site during construction and tree removal activities. 
D.  Criteria for approval of tree permits. 
1.  Approval for tree removal shall only be granted on a developed lot or a lot with an application for development approval where such tree or trees unreasonably restricts the otherwise allowable use of the property. 
2.  A tree removal permit may be issued where the application is accompanied by a letter from a certified arborist indicating that the tree is diseased, injured, endangers existing structures, interferes with the safe provision of utility services, or creates a hazard to visibility for motorists. 
3.  Replacement or relocation of trees is required as described: 
a.  New developments in site plan review. Site development plans will be required to show all removed and replaced trees. If it is not feasible to place the required number of trees on a developed site, the developer shall make a contribution equal to the number of trees that could not be placed (at three inches DBH per tree) to the off-site tree mitigation fund. 
b.  Developed property with an approved landscape plan. All sites with an approved landscape plan shall replace trees according to the original permitted landscape plan approval, unless the removed tree exceeds 23 inches DBH, at which time the table in (3)(c) will apply. If the tree removed from the site was not part of the approved landscape plan, tree replacement will not be required. 
c.  Property without an approved landscape plan. Where a developed property is not subject to an approved, documented landscape plan, the replacement shall be as follows: 
Diameter of existing Tree (DBH) 	Number of Replacement Trees Required for each tree removed 	Minimum Inches Diameter DBH 	Total Replacement Required Inches Diameter DBH 
6—11 	1 replaced for 1 removed 	3 	3 
12—17 	2 replaced for 1 removed 	3 	6 
18—23 	2 replaced for 1 removed 	4 	8 
24—29 	3 replaced for 1 removed 	4 	12 
>30 	3 replaced for 1 removed 	6 	18 
 
d.  Plant materials used in conformance with the provisions of this Code shall conform to the Standard for Florida No. 1 or better as given in Grades and Standards for Nursery Plants, State of Florida, Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Tallahassee. 
e.  Fees collected in lieu of replacement shall be placed in an off-site tree mitigation account. The fees shall be established by the city commission. 
f.  Trees removed illegally without a permit are subject to a three-to-one replacement, i.e. three inches replacement for each one inch removed. The established fee schedule would apply to this requirement if replacement is not feasible. 
g.  Any retained or relocated tree shall be replaced if the tree dies within one year after final approval. 
h.  Replacement trees shall be of a similar or greater canopy and shade potential as the tree being replaced. 
4.  In considering the application for tree permit and a plan for relocation or replacement of removed trees, the community development director may allow a ten percent reduction in the otherwise required replacement trees (calculated in inches of diameter), based on the following criteria: 
a.  Number, species and size of other trees and vegetation on site. Number, species, size, location and canopy of existing trees. 
b.  Impact on stormwater runoff quantity and quality. 
c.  Character of the site and its environs. 
d.  Characteristics and amount of shrubs, grass, trees, or other vegetation proposed for the site. 
E.  Approved trees. The following trees are approved for installation as replacement trees, installation in required landscaped areas, and buffers. The city manager may also accept requests to use approved Florida-Friendly Landscaping species for replacement.

2.  Trees and other vegetation shall be maintained to ensure that such trees and vegetation continue to be viable and thriving. 
J.  Protection during construction activities. 
1.  Each retained or installed tree shall be protected during all pre-construction and construction activities. The area to be protected shall extend to the drip line of the tree, but shall be no less than a six-foot radius from the trunk of the tree. Where trees are located in clusters or groups, the outermost drip line shall be the area of protection. The location of tree protection areas shall be depicted on the required landscape plan. 
TREE PROTECTION DURING CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES 
 
2.  All development activities, including construction, grading, paving, compaction, trenching, installation of stormwater retention ponds, or the like shall be prohibited. Any existing brush and weeds to be removed inside the tree protection barrier shall be removed with hand tools only. 
3.  Wooden barriers shall be erected around all protected trees or other vegetation during the period of construction activity. 
4.  Barriers shall be constructed of upright posts and railings constructed of lumber at least two inches by four inches in cross-section marked by ribbon, flags, or other easily visible connecting material, and shall extend to or beyond the drip line of all protected trees on the property. Reference "Tree Protection Manual for Builders and Developers" from the Florida Department of Agricultural and Consumer Services, Division of Forestry, for additional guidance on methods of tree protection during construction.

7.  No attachments or wires, other than protective guy wires, shall be attached to any trees or shrubs within protective barriers. 
8.  Installation of artificial barriers such as protective barricades, fences, posts, or walls shall not destroy or irreversibly harm the root systems of protected trees. Footers for walls shall end at the point where larger roots are encountered, and the roots shall be bridged. Postholes and trenches located close to protected trees shall be adjusted to avoid damage to major roots. 
9.  Construction activity, including underground utilities and new impervious surfaces, shall be allowed only with the outer ten percent of an existing tree drip line radius. In no case shall construction activity occur closer than ten feet from the center of the trunk of existing trees to be preserved. 
K.  Planting requirements. 
1.  Tree species with a height greater than 20 feet at maturity shall not be planted within a utility easement when power lines lie directly overhead. 
2.  No tree shall be planted within ten feet of a fire hydrant or utility pole, within 20 feet of a traffic sign, or within 25 feet of an intersection in order to ensure adequate visibility. Should this requirement severely limit the location of trees on the property, the community development director may adjust these specifications. 
L.  Off-site tree mitigation. 
1.  Tree planting requirements for development as described in this LDC may be met by the contribution of fees to an off-site tree mitigation account or, at the discretion of the city, by off-site tree mitigation in the form of either the direct contribution of trees to applicable city projects. 
2.  All funds collected as tree replacement fees shall be administered by the city manager or designee. Disbursements from the tree replacement account shall be made only for the following purposes: 
a.  Purchasing trees for planting and any associated costs in accordance with the city's tree planting program; or 
b.  Protection of trees and enforcement of this ordinance. 
3.  Fees for the off-site tree mitigation account are established by the city commission in the schedule of fees. 
4.  Fees for the off-site tree mitigation account shall be reviewed annually by the city commission to reflect the cost of living adjustments and/or market conditions and may be modified by approval of the city commission. In establishing fees, the city shall consider the cost of material, labor, transportation, planting, watering, and mortality rate of replacement trees. 
5.  Trees authorized for off-site mitigation shall be planted in city-owned properties and parks, city rights of way, and preservation and conservation areas owned by the city. The city may also plant trees within the medians and rights of way of state and county roads where an interlocal agreement authorizes such plantings. 
6.  Fees for off-site mitigation shall be paid to the city prior to the issuance of any tree removal permit or building permit for new construction with an approved site plan or plat. 
7.  The city may agree to allow an applicant to provide trees to satisfy landscape requirements directly to city projects in lieu of a contribution of fees when consistent with this LDC and the following guidelines: 
a.  Trees provided as a contribution in lieu of fees must meet all applicable requirements for size and planting described in this section.

3.11.0. - Opportunity Node Overlay Zone (ONOZ). 
3.11.1. Generally. 
A.  Purpose. The specific purposes of the Opportunity Node Overlay Zones (ONOZ) are to an provide an optional incentivized opportunity to create new development projects on identified parcels which act as catalysts for redevelopment within the City. Projects developed consistent with the ONOZ will provide a mixture of uses, integrated and programmable public open spaces, provide a pedestrian-friendly environment in both design and scale; encourage creativity, variety and excellence in project design and layout; and utilize a development review and approval process that meets these purposes without causing undue delays. Toward this end, mixed-use projects containing commercial, office, residential uses and common spaces are required. Controls are applied to this district allowing flexibility but requiring integrated design within the development; limited access to the existing public roadways, and integrated vehicular and pedestrian facilities within the development and between adjacent developments. ONOZ developments will be designed to ensure compatibility with, and minimum impact upon, existing and future residential development in the area. The district is not intended to be accomplished in a fragmented, lot-by-lot fashion or developed with a single type of land use. The commercial, office and residential components will be developed concurrently in order to insure the achievement of a development with multiple uses. The design of ONOZ developments should be predominated by building and landscape design elements that encourage connectivity and which collectively create a village square, marketplace or main street atmosphere. ONOZ developments will therefore be developed with a variable but coordinated architectural theme having equal emphasis on pedestrian movement and vehicular circulation. The overall arrangement of buildings should create an internal traffic flow and focus for both vehicles and pedestrians. 
B.  Objectives. The ONOZ provisions are designed to: 
1.  Permit outstanding and innovative mixed use development with a building orientation toward streets and sidewalks; provide for an integration of housing types and accommodation of changing lifestyles within neighborhoods; and provide for design which encourages internal and external convenient and comfortable travel by foot, bicycle, and transit through such strategies as narrow streets, modest setbacks, front porches, connected streets, multiple connections to nearby land uses, and mixed uses. 
2.  Provide flexibility to meet changing needs, technologies, economics and consumer preferences. 
3.  Promote the integration and enhancement of existing and outstanding landscape features and scenic vistas. 
4.  Lower development and building costs by permitting smaller networks of utilities, a network of narrower streets, and the use of more economical development patterns and shared facilities. 
5.  Achieve overall coordinated building and facility relationships and infill development, and eliminate the negative impacts of unplanned and piecemeal development. 
6.  Enhance the combination and coordination of architectural styles, building forms and building relationships within the development. 
7.  Require the use of traditional, quality-of-life design features, such as pedestrian scale, parking located to the side or rear of buildings, narrow streets, connected streets, terminated vistas, front porches, recessed garages, alleys, aligned building façades that face the street, and formal landscaping along streets and sidewalks. 
8.  Promotes the incorporation of sustainable design practices including alternative energy sources, increases walkability, encourages biking and fosters choice in transportation, green building techniques, and sustainable landscaping and stormwater management. 
3.11.2. Minimum incentives for the Opportunity Node Overlay Zone . An applicant for an ONOZ designation must present evidence that justifies the incentives allowed as part of the ONOZ. Justification must include one or more of the following: 
A.  By opting in to the opportunity node overlay zone, the applicant shall, upon meeting the minimum requirements of this section, be eligible for certain development incentives, including as a starting point, but not limited to: 
1.  A waiver of planning division application fees. 
2.  A waiver of 20 percent of building permit fees 
3.  A waiver of 20 percent of the water and wastewater development assistance fees 
4.  An assigned project facilitator

Additional incentives including administrative approvals, fee waivers and infrastructure assistance may be available. 
3.11.3. Review process and requirements. 
A.  Pre-Application Conceptual Plan Review. Any applicant seeking to utilize the ONOZ incentives provided under this section shall submit a conceptual plan, along with an ONOZ Application form to the Community Development Department and schedule a pre-application meeting to discuss procedures, requirements, and the consistency of the proposal with this section. 
1.  The Community Development Director will make a determination as to whether the conceptual proposal is generally consistent with the requirements of this section and thus eligible for the fee waivers and expedited processing under this section. 
2.  During conceptual review, no comment concerning a proposed development concept shall be relied upon by the applicant or any other person as representation or implication that the particular concept proposed will ultimately be approved in any form. 
B.  Major site plan submittal. The applicant shall follow the procedure for a major site development plan described in section 10.2.0 of this Land Development Code and additional requirements as described by this section, with the exception that a DRC meeting shall not be required. A CAPP meeting shall be required unless waived by the Community Development Director. 
C.  Requirements and evaluation of ONOZ Application. The applicant shall submit a report explaining how the development intends to address each item in the subsections below. The Community Development Director shall make a determination as to whether the project meets the minimum ONOZ requirements. 
1.  Conformance with the ONOZ objectives, the Land Development Code, and the Comprehensive Plan. No development plan may be approved unless it is consistent with the objectives set forth in this section and the Comprehensive Plan and any and all applicable documents. Where the standards of this section are in conflict with another applicable standard, the standards of this section shall prevail. 
2.  Mix of uses. The development shall include both commercial (retail, service, office) and residential uses. No single use shall exceed 75 percent of the total floor area of the development. 
3.  Allowable uses. Uses allowed in the ONOZ Overlay include: Multi-family housing in the form of townhouses, apartments, brownstone apartments, or similar configuration, single-family residential with a minimum density of 10 du/acre, retail, department stores, hotels, offices, medical offices, performing arts centers, theaters, community centers, government offices, parks, plazas, schools and colleges, banks and financial institutions, indoor commercial recreation facilities, personal service establishments excluding massage therapy, standard and fast-food restaurants, outdoor cafes, and accessory uses to these uses. 
4.  Core design requirements. In order to be eligible for the incentives provided by this section, developments must meet all applicable standards of the Longwood Development Code and the following core design requirements: 
(a)  Site design. 
(1)  New developments are required to have buildings along the primary frontage that are no more than 15 feet from the property line. 
(2)  At least 20 percent of the site shall be designed as programmable open space. This can include parks, amenitized water features including lakefronts and stormwater facilities, plazas, courtyards, greenways. Open space shall be designed as a central feature of the development, immediately visible and accessible from the primary frontage of the development. 
(3)  Stormwater facilities and lake frontages shall be integrated as an opportunity rather than an afterthought and shall be designed programmable open space. Stormwater ponds are to be designed as integrated open space amenities within the development and shall be curvilinear in nature and shall not be fenced. Where no alternative to this standard exists, as is determined by the city engineer, stormwater facilities that require fencing may be approved, however these will not count toward open space or overall lot area. Features that may be used to create open space areas acceptable may include, without limitation, boardwalks, plazas, fixed benches and tables, fountains, pathways, bikeways, bicycle racks, shade trees, and perennial gardens. 
(b)  Pedestrian and bicycle facilities. The project shall be designed to include safe, thoughtfully-designed facilities for pedestrians, bicylists, and automobiles. 
(1)  An interconnected network of sidewalks shall connect each building in the development to each other and to any other existing, adjacent sidewalk network. Clear pedestrian pathways shall be provided between buildings on the same lot and between buildings on adjacent lots to ensure a continuous pedestrian pathway throughout the district. All pedestrian pathways shall be shaded by means of awnings or similar, or canopy trees planted no less than 40 feet O.C. 
(2)  Buildings shall be oriented toward each other in a way that minimizes conflicts between pedestrians and automobiles. 
(3)  Internal streets shall be designed with street trees, on-street parking, traffic calming devices, and, where applicable, buildings that address the street with entries, windows, balconies, canopies, and planters. 
(c)  Interactive with adjacent properties. 
(1)  Where a development designed under this section is adjacent to existing residential, the residential portion of the project shall be oriented towards the existing residential. 
(2)  Where multiple types of residential occur in a development, the least dense development shall be adjacent to existing single-family residential or the impacts shall be mitigated. 
(3)  When a proposed commercial or industrial development is adjacent to a parcel with a future land use of LDR or MDR, an eight-foot tall brick wall shall be erected along all property lines where the two land uses meet. Stone or a material that duplicates the quality and material of brick or stone, including stucco, split face block, and precast concrete or synthetic walls, may also be used in lieu of brick. If the development borders a lake or conservation area, those sides which front the lake or conservation area shall not require a wall. Where there is an office use proposed, the applicant may seek a waiver to place a fence rather than a wall pursuant to LDC section 9.2.4(C)(3). 
(4)  All new apartments shall be separated from adjacent single family residential properties by an eight-foot tall brick wall. Stone or a material that duplicates the quality and material of brick or stone, including stucco, split face block, and precast concrete or synthetic walls, may also be used in lieu of brick. If the development borders a lake or conservation area, those sides which front the lake or conservation area shall not require a wall. Right-of-way frontage shall not require a wall unless the rear of the units is facing the street. The applicant may seek a waiver to place a fence rather than a wall pursuant to LDC section 9.2.4(C)(3). 
(5)  Where site conditions allow, the street network of a development shall be designed with internal connectivity and promote external connectivity where feasible. No cul-de-sacs or dead-ends shall be allowed. Where possible, the development shall reconnect interrupted portions of a grid network, or create new connectivity to break up large parcels. 
5.  Intensity of development. The residential density and intensity shall comply with the policies and density limitations set forth in the Comprehensive Plan. Projects that qualify as ONOZ developments are allowed the maximum density and intensity. 
D.  Applicability of other regulations. All building code, housing code and other land use regulations of this Land Development Code are applicable to a development reviewed under this section, except for those permitting special exceptions and variances, and except to the extent that they conflict with a specific provision of this section. Unless otherwise provided in the approved development plan, all land use regulations which apply in relation to a future land use district, including the regulation of signs, shall apply to projects approved under this section. All such land use regulations shall apply in the manner determined by the Community Development Director during the development plan approval process. 
E.  Amendments to approved site development plans. 
1.  An amendment to an approved plan must be reviewed by the city commission, unless consistent with (b) below. All appropriate maps, plans and reports submitted with the approved site development plan may be resubmitted with the petition, along with sufficient new maps, plans and reports to clearly and thoroughly indicate the proposed changes, as the new proposed site development plan. Once a project is accepted under the ONOZ changes to the application will only be considered if those changes are consistent with the intent and requirements of this section. 
2.  Minor amendments to the final plan of an approved ONOZ application may be authorized by the community development director upon a determination that the change would not result in a substantive change to the project, these changes may include, but are not limited to: 
(a)  Minor adjustments or shifts in the location and siting of buildings, structures, solid waste, recycling, and yard trash containers, parking bays and parking spaces, provided any dumpsite is not located closer to any single-family or multiple-family dwelling; 
(b)  Changes in the location of utility tie-ins; 
(c)  Changes in the location and types of landscape materials, excluding changes in location of buffers; 
(d)  Minor changes in the walkway and bikeway systems; 
(e)  The addition of accessory structures or utility buildings of less than 1,000 square feet where there are no major changes to the perimeter features of the development; 
(f)  The addition of up to ten new parking spaces; 
(g)  Modifications which do not entail amendments to specific language included within the Development Order.

(Ord. No. 14-2027, § 1, 10-6-2014; Ord. No. 18-2136 , § 1, 6-18-2018)  
4.4.0. - Protected habitats. 
4.4.1. Applicability. The Longwood Comprehensive Plan Background Document provides a listing of endangered, rare and threatened species and species of special concern that may be found within the City of Longwood. Where such species are known to exist or where habitat that is likely to contain such species exists within the city, the developer shall prepare a critical habitat management plan. 
4.4.2. Requirements for a critical habitat management plan. 
A.  A critical habitat management plan shall include all of the following items: 
1.  A pre-development vegetative cover survey by a professional biologist to identify occurrences of rare, threatened, endangered species, or species of special concern. 
2.  Estimate of land needs to support any significant species on the site. 
3.  Impact of proposed development on the significant species. 
4.  Recommended management plan necessary to protect significant species. 
5.  Where no other alternatives are available, development of no more than 25 percent of a native vegetative community pursuant to design restrictions provided by a qualified biologist will be allowed. 
6.  The use of required open space, setbacks and buffer areas to protect native vegetative communities, wetlands and conservation areas may be accommodated by agreement with the City of Longwood that includes but is not limited to the use of reduced setbacks or buffers, or other valid compromises, as may be proposed by the applicant. 
7.  When construction is proposed to be located on or adjacent to the habitat of endangered or threatened species and native vegetative communities, methods and techniques to protect such areas shall be clearly identified and documented. Such information shall be submitted to the department of community services and approved prior to issuance of a development order. Methods and techniques to be addressed shall include, but may not be limited to, storage and removal of materials, equipment and debris, erosion control, methods to ensure revegetation and/or stabilization of disturbed areas, measures to protect existing natural vegetation and habitat, and methods to prevent pollution of surface waters and groundwater. 
B.  The adequacy of the critical habitat management plan shall be determined by the department of community services in consultation with other appropriate agencies and departments. 
C.  If an adverse effect is unavoidable, the city may require mitigation, or if mitigation is impossible, deny the development order. The final development plan for the site shall conform to the recommendations determined within the critical habitat management plan. 
D.  Development that falls within the jurisdiction of the state department of environmental protection or the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission shall be referred to those agencies, and their appropriate permits shall be obtained prior to the issuance of any development orders by the City of Longwood.  
4.5.0. - Floodplains and flood zones. 
4.5.1. Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose, and objectives. 
A.  The Legislature of the State of Florida has authorized and delegated in F.S. ch. 125 [counties] and F.S. ch. 166 [municipalities], the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Commission of the City of Longwood does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
B.  The flood hazard areas of the City of Longwood are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
C.  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
D.  It is the purpose of this section to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
1.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights and velocities; 
2.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage throughout their intended life span; 
3.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
4.  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
5.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
E.  The objectives of this section are to: 
1.  Protect human life, health and to eliminate or minimize property damage; 
2.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
3.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
4.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
5.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, roadways, and bridges and culverts located in floodplains; 
6.  Maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and 
7.  Ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood hazard area. 
4.5.2. Definitions. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this section shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this ordinance its most reasonable application. 
Accessory structure (appurtenant structure) means a structure that is located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds. 
Appeal means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this ordinance or a request for a variance. 
Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH Zone on the community's flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. This term is synonymous with the phrase "special flood hazard area." 
Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the "100-year flood" and the "regulatory flood"). Base flood is the term used throughout this section. 
Base flood elevation means the water-surface elevation associated with the base flood. 
Basement means that portion of a building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides. 
Building. See structure. 
Datum. A reference surface used to ensure that all elevation records are properly related. Many communities have their own datum that was developed before there was a national standard. The current national datum is the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, which is expressed in relation to mean sea level, or the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988. 
Development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling operations, or storage of materials or equipment. 
Elevated building means a non-basement building built to have the lowest floor elevated above the ground level by foundation walls, posts, piers, columns, pilings, or shear walls. 
Encroachment means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain. 
Existing construction means, for the purposes of floodplain management, structures for which "the start of construction" commenced before March 18, 1980, the date of the initial flood insurance rate map (FIRM). Existing construction, means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the first FIRM (March 18, 1980). This term may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).

A.  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
1.  The overflow of inland or tidal waters. 
2.  The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
3.  Mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by flooding as defined in paragraph (A)2 of this definition and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surface of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the current. 
B.  The collapse or subsidence of land along a shore of a lake or other body of water as the result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in flooding as defined in paragraph (A)1 of this definition. 
Flood insurance rate map (FIRM) means an official map of the community, issued by FEMA, which delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
Flood insurance study (FIS) is the official hydraulic & hydrologic report provided by FEMA. The study contains an examination, evaluation, and determination of flood hazards, and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation, and determination of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) and other flood-related erosion hazards. The study may also contain flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FHBM (where applicable), and other related data and information. 
Floodplain means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of "flooding").

Floodplain administrator is the individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations of the community. 
Floodplain management regulations means this ordinance and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance, and erosion control ordinance), and other applications of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, State of Florida, or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
Floodproofing means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents.

Floodway fringe means that area of the floodplain on either side of the regulatory floodway where encroachment may be permitted without additional hydraulic and/or hydrologic analysis. 
Freeboard means the additional height, usually expressed as a factor of safety in feet, above a flood level for purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for many unknown factors, such as wave action, bridge openings and hydrological effect of urbanization of the watershed, that could contribute to flood heights greater than the height calculated for a selected frequency flood and floodway conditions. 
Functionally dependent use means a use that cannot be used for its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water, such as a docking or port facility necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, shipbuilding or ship repair. The term does not include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities. 
Hardship as related to variances from this ordinance means the exceptional hardship associated with the land that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The community requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.

Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this ordinance, the term is synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, or North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988. 
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 means a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
New construction means, for floodplain management purposes, any structure for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after March 18, 1980, the effective date of the initial floodplain management ordinance based upon specific technical base flood elevation data that established the area of special flood hazard. The term also includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For flood insurance rates, structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after March 18, 1980, the effective date of the date of the initial FIRM and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after March 18, 1980, the effective date of the first floodplain management ordinance. 
North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 means a vertical control used as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain.

Regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
Remedy a deficiency or violation means to bring the regulation, procedure, structure or other development into compliance with State of Florida, federal or local floodplain management regulations; or if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways the impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of this ordinance or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
Riverine means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
Shallow flooding means the same as area of shallow flooding. 
Special flood hazard area means the same as area of special flood hazard. 
Start of construction. For other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act P.

For substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
Structure means for floodplain management purposes a walled and roofed building, including gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual repair work performed. This term does not, however, include any repair or improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of State of Florida or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications, which have been identified by the local code enforcement official prior to the application for permit for improvement, and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions. 
Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance. 
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully complaint with the requirements of this ordinance. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
Watercourse means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur.

All manufactured homes that are placed, or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE, on sites (i) outside of an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, the lowest floor be elevated on a permanent foundation to one foot above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
2.  All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones A-1, AH, and AE, that are not subject to the provisions of paragraph D.1 of this section, must be elevated so that either: 
a.  The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation, or 
b.  The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength that are no less than 48 inches (which includes a one-foot freeboard requirement) in height above the grade and securely anchored to an adequate foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
3.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30. AH, and AE must either: 
a.  Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
b.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions); or 
c.  Meet all the requirements for new construction, including anchoring and elevation requirements in accordance with D.4.a and b of this section. 
4.  Adequate drainage paths around structures shall be provided on slopes to guide water away from structures. 
G.  Standards for streams with established base flood elevations, without regulatory floodways. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 4.5.3.B, where streams exist for which base flood elevation data has been provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency without the delineation of the regulatory floodway (Zones AE and A1-30), the following additional provisions shall also apply. 
1.  Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development including fill shall be permitted within the areas of special flood hazard, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. 
2.  Development activities which increase the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot may be allowed, provided that the developer or applicant first applies, with the community's endorsement, for a conditional FIRM revision, and receives the approval of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
H.  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 4.5.3.B, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and have significant erosion potential, the following additional provisions shall also apply: 
1.  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other developments within the regulatory floodway unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional engineer is provided through hydraulic and hydrologic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice demonstrating that encroachments would not result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
2.  Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes), except in an existing manufactured homes (mobile homes) park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the anchoring standards of section 4.5.5.D.2 and the elevation standards of section 4.5.5.C.1 and 2 and the encroachment standards of section section 4.5.5.F, are met. 
3.  Development activities including new construction and substantial improvements that increase the water surface elevation of the base flood may be allowed, provided that the developer or applicant first applies, with the community's endorsement, for a conditional FIRM revision, and receives the approval of FEMA. 
4.  When fill is proposed, in accordance with the permit issued by the Florida Department of Health, within the regulatory floodway, the development permit shall be issued only upon demonstration by appropriate engineering analyses that the proposed fill will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood in accordance with section 4.5.5.F. 
4.5.6. Specific standards for A-Zones without base flood elevations and regulatory floodways. 
A.  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 4.5.3.B, where there exist A Zones for which no base flood elevation data and regulatory floodway have been provided or designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the following provisions shall apply: 
1.  Require standards of section 4.5.5. 
2.  The floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, State of Florida, or any other source, in order to administer the provisions of this section. When such data is utilized, provisions of section 4.5.5.C shall apply. The floodplain administrator shall: 
a.  Obtain the elevation (in relation to the mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including the basement) of all new and substantially improved structures; 
b.  Obtain, if the structure has been floodproofed in accordance with the requirements of 4.5.5.C, the elevation in relation to the mean sea level to which the structure has been floodproofed; and 
c.  Maintain a record of all such information. 
3.  Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities, the State of Florida, Department of Community Affairs, NFIP Coordinating Office, and the applicable water management district prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit copies of such notifications to FEMA. 
4.  Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained. 
5.  Manufactured homes shall be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. They must be elevated and anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable State of Florida and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
6.  When the data is not available from any source as in paragraph 2 of this section, the lowest floor of the structure shall be elevated to no lower than three feet above the highest adjacent grade. 
7.  Require that all new subdivision proposals and other proposed developments (including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than 50 lots or five aces, whichever is the lesser, include within such proposals base flood elevation data. 
4.5.7. Standards for AO-Zones. 
A.  Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 4.5.5.C, are areas designated as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet, where a clearly defined channel does not exist and the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
1.  All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures in all AO Zones shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the flood insurance rate map. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated to no less than two feet above the highest adjacent grade. 
2.  All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall: 
a.  Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the flood insurance rate map. If no flood depth number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated to at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade, or 
b.  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be completely floodproofed to that level to meet the floodproofing standard specified in section 4.5.5.C.2.

This section is intended to ensure that telecommunication towers that are permitted within the City of Longwood are utilized in a manner that provides for the maximum number of service providers upon each tower within the context of technical feasibility and safety. Further, this section is intended to minimize the number of such towers within the city. Specifically, as a minimum, telecommunications towers exceeding 100 feet in height shall be engineered and constructed so as to accommodate three communication providers. The city shall have the authority to require, specify and otherwise stipulate that telecommunication towers be engineered and constructed in a manner that provides for three collocations as part of the approval processes. As a condition of approval of all telecommunication towers and to the extent that collocation is technically feasible, all owners of existing telecommunication towers shall, upon request of another service provider and for reasonable and agreed upon consideration, permit additional communication service providers upon such existing telecommunication tower. Applicants desiring to construct new telecommunication towers shall submit written documentation that clearly explains the need for and the reasons for the proposed construction of new telecommunication tower rather than locating proposed antenna array/communication equipment upon an existing tower. Such documentation shall include plans of existing and future towers by the applicant/provider in question, correspondence with existing telecommunication tower owners and may include a cost analysis of alternatives. Existing service providers, e.g., existing telecommunication tower owners, that are unwilling, upon request of another service provider, to allow collocation upon such existing tower, shall submit written documentation to the city with reasons and justifications as to why such collocation cannot be accomplished. Competition between service providers shall not be considered to be a valid reason for preventing or otherwise obstructing collocation. The city shall determine whether the applicant and/or existing provider are reasonable and correct in their respective assertions. If the city determines that either party is being unreasonable or otherwise uncooperative, the city shall deny the applicant's request for a new tower and/or the city may cause the existing telecommunication tower's approval to be revoked and said existing tower to be removed. Such determination involving an existing tower owner shall be made in writing and adopted by a majority vote to the city commission upon holding an advertised public hearing and notification of the owner at least 15 days prior to such hearing. Upon adoption of such determination by the city commission, the existing tower owner and the property upon which such tower is located shall be considered to be a violation of the Development Code and shall be subject to any and all remedies and penalties thereof, including but not limited to action pursuant to F.S. ch. 162, or an action at law or in equity requiring removal of the tower and damages, including attorneys fees. 
2.  To minimize adverse visual impacts associated with the proliferation and clustering of telecommunications towers, collocation of communications antennas by more than one carrier on existing or new telecommunication towers shall take precedent over the construction of new single-use telecommunications towers as follows: 
a.  Proposed communications antennas shall collocate onto existing telecommunications towers. 
b.  A telecommunications tower that is reconstructed to accommodate the collocation of an additional communications antenna shall be of a monopole tower type. 
c.  Height. An existing telecommunications tower may be modified or rebuilt to the allowed height including antennas by compliance with this section. 
P.  Certification of compliance with Federal Communication Commission (FCC) NIER Standards. Prior to receiving final inspection by the City of Longwood, documented certification shall be submitted to the FCC, with copy to the city manager, certifying that the telecommunications facility complies with all current FCC regulations, including nonionizing electro-magnetic radiation (NIER). 
Q.  Abandonment. 
1.  In the event the use of any telecommunications tower has been discontinued for a period of 180 consecutive days, the tower shall be deemed to be abandoned. Determination of the date of abandonment shall be made by the city manager who shall have the right to request documentation and/or affidavits from the telecommunications tower owner/operator regarding the issue of tower usage. The telecommunications tower owner/operator shall provide all requested information within ten working days of a request being made, and failure to so provide shall be deemed to constitute 180 days of non-use of the tower. Upon such abandonment, the owner/operator of the tower shall have an additional 90 days within which to: 
a.  Reactivate the use of the tower or transfer the tower to another owner/operator who makes actual use of the tower; or 
b.  Dismantle and remove the tower. With regard to towers that received special exceptional approval, 90 days after dismantling or the expiration of the 270-day period as set forth in this section, the special exception and/or variance for the tower shall automatically expire. 
2.  The City of Longwood, upon abandonment, may require the owner to dismantle the tower at the owner's expense. If the decision is to dismantle the tower, the property shall be cleared of all appurtenances and returned to its natural state at grade level. 
3.  An appropriate surety instrument shall be provided to assure dismantling costs shall be provided by the owner prior to a tower construction permit.

6.1.5. Measurement determinations. 
A.  Distance between signs. The minimum required distance between signs shall be as identified within this Code. 
B.  Façade area. The façade area shall be measured by determining the area within a two-dimensional geometric figure coinciding with the edges of the walls, windows, doors, parapets, marquees, and mansards of greater than 45 degrees that form a side of a building or unit. 
C.  Sign area. 
1.  Generally. The area of a sign shall be the area within the smallest square, rectangle, parallelogram, triangle, circle or semicircle, the sides of which touch the extreme points or edges of the sign face. 
2.  Special situations. 
a.  Where a sign is composed of letters or pictures attached directly to a façade, window, door, or marquee, and the letters or pictures are not enclosed by a border or trimming, the sign area shall be the area within the smallest rectangle, parallelogram, triangle, circle or semicircle, the sides of which touch the extreme points of the letters or pictures as a whole. 
b.  Where four sign faces are arranged in a square, rectangle, or diamond, the area of the sign shall be the area of the two largest faces. 
c.  Where a sign is in the form of a three-dimensional object, the area shall be determined by drawing a square, rectangle, parallelogram, triangle, circle or semicircle, the sides of which touch the extreme points or edges of the projected image of the sign and multiplying that area by two. The "projected image" is that created by tracing the largest possible two-dimensional outline of the sign. 
D.  Number of signs. 
1.  In general, the number of signs shall be the number of noncontiguous sign faces. Multiple noncontiguous sign faces may be counted as a single sign if all the sign faces are included in the geometric figure used for determining the sign area. 
2.  Where two sign faces are placed back to back and are at no point more than two feet apart, it shall be counted as one sign. 
3.  If a sign has four faces arranged in a square, rectangle or diamond, it shall be counted as two signs.

6.1.6. Nonconforming signs. 
A.  Determination of legal nonconformity. Existing signs, excluding off-site signs (see Off-site signs nonconforming this section), that do not conform to the specific provisions of the Code may be eligible for the designation "legal nonconforming" provided that: 
1.  Signs are properly maintained and do not in any way endanger the public. 
2.  The sign was installed in conformance with a valid permit or variance, or complied with all applicable laws on the date of installation. 
B.  Loss of legal nonconforming status. A legal nonconforming sign may lose this designation and become illegal if: 
1.  The sign is relocated or replaced without proper approval. 
2.  The structure or size of the sign is altered in any way except to be brought into full compliance with this ordinance. A building permit shall not be issued for a structural alteration to a nonconforming sign except as allowed for in 6.1.6(C) or if the improvements bring the sign closer to full compliance with the Land Development Code. Where a permit is applied for to bring an existing pole sign or nonconforming monument sign into full compliance with the standards for a monument sign, the sign can continue a nonconformity related to height. This does not refer to change of copy and sign face changes for businesses that have a valid business tax receipt. 
3.  The primary structure to which the sign is accessory is demolished. 
4.  A site plan (major/minor/site plan amendment) is required. 
C.  Maintenance and repair of nonconforming signs. The legal nonconforming sign is subject to all requirements of this Code regarding safety, maintenance, and repair. However, if the sign suffers damage that accounts for a reduction in depreciated value of more than 50 percent, as based on appraisal by a state certified appraiser familiar with the valuation of signs, it must be brought into conformance with this Code or removed.

ARTICLE VII. - CONCURRENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
 
7.1.0. - General provisions. 
7.1.1. Intent. Concurrency is a finding that the public facilities and services necessary to support a proposed development are available, or will be made available, concurrent with the impacts of the development. This article is intended to provide a systematic process for the review and evaluation of all proposed development for its impact on concurrency facilities and services as required by the Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulations Act, F.S. ch. 163, part II, and F.A.C. 9J-5.0055. 
7.1.2. Purpose. The purpose of this article is to ensure that development orders and permits are conditioned on the availability of concurrent facilities which meet adopted level of service requirements established in the City of Longwood Comprehensive Plan. 
7.1.3. Applicability. Unless specifically exempted below, a concurrency determination as provided for in this article, shall be made in conjunction with the following: 
A.  Application for a construction permit pursuant to section 10.1.0. 
B.  Application for approval of a development plan pursuant to section 10.2.0. 
C.  Approval of a preliminary plat pursuant to section 3.3.0. 
7.1.4. Adopted levels of service. The adopted level of service standards for potable water, sanitary sewer, drainage, parks and recreation, solid waste, roadways, and fire and police protection are established in the City of Longwood Comprehensive Plan. 
7.1.5. Cost of studies. The cost of any study necessary to determine the impact of a development on any of the facilities for which level of service standards have been adopted shall be borne by the applicant. 
7.1.6. Planned developments. The city commission may waive requirements in this section related to transportation concurrency through the planned development process until such time as the city implements a state-required mobility strategy. Transportation concurrency requirements may be waived upon sufficient evidence that transportation impacts will be mitigated and multimodal strategies have been integrated. 
(Ord. No. 10-1929, § 1, 9-27-2010)  
7.2.0. - Exemptions. 
7.2.1. Generally. The following development shall be exempt from concurrency review: 
A.  Residential developments which would result in the creation of one single-family dwelling, or one two-family dwelling as well as developments that entail structural alterations to single-family structures which do not change the use of the structure or land. 
B.  Change of use, or expansion, of nonresidential developments of up to ten percent of the existing gross floor area, providing such change of use, or expansion is estimated to generate less than a cumulative 15 percent unit of utility demand. Trip generation data shall be pursuant to the latest edition of the Institute of Traffic Engineers publication, Trip Generation Manual. Multiple expansions of one development shall be cumulative. 
C.  Construction of residential or nonresidential accessory buildings and structures, which do not create additional public facility demand. 
D.  Actions administered through nonimpact development orders as well as other developments which do not increase demand on public facilities, such as grading or excavation of land, or structural alterations which do not include a change of use. 
7.2.2. Vested developments. Developments with valid final development orders prior to July 20, 1992, shall be considered vested and exempt from concurrency management. These development orders shall include the following: 
A.  Any development for which a valid building permit was issued prior to July 20, 1992 and has not expired. 
B.  All vacant lots in single-family detached, single-family attached, and two-family subdivision plats that were platted and recorded prior to November 2, 1992. 
7.2.3. Redevelopment projects. 
A.  If a redevelopment proposal generates demand in excess of 110 percent of the establishment it is replacing, a concurrency review shall be required. However, the concurrency review shall only be directed to the demand generated that exceeds 110 percent of the demand of the prior existing development. 
B.  If the proposed redevelopment generates equal or less demand than the existing development, the applicant for concurrency review shall be given a concurrency credit memorandum within 30 days of the concurrency evaluation that enables the applicant to reserve the unused capacity. The concurrency credit memorandum will expire within three years of its issuance. 
C.  The applicant's submission of an application for a demolition permit shall initiate the concurrency review for the express purpose of issuing credits for redevelopment.  
7.3.0. - Criteria for concurrency. 
7.3.1. Generally. No development approval as set forth in section 7.1.3 shall be granted unless the city finds that capacity for public facilities exists at, or above, the adopted level of service (LOS), or that improvements necessary to bring concurrency facilities up to their adopted LOS will be in place concurrent with the impacts of the development. The city shall find that the following criteria have been met in order for a proposed development to be found in compliance with concurrency management requirements. 
7.3.2. Sanitary sewer, solid waste, drainage, potable water. The concurrency requirements for sanitary sewer, solid waste, drainage, and potable water facilities, may be met by meeting any of the following standards: 
A.  The development approval is granted subject to the condition that at the time of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, or its functional equivalent, the necessary facilities and services are in place and available to serve the new development. 
B.  At the time the development order or permit is issued, the necessary facilities and services are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement to be in place and available to serve new development at the time of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
7.3.3. Parks and recreation. The concurrency requirements for parks and recreational may be met by meeting any of the following standards: 
A.  At the time the development approval is granted, the necessary facilities and services are in place or under actual construction. 
B.  The development approval is issued subject to the condition that at the time of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or its functional equivalent, the acreage for the necessary facilities and services to serve the new development is dedicated or acquired by the local government, or funds in the amount of the developer's fair share are committed; and, 
1.  The development approval is issued subject to the conditions that the necessary facilities and services needed to serve the new development area scheduled to be in place, or under actual construction, not more than one year after issuance of a certificate of occupancy or its functional equivalent, as provided in the City of Longwood five-year schedule of capital improvements; or 
2.  At the time the development approval is issued, the necessary facilities and services are the subject of a binding executed agreement which requires the necessary facilities and services to serve the new development to be in place or under actual construction not more than one year after issuance of a certificate of occupancy or its functional equivalent; or 
3.  At the time the development approval is issued, the necessary facilities and services are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement pursuant to F.S. § 163.3220, or an agreement or development order issued pursuant to F.S. ch. 380, to be in place or under actual construction not more than one year after issuance of a certificate of occupancy or its functional equivalent. 
7.3.4. Roadways. The concurrency requirements for roadways may be met by meeting any of the following standards: 
A.  At the time the development order or permit is issued, the necessary facilities and services are in place or under actual construction. 
B.  A development order or permit is issued subject to the conditions that the necessary facilities and services needed to serve the new development are scheduled to be in place, or under actual construction, not more than three years after issuance of a certificate of occupancy or its functional equivalent, as provided in the City of Longwood five-year schedule of capital improvements, or as provided in the first three years of the applicable adopted Florida Department of Transportation five-year work program. 
C.  At the time a development order or permit is issued, the necessary facilities and services are the subject of a binding executed agreement which requires the necessary facilities and services to serve the new development to be in place or under actual construction no more than three years after the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or its functional equivalent; or 
D.  At the time a development order or permit is issued, the necessary facilities and services are guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement, pursuant to F.S. § 163.3220, to be in place or under actual construction not more than three years after issuance of a certificate of occupancy or its functional equivalent. 
7.3.5. Proportionate fair-share program. 
A.  Purpose and intent. The purpose of this section is to establish a method whereby the impacts of development on transportation facilities can be mitigated by the cooperative efforts of the public and private sectors, to be known as the proportionate fair-share program, as required by and in a manner consistent with F.S. §163.3180(16). 
B.  Applicability. The proportionate fair-share program shall apply to all developments in the city that impact a road segment in the city concurrency management system and have been notified of a failure to achieve transportation concurrency on a roadway segment or segments. The proportionate fair-share program does not apply to developments of regional impact (DRIs) using proportionate share under F.S. §163.3180(12), developments meeting the de minimis standards under F.S. §163.3180(6) or to developments exempted from concurrency as previously provided in section 3.11.1 of this chapter. 
C.  General requirements. 
(1)  An applicant may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirements of the city by making a proportionate fair-share contribution, pursuant to the following requirements: 
(a)  The proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan and applicable land development regulations. 
(b)  The city five-year capital improvement program (CIP) includes a transportation improvement(s) that, upon completion, will accommodate additional traffic generated by the proposed development. 
(2)  The city may choose to allow an applicant to satisfy transportation concurrency through the proportionate fair-share program by contributing to an improvement that, upon completion, will accommodate additional traffic generated by the proposed development but is not contained in the CIP where one of the following apply: 
(a)  The city adds the improvement to the five-year CIP no later than the next regular update. To qualify for consideration under this section, the proposed improvement must be reviewed by the city engineer and must determined to be financially feasible. 
(b)  If the funds in the adopted city five-year CIP are insufficient to fully fund construction of a transportation improvement required by the concurrency management system, the city may require a proportionate fair-share payment for another improvement which will, in the opinion of the city significantly benefit the impacted transportation system. The improvement or improvements funded by the proportionate fair-share component must be adopted into the five-year CIP of the comprehensive plan at the next annual capital improvements element update. 
(3)  Any improvement project proposed to meet the developer's fair-share obligation must meet generally accepted design standards for the State of Florida and the city. 
D.  Application process. 
(1)  Upon notification of a failure to satisfy transportation concurrency, applicants can submit a proposed proportionate fair-share calculation to the city engineer for review. 
(2)  Pursuant to F.S. §163.3180(16)(e) proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation for development impacts to facilities on the strategic intermodal system requires the concurrence of the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT). 
(3)  When a proportionate fair-share calculation is deemed sufficient and eligible, a development order will be prepared between the city and the applicant. The stipulations of the development order shall include but not be limited to the amount of payment, description of work and timing of payment. 
E.  Determining proportionate fair-share obligation. 
(1)  Proportionate fair-share mitigation for concurrency impacts may include, without limitation, separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land, and construction and contribution of facilities. 
(2)  A development shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate fair-share. The fair market value of the proportionate fair-share mitigation for the impacted facilities shall not differ regardless of the method of mitigation. 
(3)  The methodology used to calculate an applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation shall be as provided for in F.S. § 163.3180(12) as follows: 
_____ 
Proportionate Share 	= 	S[[(Development Trips i ) / (SV Increase i )] × Cost i ] 
Where: 		
Development Trips;sub \sub; 	= 	Those trips from the development that are assigned to roadway segment i and have triggered a deficiency per the concurrency management system; 
SV Increase;sub \sub; 	= 	Service volume increase provided by the eligible improvement to roadway segment i per section E; 
Cost;sub \sub; 	= 	Adjusted cost of the improvement to segment i. Cost shall include all improvements and associated costs, such as design, right-of-way acquisition, planning, engineering, inspection, and physical development costs directly associated with construction at the anticipated cost in the year it will be incurred. 
 
_____ 
(4)  For the purposes of determining proportionate share obligations, the city shall determine improvement costs based upon the actual cost of the improvement as obtained from the capital improvements program or another method approved by the city engineer. 
(5)  If the city has accepted right-of-way dedication for all or a portion of the proportionate fair-share payment, credit for the dedication of the non-site related right-of-way shall be valued on the date by appropriate city staff or, at the option of the applicant, by fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the city and at no expense to the city. The applicant shall supply a drawing and legal description of the land and a certificate of title or title search of the land to the city at no expense to the city. If the estimated value of the right-of-way dedication proposed by the applicant is less than the city-estimated total proportionate fair-share obligation for that development, then the applicant must also pay the difference. 
F.  Appropriation of fair-share revenues. 
(1)  Proportionate fair-share revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the city capital improvements program. In the event of a proportionate fair-share mitigation proposal for a transportation facility under the jurisdictional authority of Seminole County or the Florida Department of Transportation, appropriation of funds to capital improvements projects shall be coordinated with the appropriate jurisdiction. 
(2)  In the event a scheduled facility improvement is removed from the CIP, then the revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of another improvement within that same corridor that would mitigate the impacts of development pursuant to the requirements of section C(2)(b). 
G.  Matrix summary of proportionate fair-share program. The following matrix illustrates the proportionate fair-share program as established by this section: 
Transportation Fair-Share Mitigation Program 
Development application submitted 	Concurrency review to determine if street level of service is impacted 	If yes, mitigation is required 	City identifies a project in current 5-year CIP that meets additional demand 	FDOT formula is used to calculate the developer's share in the project 	Developer pays into existing road improvement program 	City constructs project according the 5-year CIP 	End result: Developers contribute to a city planned program of systematic improvements 
  
7.4.0. - Methodology for determining demands on roadways. 
7.4.1. Determination of demand. In determining demand for available capacity for roadways, the following criteria shall be used: 
A.  Residential development. For proposed residential development (except within planned developments), the following trip generation rates shall be used to calculate the impact of the proposed development: 
Land Use Type 	Trips Per Day 
Single-family 	10 
Multiple-family 	8 
 
B.  Nonresidential development. For all other land use categories, the impacts of development shall be measured by utilizing the average daily trip generation rate associated with the land use designation in which the proposed development shall occur, using the most recent published edition of the Institute of Traffic Engineers' Trip Generation Manual. Internal capture rates may be considered in determining traffic volumes for mixed use developments; however, the applicant shall bear the burden of demonstrating any internal capture rates of the total nonresidential trips. 
C.  Other methods and procedures. 
1.  If the preliminary level of service information indicates a deficiency in roadway capacity based on adopted level of service (LOS) standards (described in section 7.4.7), the developer may at his option, prepare a more detailed alternative Highway Capacity Analysis as described in the Highway Capacity Manual (Special Report 209, Transportation Research Board, National Research council, 1985); or conduct a travel time and delay study following professional standards and procedures contained in the Florida Department of Transportation, Traffic Engineering Office in its Manual for Uniform Traffic Studies. 
2.  For all new developments, including new subdivision plats that are anticipated to generate 500 or more trips per day, the developer shall be required to submit a traffic analysis that identifies the development's impact on the city's transportation system. 
3.  The city manager may also require the submission of a traffic analysis for developments that generate less than 500 trips per day if the site location, anticipated total trip generation circulation patterns, or other such factors, warrant a more extensive review of traffic impacts. 
4.  The impact area for the traffic analysis shall include adjacent and connected roadway segments, as determined by the city manager. The applicant may apply alternative trip allocations, together with a statement of trip allocation methodology consistent with professional standards established in one or more of the following documents: 
a.  Highway Capacity Manual, Special Report 209, Transportation Research Board, National Research Council, 1985; 
b.  Florida Highway System Plan, "Traffic Analysis Procedures," Florida Department of Transportation, Bureau of Multi-Modal Systems Planning, 1987; 
c.  Florida Highway System Plan, "Level of Service Standards and Guidelines Manual," Florida Department of Transportation, 1988; 
d.  Trip Generation Manual, Institute of Transportation Engineers (latest edition); or 
e.  Transportation and Land Development, Stover, Virgil G., Institute of Transportation Engineers, 1988. 
5.  If the alternative methodology indicates there is no deficiency in the capacity based on the adopted level of service standard, the results of the alternative methodology will be used. However, the city shall at its discretion reserve the option to have the methodology reviewed by a professional transportation engineer or transportation planner, prior to accepting the methodology. The cost for such review shall be borne by the applicant. 
7.4.2. Traffic analysis. Prior the adoption of the city's mobility strategy as required by F.S. § 163.3180, new development that will have an impact on any transportation systems within the city shall be required to provide an analysis of those impacts along with a strategy to minimize impacts including, but not limited to, developer-funded bike, pedestrian, and transit improvements on and off-site. Improvements are to be made prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or final inspection unless an alternative timeframe is approved by the city commission. The threshold for transportation system impact shall be established in the Longwood Development Code. The traffic analysis shall include the following, unless exempted by the community development director: 
A.  Total projected average weekday trips for the proposed development; 
B.  Pass-by capture rate (commercial land uses only); 
C.  Internal capture rate; 
D.  Daily external trips based on the most recent edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers Trip Generation Manual; and, 
E.  Projected peak hour peak direction vehicle trips on all segments of the arterial and collector street system affected by the development proposal. 
1.  Design capacity of the accessed road(s); 
2.  Analysis of traffic distribution on the road network, including all links impacted by more than ten percent of development traffic or 500 trips per day, whichever is greater. The trip distribution shall be consistent with the "presets" contained in the approved trip generation model; 
3.  Necessary operational improvements to the city, county, or state maintained transportation system, in order to maintain the appropriate level of service for the roadway; 
4.  Justification, including appropriate references for the use of any trip generation rates, adjustment factors or traffic assignment methods not previously approved by the city; 
5.  The latest edition of the ITE Trip "Generation Manual shall be used to calculate these estimates. Adjustments to these estimates may be made based on special trip generation information supplied by the applicant; and 
6.  Other related information as required by the city.

7.5.0. - Concurrency review process. 
7.5.1. Generally. 
A.  Responsibility of city manager. The city manager shall be responsible for the administration of the concurrency management system. No final development order shall be issued for any development subject to the requirements of this article unless it meets the conditions stated herein. 
B.  Annual status report. The city manager shall, at least annually, present a concurrency management status report to the land planning agency in sufficient time to allow its review and recommendation to the city commission for preparation of the city's capital improvement element and budget. 
C.  Traffic counts. The city manager shall, at least annually, publish the annual average daily vehicle trips counts for the arterial and collector roadway segments affecting the city. Said traffic counts may also be collected and published for local streets as the need warrants. 
7.5.2. Procedures. 
A.  Application. 
1.  All applicants for developments subject to a concurrency review shall make application in the manner and form described by the City of Longwood, and shall at a minimum include the proposed use, its density or intensity and anticipated completion date. 
2.  No application for concurrency review will be considered unless the proposed development is consistent with the land use designation on the FLUM. 
B.  Development assessment. The review of concurrency applications shall be based on the best available information. The information provided in the concurrency application shall be assumed to be correct and shall be relied on for the assessment. 
C.  Concurrency determination. The city manager shall provide the applicant with a written determination concerning the proposed development no later than 30 days after submission of the complete application. 
1.  Identifying the available capacity of each facility; 
2.  Identifying any facility deficiencies; 
3.  Identifying the improvements required for a deficient facility to meet the adopted level of service standards; and 
4.  Other such findings as may be pertinent to the specific development. 
D.  Certificate of concurrency. 
1.  If the city manager finds that the development may be constructed without causing a reduction in any level of service established in the comprehensive plan, a certificate of concurrency shall be issued. 
2.  If construction of the development does not substantially commence within one-year of the date of issuance of the certificate of concurrency, the certificate shall lapse and a new concurrency determination must be made for the development. 
3.  Once development commences, it shall proceed to completion in accord with the authorizing development order. If construction of the development ceases for a period of 180 consecutive days or the permit is revoked, the certificate of concurrency shall lapse, and a new concurrency determination must be made before the development may be completed. 
E.  Concurrency resolution. If the concurrency review determines that the proposed development will result in a reduction of service below any established level of service standard contained in the comprehensive plan, the city and the applicant may enter into a development agreement guaranteeing adequate facilities and services pursuant to the provisions of section 7.3.0.

ARTICLE IX. - HARDSHIP RELIEF AND SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 12-1992, § 1, adopted Sept. 4, 2012, changed the title of Art. IX from "Hardship Relief" to "Hardship Relief and Special Exceptions." 
 
9.0.0. - Purpose. 
The purpose of this article is to provide mechanisms for obtaining relief from the provisions of this development code where hardship would otherwise occur and to provide for special exceptions. Two forms of hardship are addressed: (1) section 9.1.0 addresses hardship that would be caused if nonconforming uses or structures were required to immediately come into compliance with this development code; and (2) section 9.2.0 addresses the hardship that may be caused in particular cases by the imposition of the Development Code's development design standards. Section 9.3.0 allows for special exceptions in situations where the resulting development will provide for an equal or better outcome, where there is not a determination of hardship. 
(Ord. No. 10-1914, § 2, 3-1-2010; Ord. No. 12-1992, § 1, 9-4-2012)  
9.1.0. - Noncomforming uses/structures. 
9.1.1. Nonconforming uses. Non-conforming uses shall mean and refer to those uses of real property and the characteristics of such uses that were lawful prior to the adoption of the Longwood Development Code or any subsequent amendments thereto, but are, at present, prohibited or otherwise further restricted under the current Longwood Development Code. The intent of this section is to permit, but not encourage, such non-conforming uses to continue until such uses are removed as required by this section. A nonconforming use may continue so long as such use remains lawful outside the context of the Longwood Development Code and compliance with the following provisions is maintained: 
1.  Enlargement increase, intensification, alteration. A nonconforming use shall not be enlarged, intensified, increased, or extended to occupy a greater area of land or water than was occupied at the time of the city's adoption or amendment of the applicable Longwood Development Code prohibition, regulation, or restriction. This section shall not be interpreted to prohibit a nonconforming use from being reduced in intensity, size or scope; however, once such nonconforming use is reduced, intensification or reexpansion beyond such reduced scope shall not be permitted beyond what is currently provided for in the Longwood Development Code, the ultimate goal of this section being to phase out nonconforming uses over time. 
2.  Relocation. A nonconforming use shall not be moved or otherwise relocated, in whole or in part, to any portion of a lot or parcel other than that which was occupied by such use at the time of the city's adoption or amendment of the applicable Longwood Development Code prohibition, regulation, or restriction. 
3.  Discontinuance. A non-conforming use shall be deemed abandoned and become an illegal use subject to all extant provisions of the Longwood Development Code if such use is discontinued or otherwise lapses for a period of 365 days or more. Discontinuance shall be determined by any of the following: if the business relocates, if there is an interruption in utility service, a failure to pay applicable business taxes or the expiration of a business tax receipt, the absence of signage indicating the existence of the nonconforming use on the property, or any other relevant evidence indicating discontinuation of the nonconforming use for the requisite time period. In determining the date of discontinuance, the date of the first indication of abandonment shall be relied upon. A nonconforming use shall also be considered to be abandoned if a legal use moves in. For the following uses, the time period for which discontinuance is determined is 90 days: 
a.  Pawn shops. 
b.  Tattoo parlors. 
c.  Massage therapy establishments. 
d.  Vehicle sales facilities (LDC 5.4.3) 
4.  Subdivision and additional structures. No real property upon which a nonconforming use currently exists shall be subdivided, nor shall any structures be added to such property, except for those purposes and in a manner conforming to all provisions of the Longwood Development Code for the district in which the property is located. 
5.  Change in tenancy or ownership. There may be a change in tenancy, ownership or management of a nonconforming use, provided there is no change in the nature, character, or intensity of the nonconforming use. 
(Ord. No. 11-1961, § 1, 5-16-2011; Ord. No. 11-1976, § 1, 11-7-2011; Ord. No. 16-2088 , § 1, 6-20-2016) 
9.1.2. Nonconforming structures. Nonconforming structures shall mean and refer to lots, structures or elements of a structure, including, but not limited to, siding materials, roof types, fences, façades or façade treatments that were lawful prior to the adoption of the Longwood Development Code or any amendments thereto, but are, at present, prohibited or otherwise further regulated or restricted under the terms of the current Longwood Development Code. The intent of this section is to permit, but not encourage, such nonconforming structures to continue until such structures are removed as required by this section. A nonconforming structure may be continued so long as such structure remains otherwise lawful outside the context of the Longwood Development Code and compliance with the following provisions is maintained: 
1.  Destruction. A nonconforming structure that is destroyed or demolished by any means so as to require substantial improvements) shall not be reconstructed unless such structure is constructed or otherwise reconstructed in conformity with all extant provisions of the Longwood Development Code. For the purposes of this section 9.0.0 and all subsections thereunder, "substantial improvement" shall mean and refer to any repair, reconstruction, renovation, rehabilitation, addition, expansion, or other improvement of a structure, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the fair market value of the structure either at the time just before the commencement of such improvement; or, if the structure has been damaged and is being restored, at the time just before the damage occurred. Fair market value shall be determined for the year in which a substantial improvement is commenced by reference to the official tax assessment rolls for that year or by an appraisal by a qualified independent appraiser. The extent of any such damage shall be determined by the building official, in consultation with the community development director, by comparing the estimated cost of repairs or restoration with the fair market value. The cost of repeated improvements to a nonconforming structure, which improvements are implemented incrementally over any period of time since the effective date of this development code, shall be combined to determine whether the substantial improvement threshold has been reached. 
2.  Enlargement or extensions to nonconforming structures. Nonconforming structures used in a manner conforming to the provisions of the Longwood Development Code may be enlarged or extended without regard to substantial improvement thresholds, provided that such enlargement or extension does not aggravate, increase or exacerbate an existing structural nonconformity. 
(Ord. No. 18-2136 , § 3, 6-18-2018) 
9.1.3. Repeated expansions of a development, constructed over any period of time commencing with the effective date of this development code, shall be combined in determining whether this threshold has been reached. 
Special provisions for nonconforming stormwater management facilities. An existing development that does not comply with the stormwater management requirements of this Code must be brought into fall compliance when the use of the development is intensified, resulting in an increase in stormwater runoff or added concentration of pollution in the runoff. 
9.1.4. Special provisions for nonconforming lots of record. 
1.  On lots of record as of the date of adoption of this development code or any amendments thereto, which lots are inconsistent with the requirements as to lot area, lot width, or both, and which lots are designated as LDR in the future land use element, a single-family residence and accessory structures may be constructed in accord with all other site development standards in this development code. 
2.  On lots of record as of the date of adoption of this development code, which lots are inconsistent with the requirements as to lot area, lot width, or both, and which lots are designated as MDR in the future land use element, a single-family residence or residential duplex and accessory structures may be constructed in accord with all other site development standards in this development code. 
3.  Nonconforming lots of record may not be built upon except as set forth in [subsections] 1 and 2 above. 
(Ord. No. 11-1961, § 1, 5-16-2011) 
9.1.5. Special provisions for nonconforming parking lot design, landscaping, lighting, access and buffers . Properties that do not conform to parking, landscaping, lighting, access, and buffer requirements of this Development Code shall be brought into compliance with such provisions whenever site plan approval is required, a substantial improvement or change of use is proposed, or when the use on the site is discontinued or otherwise lapses for a period of 365 days or more. Discontinuance shall be determined by any of the following: if the business relocates, if there is an interruption in utility service, a failure to pay applicable business taxes or the expiration of a business tax receipt, the absence of signage indicating the existence of the use on the property, or any other relevant evidence indicating the intent to discontinue the use. In determining the date of discontinuance, the date of the first indication of abandonment shall be relied upon. If such compliance is physically impossible due to the size of a site or the physical layout of structures on or adjoining the site, the property shall nonetheless be brought into compliance to the maximum extent practicable as determined by the community development director. If a proposed use increases the amount of required parking spaces in a manner that the site cannot support, and the increased parking demand cannot be mitigated as described in article III, the maximum extent practicable language does not apply.

A.  Granted by board of adjustment. The board of adjustment may grant a variance from the strict application of any provision of this Code, except provisions in article II (Land Use), section 6.1.6 (Nonconforming signs) and article VII (Concurrency Management), article IX (Hardship Relief), and article X (Administration) if the following procedures are followed and findings made. 
B.  Procedure. The procedures established in article X of this Code for review of application for variances shall be followed. 
(Ord. No. 10-1929, § 1, 9-27-2010; Ord. No. 11-1976, § 1, 11-7-2011) 
9.2.2. Limitations on granting variances. 
A.  Initial determination. The board of adjustment shall first determine whether the need for the proposed variance arises out of the physical surroundings, shape, topographical condition, or other physical or environmental conditions that are unique to the specific property involved. If so, the board shall make the following required findings based on the granting of the variance for that site alone. If, however, the condition is common to numerous sites so that requests for similar variances are likely to be received, the board shall make the required findings based on the cumulative effect of granting the variance to all who may apply. 
B.  Required findings. The board of adjustment shall not vary the requirements of any provision of this development code unless it makes a positive finding, based on substantial competent evidence, on each of the following: 
1.  There are practical or economic difficulties in carrying out the strict letter of the regulation. 
2.  The variance request is not based exclusively upon a desire to reduce the cost of developing the site. 
3.  The proposed variance will not substantially increase congestion on surrounding public streets, the danger of fire, or other hazard to the public. 
4.  The proposed variance will not substantially diminish property values in, nor alter the essential character of, the area surrounding the site. 
5.  The effect of the proposed variance is in harmony with the general intent of this development code and the specific intent of the relevant subject area(s) of the development code. 
C.  Imposition of conditions. In granting a variance, the board of adjustment may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a variance as may be necessary to allow a positive finding to be made on any of the foregoing factors, or to minimize the injurious effect of the variance. 
D.  Self-imposed hardships. Any structure that is placed improperly on the property without a permit is not eligible to apply for a variance. A property that is subject to a current code violation may not apply for a variance until the violation is resolved. 
E.  Historic district variances. In the event of a variance request to any of the regulations defined in the Longwood Historic District Code Book for either contributing or supporting structures, the city commission shall hold a hearing on the variance pursuant to the procedures in section 10.13.0 of this article to determine whether request is consistent with the required findings of LDC 9.2.2.B. 
F.  Expiration. A granted variance shall expire one year after the date of the board of adjustment or city commission decision, unless such variance is included as part of a site plan or construction permit that is approved during this one year period, at which point the variance is valid for the duration of the site plan or construction permit, whichever is longer. 
(Ord. No. 10-1929, § 1, 9-27-2010; Ord. No. 11-1961, § 1, 5-16-2011; Ord. No. 11-1976, § 1, 11-7-2011) 
9.2.3. Special provisions where a variance to the requirements of the flood damage prevention regulations. 
A.  Additional finding. In addition to the findings required above, the board of adjustment shall find that the requested variance will not result in an increase in the elevation of the base flood, additional threats to public safety, additional public expense, the creation of nuisances, fraud or victimization of the public, or conflicts with other local ordinances. 
B.  Considerations. Before granting a variance from the flood damage prevention regulations, the board of adjustment shall consider: 
1.  The danger that materials may be swept from the site onto other lands. 
2.  The danger to life and property from flooding or erosion. 
3.  The potential of the proposed facility and its contents to cause flood damage and the effect of that damage on the owner and the public. 
4.  The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community, and whether it is a functionally dependent facility. 
5.  The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or erosion, for the proposed use. 
6.  The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated neighboring development. 
7.  The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area. 
8.  Safe vehicular access to the property in times of flood. 
9.  The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and effects of wave action, if applicable, at the site. 
10.  The costs of providing governmental services during and after floods including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities. 
C.  Notification. All variances to the flood damage prevention regulations shall: 
1.  Specify the difference between the flood protection elevation and the elevation to which the structure is to be built. 
2.  State that the variance will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance. 
3.  State that construction below the flood protection level increases risks to life and property. 
D.  Record of variances to be maintained. The director shall maintain a record of all variances including the justification for their issuance and a copy of the notice of the variance. The director shall report all variances in the annual or biannual report to the city manager. 
E.  Historic properties. Notwithstanding the foregoing requirements, special variances may be granted for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on, or classified as contributing to a district listed on, the National Register of Historic Places, the local register of historic places, or the state inventory of historic places. The special variance shall be the minimum necessary to protect the historic character and design of the structure. No special variance shall be granted if the proposed construction, rehabilitation, or restoration will cause the structure to lose its historical designation. 
9.2.4. Administrative waivers. 
A.  Applicability. Site design requirements may be modified by the community development director, subject to the criteria in this section 9.2.4. 
B.  Eligibility. The community development director shall consider the following criteria to determine whether a waiver request shall be approved: 
1.  The situation giving rise to the need for waiver is preexisting and was created by the original plat or by the street location; the existence of the situation creates practical difficulties for development. 
2.  There are existing trees or other natural areas that will be damaged or destroyed in order to meet the site design criteria. 
3.  There are preexisting, unique physical characteristics of the development site that create practical difficulties for development. 
4.  The waiver will better enable the site to accommodate multimodal facilities. 
5.  The waiver will allow for a more energy-efficient project design. 
6.  The waiver allows the development to better incorporate existing buildings, trees, topographic features, or other existing elements. 
7.  The waiver allows for the provision of urban open space, seating, fountains, accent landscaping, or other similar urban pedestrian amenities. 
8.  The waiver allows for an opportunity to promote compact and walkable development patterns. 
C.  Waivers. 
1.  Waivers of up to 20 percent may be granted to any numeric site design standard by the community development director. This amount may be increased to 25 percent with the concurrence of the city manager. No waivers can be granted to the Comprehensive Plan. 
2.  Waivers to the impervious surface ratio up to 20 percent may be granted by the community development director. This amount may be increased to 25 percent with the concurrence of the city manager. In this instance, a professional engineer will need to provide documentation along with a signed and sealed determination that the waiver will not create a significant negative impact on drainage. 
3.  Where the Code requires a wall between multi-family residential or an office use and properties with the future land use of LDR and MDR, and where the waiver request is consistent with subsection B.2. above, the community development director may approve a waiver based on the following criteria: 
a.  The applicant shall send a notice consistent with LDC section 10.0.6 to all adjacent property owners describing the proposal and asking the adjacent property owners to express any objection to the city. 
b.  To place a fence with landscaping where a wall is required by the LDC, the applicant must demonstrate, through a letter provided by a certified arborist or landscape architect, that the installation of the wall will directly necessitate the removal of a tree over 40 inches DBH. The tree must not be on the Prohibited Species list in LDC section 3.5.5, and must be determined to be in a healthy, non-declining state by the arborist or landscape architect. 
c.  Where such a waiver is granted, if the tree is proposed for removal at any point in the future, the tree removal permit shall be for the total cost of removing a healthy tree regardless of the current condition of the tree, and a contribution shall be made to the tree fund. 
d.  Where such a waiver is granted, the applicant may place a fence made of vinyl, wood, or similar (excluding chain link) that shall be separated from the adjacent property by a site condition appropriate buffer. 
e.  The community development director may also approve a waiver where the owner of the property (or the president of the HOA or similar entity, where applicable) and the property owner both desire not to see a perimeter wall built. Both parties may sign an agreement acceptable to the city that allows a fence, landscape buffer, or no buffer at all between the two properties. 
D.  Procedure. 
1.  Proposed waiver must be clearly identified on the site plan and listed in an accompanying explanation. The written explanation should identify the applicable code requirement, the justification for the waiver, and the amount of waiver requested. 
2.  In approving the site plan, the community development director shall specifically note the waivers that are granted. 
3.  Should the community development director determine that the impacts of the exception have the potential for a significant negative impact on surrounding property owners, notice by certified mail or proof of mailing shall be provided to all adjacent property owners or all property owners within 300 feet of any boundary of the subject parcel as shown on the Seminole County Property Appraiser records—whichever is deemed appropriate by the Director—and any property owners' association registered with the department that falls within the notice boundaries. 
4.  Where notice is required, the community development director shall make no decision regarding the waiver until after the applicant provides sufficient documentation that all applicable property owners have been notified and given sufficient time to respond. 
5.  In granting a waiver, the community development director may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a waiver as may be necessary to allow a positive finding to be made on any of the factors set forth in section 9.2.4(B) of this Code, or to minimize the injurious effect of the waiver. 
6.  Any structure that is placed improperly on the property without a permit is not eligible to apply for a waiver. A property that is subject to a current code violation may not apply for a waiver until the violation is resolved. 
7.  A granted waiver shall expire one year after the date of the community development director's decision, unless such waiver is included as part of a site plan or construction permit that is approved during this one-year period, at which point the waiver is valid for the duration of the site plan or construction permit, whichever is longer. 
(Ord. No. 10-1929, § 1, 9-27-2010; Ord. No. 11-1976, § 1, 11-7-2011; Ord. No. 13-2016, § 1, 11-18-2013; Ord. No. 14-2049 , § 1, 4-20-2015; Ord. No. 16-2107 , § 1, 2-6-2017; Ord. No. 18-2136 , § 3, 6-18-2018) 
9.2.5. Hardship—Eminent domain takings. 
A.  Intent. This section is intended to provide a fair and equitable process whereby either landowners affected by the transfer of any part of such property to an entity having the power of eminent domain, or such landowners jointly with the condemning authority, can rehabilitate, or mitigate damage to, the remaining parcel, and the condemning authority can independently obtain nonbinding determinations, where such remaining parcel deviates from the LDC and/or any applicable subdivision and/or site plans), and/or developer or annexation agreements with the city that may result from such transfer. 
B.  Definitions. 
1.  For the purposes of this section and this section only, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 
i.  "Transfer in satisfaction of condemnation ("TSC")" shall mean and refer to a transfer of an interest in real property to an entity having the power of eminent domain, whether such transfer be effected by final judgment in a condemnation action, certificate of deposit pursuant to an order of taking, deed under threat of condemnation, voluntary transfer, or otherwise. 
ii.  "Director" shall mean and refer to the City of Longwood Director of Community Development or his/her designee. 
iii.  "Remaining parcel" shall mean and refer to the remaining portion of real property, including existing improvements, after a portion of such property is transferred to an entity having the power of eminent domain. 
iv.  "Governing documents" shall mean and refer to those site and/or subdivision plans and/or agreements and/or city zoning/development approvals, including but not limited to developer or annexation agreements, which are applicable to or otherwise enforceable against a particular property or development. Such documents, when submitted to the city for approval, shall be fully engineered and meet any requirements of the LDC applicable to such documents unless otherwise stated herein. 
v.  "Nonbinding" shall mean and refer to determinations by the city that do not require the owner of a remaining parcel to comply with the city's determinations. 
C.  Taking or transfer causing nonconformance of remaining property. 
1.  Notwithstanding any provision of the LDC to the contrary, whenever a transfer in satisfaction of condemnation ("TSC") occurs, and such transfer causes the remaining parcel to deviate from the LDC and/or governing documents applicable to such property, then such remaining parcel shall thereafter be an illegal site and/or structure to the extent that the TSC causes the remaining parcel to deviate from the LDC and/or governing documents. 
2.  (a)  Within 90 days after the date of the TSC, the owner of the remaining parcel must schedule and participate in a pre-application conference with the director to discuss the actions or improvements necessary to bring such remaining parcel into compliance with the LDC and governing documents. Such 90-day period shall constitute a "grace period" during which code enforcement action against the remaining parcel, with respect only to those deviations caused by the TSC, shall be temporarily suspended to facilitate operation of this section. An application made within such 90-day period shall extend such "grace period" pending the owner's good faith participation in the rehabilitation process pursuant to this section. A property owner may still apply for relief pursuant to this section after the expiration of the 90-day period, at which time, pending code enforcement action against deviations caused by the TSC shall be abated pending the owner's good faith participation in the rehabilitation process pursuant to this section. 
(b)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit or otherwise abate code enforcement action against a remaining parcel for: (1) deviations or violations not caused by a TSC or (2) deviations or violations, regardless of whether such are caused by a TSC, that pose a threat of imminent harm or danger to the health, safety, and welfare of the community, including, but not limited to, nuisances, environmental hazards, or other hazardous conditions. 
3.  Within 180 days after the date of the TSC, the owner of the remaining parcel must propose and submit to the director an application for relief pursuant to this section accompanied by proposed amendments and revisions to the governing documents currently in effect, outlining a plan to correct the deviations from the LDC and governing documents that are caused by the TSC. Such proposed amendments and revisions shall account for the effect of the TSC and propose a plan to bring those portions of the remaining parcel, which the TSC has caused to deviate from the LDC and governing documents, into compliance with all requirements of the LDC, including, but not limited to, any applicable landscape buffers, stormwater requirements, setback requirements, landscaping requirements, signage requirements, and parking requirements. To be considered by the director, the foregoing documentation must be submitted together with appropriate application forms, as well as payment for any application fees, pursuant to the requirements of section 10.0.5(B). 
4.  Following submittal of such application, the owner of the remaining parcel must continue in good faith with the processing of the application and the proposed revisions and amendments to the governing documents and respond to city staff comments within 30 days of receiving any such comments. 
5.  Following the city commission's approval of the proposed amendments and revisions to the governing documents, the owner must proceed in good faith to bring the remaining parcel into compliance with any such revised or amended governing documents. The city commission or the director shall approve a specific timeline for completion of site improvements required by any such revised governing documents, which shall be tailored to account for the complexity of the required improvements as well as any special conditions pertaining to the rehabilitation of the remaining parcel. Following timely completion of the site improvements required by any of the revised governing documents approved by the city commission, the remaining parcel shall thereafter be deemed to be conforming as it relates to the matters addressed in such documents. 
6.  The city commission may, at its option, require the execution of a new development agreement in connection with the approval of any revised governing documents or amendments thereto. Any new agreements or amendments to existing development or annexation agreements must be approved by the city commission and be executed by the city officials having authority over such matters. 
7.  Unless otherwise stated herein, all review procedures and requirements contained in the LDC that pertain to particular types of governing documents shall be equally applicable to the revised versions of such governing documents that are submitted by an owner pursuant to this section, except that no public hearings shall be required other than those required by state law. 
D.  Waivers. 
1.  If, due to the TSC, bringing the remaining parcel into conformity with the LDC and/or the governing documents would place an unreasonable burden upon the property owner, then the property owner may seek applicable waivers or exceptions from the LDC and proposed revisions or amendments to the governing documents as part of the owner's application. In determining whether bringing a particular parcel of property into conformity with the LDC and the newly approved governing documents would place an unreasonable burden upon the owner of the remaining property, the city commission must consider the following factors: 
i.  Physical constraints imposed based upon the size, shape, or usable area of the remaining parcel and existing structures located thereon; 
ii.  Safety concerns that would be created by strict adherence to the LDC; 
iii.  Factors and circumstances that preclude the continued use of the remaining parcel with the uses actually occurring on the property immediately prior to the TSC; 
iv.  The effects of the proposed waiver or exception on traffic congestion on the surrounding public streets and the danger of fire or other hazard to the public; 
v.  Whether the effect of the proposed waiver or exception is in harmony with the general intent of the city's LDC and the specific intent of any and all relevant subject areas of such code. 
2.  In connection with the approval of any revised governing documents, the city commission may grant waivers or exceptions from the provisions of the LDC upon finding that an unreasonable burden would otherwise be placed on the property owner in accordance with the criteria set forth in section 9.2.4(D)(1) of this Code. 
3.  In granting a waiver or exception, the city commission may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the remaining parcel benefited by a waiver or exception as may be necessary to allow a positive finding to be made on any of the factors set forth in section 9.2.4(D)(1) of this Code, or to minimize the injurious effect of the waiver or exception. 
4.  Regardless of whether bringing the remaining parcel into conformity with the LDC and/or the governing documents would place an unreasonable burden upon the property owner, if a TSC causes a remaining parcel to deviate from the LDC to such a degree that the granting of waivers and exceptions would not permit the general intent of the city's LDC and the specific intent of any and all relevant subject areas of such Code to be met, the city commission may refuse to grant any such waivers and exceptions. 
E.  Actions taken prior to transfer in satisfaction of condemnation. 
1.  Prior to the occurrence of the TSC, a property owner may, at his/her option: 
i.  Hold the preapplication conference with the director and submit such application and proposed revisions or amendments to the governing documents to such director; 
ii.  Apply for waivers or exceptions as set forth in subsection "D" supra; and/or 
iii.  Obtain approvals pursuant to such application to address the conditions that are expected to exist following the TSC. 
2.  At any time prior to a TSC, the condemning authority may apply to the director for a written, non-binding determination as to whether one or more specifically detailed "cure plans," waivers, or exceptions proposed by such condemning authority will likely satisfy the requirements of this section. Prior to submitting any such application, the condemning authority shall hold a pre-application conference with the director. 
3.  Following a condemning authority's pre-application conference with the director, the condemning authority may submit an application for a written, non-binding determination as described above. Such application shall include the information requested by the director at the pre-application conference. Any cure plan specified in the application must clearly depict and describe the existing condition of the affected property prior to the TSC and the predicted condition of the affected property following the TSC and the completion of the site improvements proposed by the cure plan. 
4.  The issuance of a non-binding determination by the director or city commission pursuant to this section shall not preclude the director or the city commission from approving a competing application from the owner of the remaining parcel, which differs from the cure plan, waivers and exceptions addressed in the non-binding determination, it being recognized that there may be more than one alternative approach to cure the effects of a TSC that would bring the remaining parcel into conformity with the governing documents and the city's code requirements. 
5.  In the event a condemning authority obtains a non-binding determination concerning a cure plan, waiver, or exception pursuant to this Section, such shall only become binding upon the remaining parcel to the extent such cure plan, waiver, or exception has been approved by the city commission and is incorporated into a written settlement of the TSC between the owner of the remaining parcel and the condemning authority. If more than one determination concerning a cure plan, waiver or exception is approved by the city commission any of the determinations that are approved by the city commission may be used and relied upon by the owner of the remaining parcel to rehabilitate such parcel. 
F.  Fees. 
1.  Anyone submitting an application pursuant to this section shall be responsible for all of the city's review costs associated with the submittal of such application, any revised governing documents, and any proposed cure plans submitted in conjunction therewith. 
2.  The fees for the submission of a revised, fully engineered site plan are the same as those for an initial site plan as set forth in Appendix B of this LDC. 
G.  Enforcement. The city may enforce violations of this section by way of code enforcement board actions, revocation of any certificates of occupancy related to the subject property, and/or all other remedies available to the city in law or equity. Prior to enforcing a violation of this section, the city shall provide written notice of such violation to the applicable property owner, requiring such owner to cure such violation. 
H.  Notice. If a condemning authority or owner of a remaining parcel seeks city approval of a cure plan, waiver, or exception, the party seeking such relief shall provide to the other party written notice of such application at the time of submittal of the application and at least ten days notice of the hearing(s) before the city commission related to the action. 
(Ord. No. 09-1891, § II, 5-18-2009; Ord. No. 10-1929, § 1, 9-27-2010; Ord. No. 18-2136 , § 3, 6-18-2018)  
9.3.0. - Special exceptions. 
9.3.1. Special exceptions. In those circumstances where the applicant believes that, due to unique characteristics of the site or other special circumstances, strict compliance with the Code is not feasible or desirable and that deviation from the Code will allow for equal or better results, the city commission may be petitioned to grant a special exception to the Longwood Development Code relative to the specific provision(s) in question. The applicant shall petition the commission by completing an application provided by the community development department and paying a fee as established by the city commission. 
(Ord. No. 12-1992, § 1, 9-4-2012; Ord. No. 18-2136 , § 3, 6-18-2018) 
9.3.2. Application process. The applicant shall provide an application on forms provided by the community development department and with a fee established by the city commission, describing the special exception request and how the special request addresses the criteria listed in section 9.3.3. Prior to review of the application by the city commission, each applicable member of the development review team (DRT) shall make a written recommendation for approval, approval with conditions, or denial of plans based on application of their particular code. It shall be the responsibility of the CDSD, or the director's designee, to collect the comments of the DRT and prepare a written staff analysis of the outstanding issues related to each application and recommendation for approval, approval with conditions or denial to the city commission. 
(Ord. No. 12-1992, § 1, 9-4-2012; Ord. No. 18-2136 , § 3, 6-18-2018) 
9.3.3. Criteria. The city commission may grant a special exception from the strict application of any provision of this Code, except provisions in article II (Land Use Districts and Overlay Districts), LDC 5.4.0 (Supplemental standards for specified land use activities), Section 6.1.6 (Nonconforming signs), Article VII (Concurrency Management), Article IX (Hardship Relief), and Article X (Administration) and 12.1.3 (Heritage Village Table of Allowable Uses) if the following procedures are followed and findings made. The city commission shall consider the following criteria when making their determination: 
1.  The request is consistent with the spirit and intent of the Code; 
2.  The resulting development will provide equal or better results than required by the Code; 
3.  That the resulting development is consistent with the city's comprehensive plan and other city adopted planning documents; 
4.  That the granting of the special exception will not diminish property values of the area surrounding the site; 
5.  That the request represents the minimum modification(s) necessary and is not primarily driven by a desire to reduce costs on the project; and 
6.  If the condition resulting for the request for a special exception is common to numerous sites, so that the request for similar special exceptions are likely to be received, the cumulative impacts of granting the request. 
(Ord. No. 12-1992, § 1, 9-4-2012; Ord. No. 16-2088 , § 1, 6-20-2016; Ord. No. 16-2107 , § 1, 2-6-2017) 
9.3.4. Commission review. The city commission shall hold a public hearing to consider all requests for special exceptions to the Code. At least ten days prior to the hearing date, notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published in the official newspaper of the City of Longwood. The applicant shall send written notice of the public hearing by certified mail or proof of mailing to all owners of real property located within the area to be considered for the special exception and to all owners of real property located within 200 feet of the area for which the special exception is requested. For special exceptions in the Historic District, all property owners in the District shall be notified. Such notice shall be given not less than ten days prior to the date set for the public hearing by posting such notice, properly addressed and postage-paid to each owner of record as it appears on the most recently approved tax roll. The applicant is responsible for all costs and fees associated with such notification. 
In granting an application for special exception, the city commission may impose such conditions and restrictions upon the site benefitted by the special exception as may be necessary to minimize the injurious effect of the special exception or to make the special exception more consistent with the spirit and intent of the Code. After conducting the public hearing and considering the criteria of section 9.3.3, the city commission may approve, approve with conditions, or deny the special exception application based on competent, substantial evidence in the record. 
(Ord. No. 12-1992, § 1, 9-4-2012; Ord. No. 14-2025, § 1, 5-5-2014; Ord. No. 14-2049 , § 1, 4-20-2015; Ord. No. 16-2088 , § 1, 6-20-2016) 
9.3.5. Appeals. All decisions of the city commission concerning special exceptions shall be final. 
(Ord. No. 12-1992, § 1, 9-4-2012) 
9.3.6. Expiration of special exceptions. A granted special exception shall expire one year after the date of the city commission decision, unless such special exception is included as part of a site plan or construction permit that is approved during this one year period, at which point the special exception is valid for the duration of the site plan or construction permit, whichever is longer.

10.4.0. - Planned developments. 
10.4.1. Generally. 
A.  Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to provide a method for landowners or developers to submit unique proposals which are not specifically provided for or allowed in districts found in this Land Development Code. In particular, these provisions allow a mix of residential and nonresidential uses and/or unique design features which might otherwise not be allowed in the district, but they must conform to all aspects of the comprehensive plan. The PD process is also intended to provide for density and intensity bonuses. 
B.  Objectives. The PD provisions are intended to promote flexibility of design and integration of uses and structures, while at the same time retaining in the city commission the absolute authority to establish limitations and regulations thereon for the benefit of the public health, welfare and safety. By encouraging flexibility in the proposals which may be considered, while at the same time retaining control in the city commission over the approval or disapproval of such proposals, the PD provisions are designed to: 
1.  Permit outstanding and innovative residential and nonresidential developments with a building orientation generally toward streets and sidewalks; provide for an integration of housing types and accommodation of changing lifestyles within neighborhoods; and provide for design which encourages internal and external convenient and comfortable travel by foot, bicycle, and transit through such strategies as narrow streets, modest setbacks, front porches, connected streets, multiple connections to nearby land uses, and mixed uses. 
2.  Provide flexibility to meet changing needs, technologies, economics and consumer preferences. 
3.  Preserve to the greatest extent possible, and utilize in a harmonious fashion, existing and outstanding landscape features and scenic vistas. 
4.  Lower development and building costs by permitting smaller networks of utilities, a network of narrower streets, and the use of more economical development patterns and shared facilities. 
5.  Achieve overall coordinated building and facility relationships and infill development, and eliminate the negative impacts of unplanned and piecemeal development. 
6.  Enhance the combination and coordination of architectural styles, building forms and building relationships within the development. 
7.  Promote the use of traditional, quality-of-life design features, such as pedestrian scale, parking located to the side or rear of buildings, narrow streets, connected streets, terminated vistas, front porches, recessed garages, alleys, aligned building façades that face the street, and formal landscaping along streets and sidewalks. 
(Ord. No. 10-1929, § 1, 9-27-2010) 
10.4.2. Minimum requirements for a planned development. An applicant for a PD must present evidence that justifies the planned development process. Justification must include one or more of the following: 
1.  The proposed development is unique and promoted by Comprehensive Plan. The use, site design, or other associated design elements associated with the proposed project are not provided for by the Land Development Code. 
2.  Size, scale, complexity and design. The proposed development is of such size, scale, complexity, and/or unique design that it would be inconvenient and inefficient to process such a proposal outside the PD process. All planned developments shall be larger than two acres. 
3.  Specialized compatibility and design characteristics. The nature of the proposed use at a specific site requires specialized design characteristics to preserve and protect neighborhood character, environmental concerns and other concerns unique to the immediate area, consistent with Comprehensive Plan policies. 
4.  The project requires the implementation of a density or intensity bonus provided for by this Land Development Code. 
(Ord. No. 10-1929, § 1, 9-27-2010) 
10.4.3. Review process. The review process for a planned development is as follows: 
1.  Pre-application meeting. The applicant for a planned development shall schedule a pre-application meeting to discuss the procedures and requirements and to consider the elements of the proposed use and site and the proposed site plan. 
2.  Citizen awareness and participation plan meeting. The applicant is subject to the citizen awareness and participation plan (CAPP) requirements of article X, section 10.0.8 of this Development Code. 
3.  Conceptual Review. The city commission conceptual review is optional and intended solely to alert an applicant to problems with, or objections to, a particular proposed development, so that a proposal may be abandoned without significant expenditure by the applicant if he/she determines that approval of the proposal will be questionable or unlikely. During concept review, no comment concerning a proposed development concept, nor any expressed approval of such a concept by the city commission, any of its members, or any officer or employee of the city, shall be relied upon by the applicant or any other person as representation or implication that the particular concept proposed will ultimately be approved in any form as a PD. 
4.  Major site plan submittal. The applicant shall follow the procedure for a major site development plan described in section 10.2.0 of this Land Development Code and additional requirements as described by this section. Planned developments are subject to formal review by the city commission as described in section 10.2.0. Notice of intent to consider a site plan for a planned development shall be advertised approximately seven days before each public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in Seminole County. In addition to the requirements of section 10.2.0, the following information should be provided: 
a.  A depiction of the areas of land devoted to publicly owned usable open space, publicly owned recreational areas, publicly owned plazas, common area usable open space, common area recreational areas and common area plazas, all expressed as percentages of the total site area. 
b.  A description of the design standards proposed to be utilized for all streets and off-street parking and loading facilities, public or private. 
c.  An enumeration of anticipated differences between the current applicable design standards of the PD property and the proposed PD standards. 
d.  A development schedule for the PD (or for each phase, if phasing is proposed). The development schedule shall not be binding, except as may be specifically required in the development agreement. 
e.  A description of all included bicycle/pedestrian/transit facilities. 
f.  A detailed description of the specific manner in which the project exceeds the standards of the Comprehensive Plan, Development Code, and other applicable visioning documents by providing a higher quality of design, including but not limited to the furthering of multi-modal transportation options, and the provision of public amenities, and well-designed civic spaces, and community activity centers. 
g.  A unified signage plan for the PD. 
h.  A detailed location map and specific narrative description of how the project will be designed to be in harmony with the surrounding area, the Heritage Village Redevelopment Strategy, and/or any development plan, and how any negative impacts to surrounding development or development plans will be mitigated. 
5.  Development agreement. 
a.  The planned development may be recorded as a development agreement consistent with section 10.5.0 of this Land Development Code. 
6.  Requirements and evaluation of PD. The PD report shall address each item in the subsections below. In considering a proposed PD for approval, the city commission shall evaluate the proposal in consideration of these criteria and approve, approve with conditions, or deny the PD application: 
a.  Conformance with the PD objectives and the Comprehensive Plan. No development plan may be approved unless it is consistent with the objectives set forth in this section and the Comprehensive Plan and any and all applicable documents. 
b.  Concurrency. The proposed PD must meet the level of service standards adopted in the Comprehensive Plan. Proof of meeting these standards shall exist in the form of a certificate of concurrency exemption, certificate of preliminary or final concurrency (as applicable at the particular review stage), or certificate of conditional concurrency reservation, or mobility fund contributions where applicable. 
c.  Internal compatibility. All land uses proposed within a PD must be compatible with other proposed uses; that is, no use may have any undue adverse impact on any neighboring use, based on the streetscape, treatment of pedestrian ways and circulation, motor vehicle circulation, and the separation and buffering of parking areas and sections of parking areas; the existence or absence of, and the location of, focal points and vistas, open spaces, plazas, recreational areas and common areas, and use of existing and proposed landscaping; use of the topography, physical environment and other natural features; use and variety of building setback or build-to lines, separations and buffering; use and variety of building groupings, building sizes, architectural styles, and materials; variety and design of dwelling types; particular land uses proposed, and conditions and limitations thereon; and any other factor deemed relevant to the privacy, safety, preservation, protection or welfare of any proposed use within the PD. 
d.  External compatibility. All land uses proposed within a PD must be compatible with existing and planned uses of properties surrounding the PD; that is, no internal use may have any avoidable or undue adverse impact on any existing or planned surrounding use, nor shall any internal use be subject to undue adverse impact from existing or planned surrounding uses. An evaluation of the external compatibility of a PD should be based on the following factors; adjacent existing and proposed uses, design of the development, traffic circulation, and density and intensity. 
e.  Intensity of development. The residential density and intensity of use of a PD shall be compatible with (that is, shall have no undue adverse impact upon) the physical and environmental characteristics of the site and surrounding lands, and they shall comply with the policies and density limitations set forth in the Comprehensive Plan. Within the maximum limitation of the Comprehensive Plan, the permitted density and intensity is adjusted based on compliance with bonus system provisions. 
f.  Usable open spaces, plazas and recreation areas. Usable open spaces, plazas and recreation areas provided within a PD shall be evaluated based on conformance with the policies of the Comprehensive Plan and the sufficiency of such areas to provide appropriate recreational opportunities, protect sensitive environmental areas, conserve areas of unique beauty or historical significance, enhance neighborhood design, and encourage compatible and cooperative relationships between adjoining land uses. 
g.  Environmental constraints. The site of the PD shall be suitable for use in the manner proposed without hazards to persons either on or off the site from the likelihood of increased flooding, erosion or other dangers, annoyances or inconveniences. Condition of soil, groundwater level, drainage and topography shall all be appropriate to the type, pattern and intensity of development intended. All requirements related to environmental management, including surface water, gateway, nature park, greenway, uplands, and wellfield overlay districts, must be met. 
h.  External transportation access. A PD shall be located on, and provide access to, a major street (arterial or collector) unless, due to the size of the PD and the type of uses proposed, it will not adversely affect the type or amount of traffic on adjoining local streets and/or other adequate transportation alternatives will be provided. Connection to existing or planned adjacent streets is encouraged. 
i.  Internal transportation access. Every dwelling unit or other use permitted in a PD shall have access to a public street either directly or by way of a private road, pedestrian way, court or other area which is either dedicated to public use or is a common area guaranteeing access. Permitted uses are not required to front on a dedicated public road. Private roads and other accessways shall be required to be constructed so as to ensure that they are safe and maintainable. 
j.  Provision for the range of transportation choices. Sufficient off-street and on-street parking for bicycles and other vehicles, as well as cars, shall be provided. Parking areas shall be constructed in accordance with such standards as are approved by the city commission to ensure that they are safe and maintainable and that they allow for sufficient privacy for adjoining uses. When there is discretion as to the location of parking in the project, it is strongly encouraged that all motor vehicle parking be located at the rear or interior side of buildings, or both. The design of a PD should, whenever feasible, incorporate appropriate pedestrian and bicycle accessways so as to provide for a variety of mobility opportunities. Connection to all sidewalks, greenways, trails, bikeways, and transit stops along the perimeter of the PD is required. Where existing perimeter sidewalks do not exist, sidewalks shall be provided by the development. 
7.  Unified control. All land included in any PD shall be under the complete, unified, legal, otherwise-encumbered control of the applicant, whether the applicant be an individual, partnership, corporation, other entity, group or agency. The applicant shall furnish the city sufficient evidence to the satisfaction of the city attorney that the applicant is in the complete, legal and unified control of the entire area of the proposed PD. The application shall not be considered by the city commission until the city attorney has certified in writing that the legal requirements of this section have been fully met. The applicant shall submit an agreement stating that the applicant will bind the successors and assigns in title to any commitments made in the adopted PD ordinance. 
8.  Phasing. The city commission may permit or require the phasing or staging of a PD. When provisions for phasing are included in the development plan, each phase must be so planned and so related to previous development, surrounding properties and the available public facilities and services that a failure to proceed with subsequent phases will have no adverse impact on the PD or surrounding properties. Concurrency certification is not reserved by PD phasing. Usable open spaces, plazas and recreation areas provided within a PD shall be evaluated based on conformance with the policies of the Comprehensive Plan and the sufficiency of such areas to provide appropriate recreational opportunities, protect sensitive environmental areas, conserve areas of unique beauty or historical significance, enhance neighborhood design, and encourage compatible and cooperative relationships between adjoining land uses. 
9.  Revised plan. If the city commission approves a PD layout plan or approves it with conditions or modifications at any step in the approval process, then the applicant shall revise the plan to clearly indicate such conditions or modifications, and file the appropriate number of copies of the revised plan with the community development department within 60 days of such approval. Failure to file the revised PD layout or development plan within the time prescribed herein shall render any approval of the city commission null and void unless the applicant files with the city commission a written request for an extension of time within such 60-day period. The city commission may grant an extension for good cause shown. 
10.  Timing. The city commission may establish reasonable periods of time for the completion of any dedicated public facilities within a PD, facilities planned for common areas, and the total PD. If phasing is provided for, time limits for the completion of each phase shall also be established or may be deferred until development review. Any such limit may be extended by the city commission upon the petition of an applicant for an amendment to the PD layout plan or development plan and based upon good cause, as determined by the city commission. Any such extension shall not automatically extend the normal expiration date of a building permit, site plan approval or other development order. If time limits contained in the approved PD layout plan are not complied with and not extended for good cause, the city commission may amend the approved development plan or take other action so as to best protect adjoining properties and the public health, welfare or safety of the City. Failure to complete phasing on schedule shall require a new concurrency review and appropriate concurrency permit. 
11.  Bonds. The city commission may also include, in the development plan, requirements for bonds conditioned upon the satisfactory and timely completion of facilities planned for common areas, for the benefit of purchasers from the applicant, and public infrastructure improvements, when the development time limits and phasing schedule do not preclude the sale of individual units prior to the completion of such facilities. 
12.  Applicability of other regulations. All building code, housing code and other land use regulations of this Land Development Code are applicable to a PD, except for those permitting special use permits and variances, and except to the extent that they conflict with a specific provision of the approved PD. Unless otherwise provided in the approved development plan, all land use regulations which apply in relation to a future land use district, including the regulation of signs, shall apply to areas of a PD. All such land use regulations shall apply in other areas of a PD in the manner determined by the city commission as part of the approved PD layout plan or, if not determined therein, by the community development director during the development plan approval process, giving due regard to the purpose of each such regulation and the similarity of each area of the PD to other Future Land Use districts, in terms of permitted uses. 
13.  Amendments to approved planned developments. 
a.  An amendment to an approved PD (except for an extension of a time limit) must be accomplished only by a resolution of the city commission. All appropriate maps, plans and reports submitted with the approved PD layout plan may be resubmitted with the petition, along with sufficient new maps, plans and reports to clearly and thoroughly indicate the proposed changes, as the new proposed PD layout plan. 
b.  Amendments to the final plan of an approved PD of the following types may be authorized by the community development director during any required development plan review: 
1.  Minor adjustments or shifts in the location and siting of buildings, structures, solid waste, recycling, and yard trash containers, parking bays and parking spaces, provided any dumpsite is not located closer to any single-family or multiple-family dwelling; 
2.  Changes in the location of utility tie-ins; 
3.  Reductions in the overall density or intensity of structural ground coverage of the development; 
4.  Changes in the location and types of landscape materials, excluding changes in location of buffers; 
5.  Minor changes in the walkway and bikeway systems; 
6.  The addition of accessory structures or utility buildings of less than 1,000 square feet where there are no major changes to the perimeter features of the development; 
7.  The addition of up to ten new parking spaces; 
8.  Modifications which do not entail amendments to specific language included within the PD ordinance.
