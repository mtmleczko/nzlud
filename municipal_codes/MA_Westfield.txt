PREFACE 
    This Code is a complete recodification of all ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted by the City Council and is the first such codification for the City of Westfield, Massachusetts since 1971. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1971 Code, as supplemented through December 15, 1977, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. If the new material is to be included between chapters 12 and 13, it will be designated as chapter 12.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix.

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this Code to which the attention of the user is especially directed is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically. Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Successfully keeping this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan N. Shekitka, Supervising Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to Patrick Henry Dowd, City Clerk, for his cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that his efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

PART I - CHARTER AND RELATED LEGISLATION 
Subpart A - CHARTER[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Printed herein is the Charter of the City of Westfield, Resolution No. 2538, as adopted by the council on April 19, 2012, effective Oct. 26, 2012. Amendments to the Charter are indicated by parenthetical history notes following amended provisions. The absence of a history note indicates that the provision remains unchanged from the original resolution. Obvious misspellings and punctuation errors have been corrected without notation. Additions made for clarity are indicated by brackets. Formerly, said Charter derived from Chapter 294, Acts of Massachusetts, 1920, as amended. 

Section 1. - Body corporate and politic. 
    The inhabitants of the City of Westfield shall continue to be a body corporate and politic under the name of the City of Westfield and shall have, exercise and enjoy all the rights, immunities, powers and privileges and be subject to all the duties and obligations provided for in this Charter or otherwise pertaining to cities as municipal corporations. 
Section 2. - Division into wards. 
    The territory of the city shall be divided into no fewer than 5 wards. Each ward shall contain, as nearly as may be consistent with well-defined limits, an equal number of voters and such wards shall be designated by number. The number of wards and, in consequence, the number of councilors may be changed by vote of the city council, subject to the approval of the mayor, upon or before such change in any year fixed by law for a new division of wards in cities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, on the effective date of this Charter, the number of wards in the city shall be 6. 
    For purposes of each preliminary and biennial election after the effective date of this Charter, the mayor and city council shall provide suitable polling places and give notice thereof. The mayor and city council shall ensure that all election officers are appointed, according to law, at least 10 days before each preliminary election to serve at the preliminary election and at the biennial election that follows the preliminary election. The mayor and city council shall have all the powers and perform all the duties of the mayor and board of aldermen, respectively, in cities under chapters 50 to 57, inclusive, of the General Laws which apply to such elections. The city clerk shall perform all the duties assigned to city clerks under said chapters 50 to 57 , inclusive, which apply to such elections. The registrars shall cause lists of qualified voters in each of the wards, established by the city council according to law, to be prepared and published. 
Section 3. - Mayor: Qualifications; chief executive officer. 
    There shall be a mayor, elected by and from the qualified voters of the city, who shall be the chief executive officer of the city. The mayor shall hold office for a term of 2 years from the first Monday in January following the election thereof, or from the following day whenever such first Monday falls on a holiday, and until a successor thereto is elected and qualified. 
Section 4. - City council; composition. 
    The legislative powers of the city shall be vested in a city council. On the effective date of this Charter the city council shall be composed of 13 members, of whom 1 shall be elected from each ward by and from the qualified voters of that ward and the remaining members shall be elected at-large by and from the qualified voters of the city. One of the city council members shall be elected by the council as its president. Councilors shall be elected at each biennial city election to serve a term of 2 years. If the number of wards is changed, as provided in section 2, then the number of members shall change but the proportion of councilors elected at-large to those elected from wards shall be maintained so that there shall be 1 more councilor elected at-large than there are councilors elected by ward. 
Section 5. - Biennial city election. 
    Municipal elections for the choice of mayor, members of the city council, members of the school committee, members of the board of directors or trustees of the Westfield Athenaeum and such other city officials to be elected to office by the voters of the city, whether by ward or at-large, shall be held biennially on the Tuesday following the first Monday of November, unless otherwise provided by law. 
Section 6. - Appointments by the mayor. 
    All heads of departments and members of municipal boards, except officials appointed by the governor, shall be appointed by the mayor subject to confirmation by the city council except as otherwise provided in this Charter or otherwise specified by law. 
Section 7. - Certificates of appointment. 
    In making appointments, the mayor shall sign and file with the city clerk a certificate in the following form: 
CERTIFICATE OF APPOINTMENT 
    I appoint (name of appointee) to the position of (name of office) and certify that, in my opinion, (name of appointee) is a recognized expert in the work which will devolve upon (name of appointee) and that I make this appointment solely in the interest of the city.

    I appoint (name of appointee) to the position of (name of office) and certify that, in my opinion, (name of appointee) is a person specially fitted by education, training or experience to perform the duties of said office, and that I make this appointment solely in the interest of the city. 
Mayor. 
Section 8. - Removal of department heads and board members. 
    Subject to the approval of a majority of the members of the city council, the mayor may remove any head of a department or member of a board before the expiration of such person's term of office except: members of the school committee; officers whose election is otherwise provided for by this Charter; and officials appointed by the governor. The person so removed shall be provided with a copy of the reasons for the removal and may contest such removal before the city council.

Sec. 4-36. - Dangerous and potentially dangerous dogs and cats. 
(a)  Procedure for determining a potentially dangerous or dangerous dog or cat. Based upon receipt of a written complaint by a citizen requesting a determination that a dog or cat is potentially dangerous or dangerous, or on the initiative of an animal control officer based on information received, such officer or the chief of police may make an investigation and determination that a dog or cat is potentially dangerous or dangerous. The investigation and determination shall be in accordance with the provisions of this article and shall be consistent with the procedures delineated in M.G.L.A. c. 140,  157. 
(b)  [Determination of potential danger or danger.] When a dog or cat is determined to be potentially dangerous or dangerous, the chief of police may order any or all of the following: 
(1)  Spaying or neutering; 
(2)  Microchip identification, tattooing or other means of permanent identification; 
(3)  Behavior training and behavioral assessment; and 
(4)  Any other order concerning the keeping, restraint, removal from the city, humane euthanasia, or disposal; of such dog or cat as may be deemed necessary, in accordance with M.G.L.A. c. 140,  157. 
Such orders may include: 
(i)  Requirements at home for dogs or cats that have been determined to be potentially dangerous or dangerous. While on the owner's or keeper's property, a dog or cat that has been determined to be potentially dangerous or dangerous may be ordered securely confined indoors or in a security-enclosed and locked pen or structure of a type meeting standards established by the animal control officer, suitable to prevent the entry of young children and designed to prevent the dog or cat from escaping. Such pen or structure must have a minimum dimension of 12 feet by 12 feet by six feet high, with a solid floor to prevent the dog or cat from digging out and a top to prevent the dog or cat from climbing out. If the pen has no solid floor secured to the sides, the sides must be embedded into the ground no less than two feet to prevent the dog or cat from digging out. The enclosure must provide the dog or cat with adequate shelter from the elements of nature. The owner shall conspicuously display a sign with a symbol warning children who cannot read of the presence of a dangerous dog or cat. 
(ii)  Requirements outside of the home for dogs or cats that have been determined to be potentially dangerous or dangerous. While off the owner's or keeper's premises, a dog or cat that has been determined to be potentially dangerous or dangerous must be restrained by a lead approved by the animal control officer not exceeding six feet in length and must be under the direct physical control of a responsible, able-bodied adult. No dog or cat designated as a potentially dangerous or dangerous dog or cat shall be permitted at public festivals, carnivals, parades or similar events. The dog or cat may be required while at large to wear a muzzle designed to prevent the dog or cat from biting. The muzzle must prevent injury to the dog or cat and must not interfere with the dog's or cat's vision or respiration. 
The owner or keeper of a dog or cat that has been determined to be potentially dangerous or dangerous must immediately notify the animal control officer if the dog or cat (a) is loose or unconfined, (b) bites a person or attacks another animal, (c) is sold, given away or dies, (d) has been moved to another address, and the location of the new address. 
(c)  Exemptions. No dog or cat may be declared dangerous if the threat, injury or damage was sustained by a person who, at the time, was committing a willful trespass or other tort upon the premises occupied by the owner or keeper of the dog or cat, or was teasing, tormenting, abusing, or assaulting the dog or cat or has in the past been observed or reported to have teased, tormented, abused or assaulted the dog or cat or was committing or attempting to commit a crime. 
The provisions of this article shall not apply to dogs owned by law enforcement agencies or law enforcement officers in the performance of police work. 
(d)  Penalties. Any person owning or harboring such dog or cat that has been deemed potentially dangerous or dangerous who fails to comply with an order of the chief of police, or his/her agents, in accordance with this section, shall be punishable by a fine of $150.00 for the first offense and $300.00 for a subsequent offense, paid to the city treasurer, or by imprisonment for not more than 30 days for the first offense and not more than 60 days for a second or subsequent offense, or both. 
If said animal is found on property not owned or controlled by its owner or keeper, or is found to be not restrained in a secure area, or is found to be in violation of any order issued by the chief of police, said dog or cat may be subject to further restriction, including an order of removal from the city or humane euthanasia, in accordance with the laws of the commonwealth. 
Each day there exists a violation of any of the provisions of this article shall constitute and be punishable as a separate offense. 
A dog or cat that has been determined to be potentially dangerous or dangerous shall not be considered legally licensed, pursuant to M.G.L.A. c. 140,  137 and 147 unless the owner or keeper is in full compliance with this article.

Sec. 9-491. - Regulated, purpose and authority. 
(a)  By virtue of M.G.L.A. c. 140,  177A, the license commission may grant a license to operate an automatic amusement device, as defined therein, for hire, gain or reward, and, after written notice to a licensee, may suspend or revoke such a license. It is the purpose and intent of this article to prohibit the license commission from issuing a license for any automatic device that is intended to be used as a gaming device or which, although meeting the definition of an automatic amusement device, may reasonably be considered to present a risk of misuse as a gaming device. 
(b)  This article is adopted in accordance with the authority granted, inter alia, by Amendment Article 89 to Article II of the Massachusetts Constitution, Chapter 294 of the Acts of Massachusetts 1920, as amended, and the powers granted, and reserved, to cities in the Massachusetts General Laws.

The fee for each device licensed pursuant to this article shall be $100.00. 
(b)  The license commission shall not grant a license for any device that is intended for use as a gaming device nor for any automatic amusement device which may reasonably be considered to present a risk of misuse as a gaming device. Automatic amusement devices which may reasonably be considered to present a risk of misuse as gaming devices are those devices which simulate actual gaming devices, including so-called "video poker" and games which involve matching forms, shapes or random number combinations.

Sec. 9-493. - Restrictions, conditions.

(b)  No automatic amusement device shall be licensed which is designed to accept currency of a value greater than a U.S. $1.00 bill. 
(c)  Automatic amusement devices shall be so installed on the premises described in the license as to be in open view at all times while in operation, and shall at all times be available for inspection. Unlicensed automatic amusement devices are prohibited. 
(Ord. No. 1371,  9-21, 3-18-04) 
Sec. 9-494. - Enforcement, penalty.

In addition, the following specific requirements also apply. Exceptions to these requirements may be made in the discretion of the superintendent of public works or his designee at the time that the street opening work is in progress. 
(1)  Excavation. Existing pavement shall be cut in neat, true lines along the area of the proposed excavation. Unstable pavement shall be removed over cave-outs and breaks and the subgrade treated as the main trench. Pavement edges shall be trimmed to a vertical face and neatly aligned with the center line of the trench. Cut-outs beyond the limits of the trench lines must be normal or aligned parallel to the center line of the trench. Excavations shall be made in open cut. Trenches and excavation shall be braced and sheathed in accordance with the requirements of the Occupation Safety and Health Act (OSHA). Sections of bituminous or cement concrete sidewalks shall be removed to the nearest scoreline or approved cut edge. 
(2)  Back-filling and compaction. Excavations shall be filled with approved backfill. Approved backfill consists of either controlled-density fill, suitable excavated material or gravel meeting M 1.03.0 or M 1.03.1 of the standard specifications. The superintendent of public works or his designee shall select which of these three to use in the excavation. Suitable excavated materials shall mean previously excavated granular material but which does not include blacktop, clay, silt, organic material, concrete, roots, boulders or stones larger than four inches in diameter. If the hole is to be filled with suitable excavated material, a backfill course shall be placed in approximately 12-inch lifts of maximum compaction to four inches below asphalt grade. A base course consisting of four inches of processed gravel or equivalent (i.e. suitable excavated material containing no stones larger than one and one-half inch in diameter) shall then be placed on tope of the backfill course. The backfill and base course shall be compacted to no less than 95 percent of maximum dry density as determined by the modified Proctor Test in accordance with ASTM 1557 method D. The permit holder if directed by the superintendent of public works or his designee will retain at its expense, a professionally qualified geotechnical consultant to perform this test. The results of this test shall be given to the department of public works. 
If controlled-density fill is used as back-fill material, it must contain a minimum of 250 pounds of class F fly ash or high air (25 percent plus) and be self-leveling. It must be type 1E or 2E (very flowable). Flowable fill is to be batched at a ready mix plant and is to be used at a high or very high slump (one inch to 12 inches). In lieu of the slump test, a six-foot long, three-inch diameter tube may be filled to the top and then slowly raised. The diameter of the resulting "pancake" may be measured and the range of the diameter shall be nine inches to 14 inches. It shall be flowable, require no vibration and after it is placed excavatable by hand tools and/or small machines. 
The ingredients shall comply with the following: 
Portland cement AASHTO M85 
Fly ash AASHTO M295 class F 
Sand M4.02.02-ASTM C33 sand 
Air M4.02.05 
Type 1E and 2E must meet the following requirements: 
Compressive 28 days 90 days 
Strength 30-80 psi 100 psi ma. 
Slump 10-12 inches 
Air 1-30 percent 
If controlled-density fill is used as back-fill material, it must fill the excavation to immediately below asphalt grade. The contractor must then plate the excavation with a heavy duty steel plate adequate to carry heavy traffic and wait twenty four hours for the CDF to cure prior to applying the permanent patch. 
If an excavation is back-filled with controlled density fill in accordance with ordinance, then a temporary patch need not be installed but a permanent patch may be installed immediately. Permanent patches installed over controlled-density fill shall consist of four inches of bituminous concrete applied in a two-and-one-half-inch base course and a one-and-one-half inch top course of bituminous concrete all installed in accordance with this ordinance for cement concrete surfaces, see [subsection] 5., below. 
(3)  Temporary patches. 
a.  Bituminous concrete. Following proper compaction, a temporary patch which shall be the thickness of the existing asphalt pavement or a minimum of four inches, whichever is greater, shall be applied. It shall consist of either cold patch or bituminous concrete plant-mixed hot asphalt aggregate. 
b.  Temporary patch to be maintained for one year. A temporary patch that has been back-filled and compacted shall be maintained by the permit holder or contractor so that the patched surface and the surrounding area remain a single smooth unbroken plane for a period of time no shorter than one year after placement of the temporary patch. 
(4)  Permanent patches. Except when installed over controlled-density fill as described in subsection (2) above, permanent patches shall be installed not less than 12 nor more than 18 months from the date of installation of the temporary patch. Upon request by the permit holder or contractor, the superintendent of public works will inspect the temporary patch and determine if final settlement of the trench has occurred and will notify the permit holder or contractor within seven days of the inspection whether the permanent patch can be installed. Public utilities or municipal departments may schedule permanent patches to replace all temporary patches without receiving prior approval from the superintendent of public works but must give the superintendent of public works or his designee not less than 72 hours' prior notice. 
A permanent patch shall consist of one of the following: (a) cold planing the temporary patch to a depth of one and one-half inches and then installing a minimum of one and one-half inches of top course of bituminous concrete, or (b) the excavation of the temporary patch in a bituminous concrete public way and replacement of this material with any additional processed gravel needed and two and one-half inches of base course and one and one-half inches of tope [top] course of bituminous concrete or (c) application of the infra-red process to the temporary patch or (d) the certification by the superintendent of public works or his designee that the temporary patch in his reasonable judgment meets fully the standard of a permanent patch and thus requires no further work. 
a.  Certification. If a permit holder seeks to qualify a temporary patch as a permanent patch, it must make the application for inspection set out above and specify in its request for certification. The superintendent of public works will notify the permit holder within 30 days of the request whether the temporary patch has been certified as a permanent patch. If it is not so certified, the permit holder shall forthwith cause a permanent patch utilizing one of the three remaining methods set out above to be utilized. 
b.  Newly paved roads. On newly paved roads, the superintendent of public works may require in addition to the placement of the permanent patch, that the permanent patch shall be treated by a process (infra-red, microwave or equivalent) that will ensure that the permanent patch is integrated into the existing bituminous surface in a seamless manner. No permit shall be issued for street openings of newly paved roads for a period of five years after the new pavement is installed, except in the case of an emergency as defined in this division. 
c.  Final inspection of permanent patch. Following completion of the permanent patch, the permit holder or contractor shall give notice thereof to the superintendent of public works or his designee who shall inspect the permanent patch. If the superintendent of public works or his designee is satisfied that the road has been restored to as good a condition as existed prior to the street opening work, he shall so note on the street opening permit and any refundable deposit securing that street opening work shall be refunded promptly to applicant. If the awarding authority representative determines that the permit holder is in default, the awarding authority may proceed in accordance with section 16-76, Remedies. 
(5)  Special rules for situations not otherwise specified. In the event that the surface to be cut and excavated is made of a material not delineated herein, the permit holder shall propose a method consistent with the goals and purposes of this division. No work shall be performed until approval by the superintendent of public works or his designee. Work shall thereafter be performed only in accordance with the approved methods. 
(6)  Shoulders. Suitable excavated material shall be placed in layers not to exceed six inches in depth and compacted shoulders shall be reconstructed to their existing condition and either loamed with six inches of loam, limed, fertilized and seeded with roadside grass mix or covered with four inches of wood chips as directed by superintendent of public works or his designee. 
(7)  Sidewalks. Any excavation in a concrete or bituminous concrete sidewalk shall require that the entire sidewalk area containing the trench be replaced. Any concrete sidewalk section that is excavated or damaged by the excavation must be replaced in its entirety. Suitable excavated material or gravel shall be placed in layers not to exceed six inches in depth and compacted. All sidewalk areas will be installed by the permit holder or contractor in conformance with the ADA and the architectural access board regulations currently in effect. Bituminous concrete sidewalks shall have two courses (two inches of binder and one inch of top) of bituminous concrete plant-mixed hot asphalt aggregate applied to and rolled to create a pavement surface consistent with the adjacent bituminous concrete surface. Concrete sidewalks shall have four inches of poured concrete applied to finish grade. The concrete shall be placed in alternate slabs 9 meters in length except as otherwise ordered. The slabs shall be separated by transverse preformed expansion joint filler 13 millimeters in thickness. Concrete driveway openings shall have six inches of poured concrete applied to finish grade. Preformed expansion joints will be installed against buildings, walls, steps, foundations or existing concrete block or brick. 
(8)  Curb and berm. Any curbing or berm which is damaged or removed as part of the street opening work shall be properly replaced in kind. The use of cast-in-place concrete curbing is prohibited. All salvageable granite curb that is removed from the public way and is excess is the property of the city and shall be delivered to the department of public works by the permit holder or contractor. 
(9)  Wheelchair ramps. Existing wheelchair ramps which are damaged or removed under street opening work shall be reconstructed in kind and in conformance with the ADA and the architectural access board regulations that are currently in effect. 
(10)  Curb cuts. Any curb cut within a public way cannot exceed the following dimensions unless specifically approved by the superintendent of public works: 
Single-family dwelling-16 feet; 
Multifamily dwelling-18 feet;

For permits issued by the board of public works the fee for review of any land development application shall be based on the amount of land to be disturbed at the site and the fee structure established by the board. 
[(5)]  Contents of the stormwater and erosion control plan. The application for a stormwater management permit shall consist of submittal of a stormwater management and erosion control plan prepared by a professional engineer licensed by the commonwealth which meets the design requirements provided by this division. The plan shall include sufficient information to evaluate the environmental characteristics of the affected areas, the potential impacts of the proposed development on water resources; and the effectiveness and acceptability of measures proposed for managing stormwater runoff. The plan must be designed to meet the Massachusetts Stormwater Management Standards as set forth in subsection (7) and the DEP Stormwater Management Handbook Volumes I and II. The applicant shall certify on the drawings that all clearing, grading, drainage, construction, and development shall be conducted in strict accordance with the plan. The minimum information submitted for support of a stormwater management plan shall be as follows: 
(a)  A locus map, 
The existing zoning, and land use at the site, 
The proposed land use, 
The location(s) of existing and proposed easements, 
The location of existing and proposed utilities, 
The site's existing and proposed topography with contours at two-foot intervals, 
The existing site hydrology, 
A description and delineation of existing stormwater conveyances, impoundments, and wetlands on or adjacent to the site or into which storm water flows, 
A delineation of 100-year flood plains, if applicable, 
Estimated seasonal high groundwater elevation (November to April) in areas to be used for stormwater retention, detention, or infiltration.

(9)  Timing, schedules, and sequence of development including clearing, stripping, rough grading, construction, final grading, and vegetative stabilization, and 
(10)  A maintenance schedule for the period of construction 
(6)  Stormwater management performance standards. 
(a)  Minimum control requirements. Projects that require a permit under this division must meet the standards of the Massachusetts Stormwater Management Policy. These standards are: 
1.  No new stormwater conveyances (e.g. outfalls) may discharge untreated stormwater directly to or cause erosion in wetlands or water of the commonwealth. 
2.  Stormwater management systems must be designed so that postdevelopment peak discharge rates do not exceed predevelopment peak discharge rates. 
3.  Loss of annual recharge to groundwater should be minimized through the use of infiltration measures to the maximum extent practicable. The annual recharge from the postdevelopment site should approximate the annual recharge rate from the predevelopment or existing site conditions, based on soil types. 
4.  For new development, stormwater management systems must be designed to remove 80 percent of the average annual load (post development conditions) of total suspended solids (TSS). It is presumed that this standard is met when: 
(a)  Suitable nonstructural practices for source control and pollution prevention are implemented; 
(b)  Stormwater management best management practices (BMPs) are sized to capture the prescribed runoff volume; and 
(c)  Stormwater management BMPs are maintained as designed. 
5.  Stormwater discharges from areas with higher potential pollutant loads require the use of specific stormwater management BMPs (see Stormwater Management Volume I: Stormwater Policy Handbook). The use of infiltration practices without pretreatment is prohibited. 
6.  Stormwater discharges to critical areas must utilize certain stormwater management BMPs approved for critical areas (see Stormwater Management Volume I: Stormwater Policy Handbook). Critical areas are outstanding resource waters (ORWs), shellfish beds, swimming beaches, cold-water fisheries, vernal pools and recharge areas for public water supplies. 
7.  Redevelopment of previously developed sites must meet the stormwater management standards to the maximum extent practicable. However, if it is not practicable to meet all the standards, new (retrofitted or expanded) stormwater management systems must be designed to improve existing conditions. 
8.  Erosion and sediment controls must be implemented to prevent impacts during disturbance and construction activities. 
9.  All stormwater management systems must have an operation and maintenance plan to ensure that systems function as designed. 
When the proposed discharge may have an impact upon a sensitive receptor, including streams, wetlands, vernal pools, storm sewers, and/or combined sewers, the authorized permitting agency may require an increase in these minimum requirements, based on existing stormwater system capacity. 
(b)  Stormwater management measures. 
1.  Stormwater management measures shall be required to satisfy the minimum control requirements and shall be implemented in the following order of preference: 
a.  Infiltration, flow attenuation, and pollutant removal of runoff on site to existing areas with grass, trees, and similar vegetation and through the use of open vegetated swales and natural depressions; 
b.  Use of stormwater on site to replace water used in industrial processes or for irrigation; 
c.  Stormwater detention structures for the temporary storage of runoff which is designed so as not to create a permanent pool of water; and 
d.  Stormwater retention structures for the permanent storage of runoff by means of a permanent pool of water; [and] 
e.  Retention and evaporation of stormwater on rooftops or in parking lots. 
2.  Infiltration practices shall be utilized to reduce runoff volume increases. A combination of successive practices may be used to achieve the applicable minimum control requirements. Justification shall be provided by the applicant for rejecting each practice based on site conditions. 
3.  Best management practices shall be employed to minimize pollutants in stormwater runoff prior to discharge into a separate storm drainage system or water body. 
4.  All stormwater management facilities shall be designed to provide an emergency overflow system, and incorporate measures to provide a non-erosive velocity of flow along its length and at any outfall. 
5.  The designed release rate of any stormwater structure shall be modified if any increase in flooding or stream channel erosion would result at a downstream dam, highway, structure, or normal point of restricted stream flow. 
(c)  Specific design criteria. Additional policy, criteria, and information including specifications and design standards may be found in the stormwater design manual. 
1.  Infiltration systems. 
a.  Infiltration systems shall be equipped with clean stone and or filter fabric adjacent to the soil or other sediment removal mechanisms; 
b.  Infiltration systems greater than three feet deep shall be located at least ten feet from basement walls; 
c.  Due to the potential for groundwater contamination from dry wells, they shall not be an acceptable method for management runoff containing pollutants; 
d.  Infiltration systems designed to handle runoff from commercial or industrial impervious parking areas shall be a minimum of 100 feet from any drinking water supply well; 
e.  Infiltration systems shall not be used as sediment control basins during construction unless specific plans are included to restore or improve the basin surface; 
f.  Infiltration basins shall be constructed with a three foot minimum separation between the bottom of the structure and the seasonal high groundwater elevation, as determined by a certified soil evaluator; and 
g.  Provisions shall be made for safe overflow passage, in the event of a storm which exceeds the capacity of an infiltration system. 
2.  [Retention and detention ponds.] Retention and detention ponds shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the criteria of the Stormwater Management, Volume Two: Stormwater Technical Handbook (March, 1997, Mass. Department of Environmental Protection, as updated or amended). 
3.  [Natural topography and land cover.] The applicant shall give consideration in any plan to incorporating the use of natural topography and land cover such as natural swales, and depressions as they exist prior to development to the degree that they can accommodate the additional flow of water. 
4.  [Swales.] The authorized permitting agency shall give preference to the use of swales in place of the traditional use of curbs and gutters based on a case by case review of stormwater management plans by the city engineer and authorized permitting agency. 
5.  [Public safety.] The applicant shall consider public safety in the design of any stormwater facilities. The banks of detention, retention, and infiltration basins shall be sloped at a gentle grade into the water as a safeguard against personal injury, to encourage the growth of vegetation and to allow the alternate flooding and exposure of areas along the shore. Basins shall have a four-to-one slope to a depth two feet below the control elevation. Side slopes must be stabilized and planted with vegetation to prevent erosion and provide pollutant removal. The banks of detention and retention areas shall be designed with sinuous rather than straight shorelines so that the length of the shoreline is maximized, thus offering more space for the growth of vegetation; 
6.  Where a stormwater management plan involves direction of some or all runoff off of the site, it shall be the responsibility of the applicant to obtain from adjacent property owners any easements or other necessary property interests concerning flowage of water. Approval of a stormwater management plan does not create or affect any such rights. 
7.  All applicants for projects which involve the storage or use of hazardous chemicals shall incorporate handling and storage "best management practices" that prevent such chemicals from contaminating runoff discharged from a site into infiltration systems, receiving water bodies or storm drains, and shall include a list of such chemicals in the application.

Sec. 16-152. - Public shade trees. 
(a)  General. 
(1)  No person other than the director of lands and natural resources or his/her designee shall plant, spray, fertilize, prune, trim, cut above the ground, remove, cause injury to, or conduct any excavation within the drip line of, a public shade tree without first filing an application and procuring a written permit from the director of lands and natural resources. The director may issue the permit, may deny the permit or may issue the permit with conditions. Failure to comply with the conditions of a previously issued permit shall be grounds for denial. 
(2)  Applications for permits must be made at the office of the department of public works not less than three business days in advance of the time the work is to commence with the exception that if the work consists of cutting down or removal of a public shade tree, the application shall be made no less than 30 days in advance. At the time that the application is submitted applicants who seek a permit to cut down or remove a public shade tree shall pay a non-refundable fee of $100.00. For all other permits, the fee to be paid is $5.00. City departments must apply for permits but are exempt from payment of a fee. The director shall waive the permit fee for those applicants who are planting public shade trees in accordance with a planting plan previously approved by the director. In cases of emergency an applicant may seek and receive oral permission from the director or his designee to trim or excavate within the drip line of a public shade tree without first submitting a written permit application. An emergency is defined as an unforeseen occurrence which requires immediate action to avoid or reduce significant injury or damage to persons or property. Within three business days after oral permission is granted, the applicant must submit a written application for the permit and the permit fee to the director who shall note the permit pre-approved due to emergency. 
(3)  Upon completion of the work the permit holder shall promptly notify the director of lands and natural resources of the need to inspect the work. Within five business days after said notification, the director or his/her designee shall inspect the work and either approve it or reject it. If rejected, the director shall provide written notice stating the basis of the rejection and setting a reasonable date for reinspection. Failure on reinspection shall be grounds for issuance of a fine as set forth below. 
(4)  The director of lands and natural resources may issue a citation of $250.00 to any person who violates the terms of this section 16-152, said citation to be disposed of by non-criminal disposition under chapter 1, section 1-9.1 of this Code of Ordinances. The penalty allowed hereunder is in addition to and not exclusive of any other penalty allowed by law, including any penalties authorized by M.G.L.A. c. 87. 
(b)  Removal.

(b)  Annual license rental payments shall be computed as set out in subsections (1) through (3) of this subsection (b): 
(1)  Overhead license rental payments. 
a.  The overhead license rental payment for each overhead facility shall be computed by multiplying the occupied area of the facility by the applicable overhead license rental rate. 
b.  The occupied area of an overhead facility shall be determined in the reasonable discretion of the city council. 
c.  The overhead license rental rate shall be determined annually by the city council within 90 days of the commencement of each fiscal year utilizing assessment data for the fiscal year just ended.

d.  An annual overhead license rate shall be calculated by: 
1.  Determining the assessed value of all taxable land in the city for the previous fiscal year, and 
2.  Dividing the amount obtained in subsection 1. by the total number of acres of land in Westfield subject to tax in that fiscal year and by expressing this quotient on a dollar per square foot basis (this represents a reasonable method to derive the value of the city's investments in its right-of-way), and

d.  An annual underground license rate shall be calculated by dividing the product obtained from the calculation described in subsection (b)(1)d. above by the useable depth of the rights-of-way in the City of Westfield as reasonably determined by the city council and expressing the quotient so obtained in dollars per cubic foot.

e.  The routine replacement of a portion of a facility or a minor adjustment of the location of part of a facility (such as the replacement or relocation of a pole or replacement of wires or cables) in situations where the use and capacity remain unchanged in some circumstances may require an applicant or co-locator to file an application (or a right-of-way permit but in such stations the exempt status of the facility shall not be affected. 
f.  All exemptions except those for municipal departments shall end upon the end of the initial permit term, but in no event later than 30 years from the effective date unless then applicable law shall require a continuation of the exemption.

(4)  Red.

Exception: Traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line or, if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown except as allowed by M.G.L.A. c. 89,  8.

(5)  Red and yellow. While the red and yellow lenses are illuminated together, drivers shall not enter the intersection and during such time the intersection shall be reserved for the exclusive use of pedestrians. 
(6)  Flashing red. When a red lens is illuminated in a traffic-control signal by rapid intermittent flashes and its use has been specifically authorized by the department of public works of the commonwealth, drivers shall stop before the nearer line of crosswalk of the street intersection or at a stop line when so marked, and the right to proceed shall then be governed by the provisions of M.G.L.A. c. 89,  8. 
(7)  Flashing yellow. A flashing yellow lens shall indicate the presence of a hazard and drivers may proceed only with caution. 
(8)  Flashing green. A flashing green lens shall indicate an intersection or pedestrian crosswalk in use or subject to use by entering or crossing traffic. Drivers may proceed only with caution and shall be prepared to comply with a change in the signal to a red or red and yellow indication.

(Ord. No. 1623, 4-2-15) 
Sec. 18-111. - Appeals, hearings.

(b)  In the event that a property owner fails to pay the stormwater utility fee as charged and the city utilizes the process set forth in M.G.L.A. c. 83,  16A through 16F to collect the unpaid charges, the property owner shall have the right to seek an abatement by filing an application for abatement with the board of public works in accordance with the remedy specified in M.G.L.A. c. 83  16E with a copy delivered to the board of assessors. The application for abatement shall conform to the requirements for a notice of appeal as set forth in subsection (a), above, and the process for a hearing before the board of public works, including the applicable time limits, shall be as set forth therein.

(f)  Requirement for pretreatment. If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in subsection (d) of this section, and which, in the judgment of the superintendent, may have a deleterious effect upon the sewerage works, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the superintendent may: 
(1)  Reject the wastes; 
(2)  Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers; 
(3)  Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or 
(4)  Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions of subsection (j) of this section. 
If the superintendent permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the superintendent, and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws. 
(g)  Wastewater pretreatment facility requirements. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this division and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in sections_l18-178(d) and (e) of this division within the time limits specified by the EPA, the state, or the superintendent, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the superintendent for review, and shall be acceptable to the superintendent before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the city under the provisions of this division. 
(h)  Measurements, tests and analyses. All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this division shall be determined in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by the city and EPA. Measurements, tests and analyses shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at such control manhole. If no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. 
Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewerage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Refer to section 18-179, Wastewater discharge permitting for industrial users and hauled waste, monitoring and reporting requirements, below, for a description of sampling techniques. 
All industries discharging into a public sewer shall perform such monitoring of their discharges as the board of public works or other duly authorized employees of the city may reasonably require, including installation, use and maintenance of monitoring equipment, keeping records and reporting the results of such monitoring to the board of public works. Such records shall be made available upon request by the board of public works to other agencies having jurisdiction over discharges to the receiving waters. 
(i)  Authority to investigate. The board of public works has the authority to investigate any sewage contribution to the system to determine any time and from time to time the characteristics of the sanitary sewer waste contribution and if it is found that the contribution is extraordinary and essentially different from the general contributions of all other users whether by chemical character, BOD, SS or volume, the board of public works may assess and the city may determine and collect a surcharge for the special treatment necessary because of the extraordinary and different waste water conditions. 
(j)  Special agreements. No statement contained in this section shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefore, by the industrial concern. 
(k)  State and federal requirements. State and federal requirements and limitations on discharges to public sewers shall apply if they are more stringent than the limitations imposed under this division.

Sec. 18-179. - Wastewater discharge permitting for industrial users and hauled waste. 
(a)  Local limits. In accordance with, and consistent with the objectives of this division, the superintendent may establish specific limitations on pollutant discharges to the POTW. The superintendent may limit any specific pollutant discharge, where such limitation is considered in the best interests of the city in properly maintaining and operating the POTW. 
The city reserves the right to establish by amendment to this division and/or by individual user permits, more stringent limitations or requirements, as it deems necessary. The city may also, by individual user pennits, establish less stringent limits or requirements where doing so serves a specific purpose and does not jeopardize the environment and is not otherwise inconsistent with other local, state or federal laws or regulations. 
The following local limits were approved by the U.S. EPA on January 17, 2017: 
PARAMETER MAXIMUM DAILY LIMIT Aluminum Report only Cadmium 0.058 1 Pounds/day Copper Report only Nickel Report only pH 5.5-10.0 Standard Unit 2 TSS Report only  
Notes: 
1 This limit is the total mass in pounds per day (lb./day) that are available to allocate to all significant industrial users (SIUs). Allocations are at the sole discretion of the city, however, a specific allocation to Westfield Electroplating can be found in the December 1, 2016 Memorandum. 
2 Instantaneous limit or grab sample limit. 
(b)  National Categorical Pretreatment Standards. 
(1)  Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards found in 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, parts 405-471, as they may be established or amended by the EPA from time to time, are hereby incorporated into this division. If upon promulgation the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards are more stringent than the applicable state requirements and/or local limitations imposed under this division for sources in that subcategory, the Federal Standard shall immediately supersede the State (per 314CMR7.00 & 12.00) requirements and/or local limitations imposed under this division, and shall be enforceable pursuant to the provisions of section 18-181 of this division and the Federal Regulations. 
(2)  Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms or either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the superintendent may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c). 
(3)  When wastewater is subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by that standard, the superintendent may impose an alternate limit using the combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e) or may require separation of the wastes for separate monitoring. 
(4)  A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment standard. 
(5)  A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. 
(c)  Dilution prohibited. No user shall increase the use of water or in any other manner attempt to dilute its wastewater discharge as a substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the categorical pretreatment standards or other pollutant-specific limitations developed by the superintendent, or imposed by state or federal requirements. 
(d)  Wastewater pretreatment facility requirements. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this division and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in sections 18-178(d) and (e) of this division within the time limits specified by the EPA, the state, or the superintendent, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the superintendent for review, and shall be acceptable to the superintendent before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the city under the provisions of this division. Pretreatment facilities shall be operated by qualified personnel with appropriate licensure at the user's expense. 
(e)  Wastewater analysis. When requested by the superintendent, a user must submit information on the nature and characteristics of its wastewater. The superintendent is authorized to prepare a form for this purpose and may periodically require users to update this information. 
(f)  Requirement for wastewater discharge permit. 
(1)  All industrial users and/or new sources shall obtain a wastewater discharge permit or a determination that a permit is not required before connecting to a public sewer or discharging directly or indirectly to a public sewer or to the POTW. The discharge permit is required in addition to the connection permit required pursuant to section 18-177 
(2)  Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this division and subjects the wastewater discharge permittee to sanctions set forth in section 18-181 of this division. Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to comply with all federal and state pretreatment standards or requirements or with any other requirements of federal, state and local law. 
(g)  Wastewater discharge permitting: existing sources. Any user required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit who was discharging wastewater into the POTW prior to the effective date of this division and who wishes to continue such discharges in the future, shall, within 90 days of the effective date of this division apply to the superintendent for a wastewater discharge permit in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section, and shall not cause or allow discharges to the POTW to continue after 180 days of the effective date of this division except in accordance with a wastewater discharge permit issued by the superintendent. 
(h)  Wastewater discharge permitting: new sources.

Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations." 
(s)  Regulation of wastes received from other jurisdictions. 
(1)  If another municipality, or user located within another municipality, contributes wastewater to the POTW, the superintendent shall enter into an intermunicipal agreement with the contributing municipality. 
(2)  prior to entering into an agreement required by the above paragraph, the superintendent shall request the following information from the contributing municipality: 
a.  Description of the quality and volume of wastewater discharged to the POTW by the contributing municipality 
b.  An inventory of all users located within the contributing municipality that are discharging to the POTW; and 
c.  Such other information as the superintendent may deem necessary. 
(3)  An intermunicipal agreement, as required by paragraph (1), above, shall contain the following conditions: 
a.  A requirement for the contributing municipality to adopt a sewer use ordinance which is at least as stringent as this division and local limits which are at least as stringent as those provided for in this division. The requirement shall specify that such ordinance and limits must be revised as necessary to reflect changes made to the city's ordinance or local limits. 
b.  A requirement for the contributing municipality to submit a revised user inventory on at least an annual basis; 
c.  A provision specifying which pretreatment implementation activities, including wastewater discharge permit issuance, inspection and sampling, and enforcement, will be conducted by the contributing municipality; which of these activities will be conducted by the superintendent; and which of these will be conducted jointly by the contributing municipality and the superintendent; 
d.  A requirement for the contributing municipality to provide the superintendent with access to all information that the contributing municipality obtains as part of its pretreatment activities; 
e.  Limits on the nature, quality, and volume of the contributing municipality's wastewater at the point where it discharges to the POTW; 
f.  Requirements for monitoring the contributing municipalities discharge; 
g.  A provision ensuring the superintendent access to the facilities of users located within the contributing municipality's jurisdictional boundaries for the purpose of inspection, sampling, and any other duties deemed necessary by the superintendent; and 
h.  A provision specifying remedies available for breach of the terms of the intermunicipal agreement. 
(t)  Monitoring and reporting requirements. 
(1)  Monitoring facililies. When required by the superintendent, the industrial user of any property serviced by the POTW shall install, at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to enable inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the user's industrial wastewater. Such facilities shall be accessible, safely located, and constructed in accordance with plans approved by the superintendent. The monitoring facilities shall be maintained by the user so as to be safe and accessible at all times. Any flow monitoring devices required by the superintendent shall be maintained and calibrated on at least an annual basis to within five percent accuracy. More stringent calibration requirements may be made on a case-by-case basis. 
(2)  Sample collection and analysis. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be preformed in accordance with procedures approved by the city and EPA. 
a.  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
b.  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
c.  Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by POTW superintendent, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits, where applicable. 
d.  For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day compliance reports, a minimum of four grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the POTW superintendent may authorize a lower minimum. For the periodic compliance reports the industrial user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements. 
(3)  Monitoring reports. Industrial users shall perform such monitoring of their discharges as the superintendent may reasonably require, including the installation, use and maintenance of monitoring equipment, keeping records and reporting results of such monitoring to the city. Reports that may be required include, but are not limited to, those required by EOA regulations at 40 CFR 403.12 including: 
a.  Baseline monitoring reports (40 CFR 403.12(b)). 
b.  Progress reports on compliance schedule for meeting categorical pretreatment standards (40 CFR 403.12(c)). 
c.  Compliance reports with categorical pretreatment standard deadline (40 CFR 403.12(d)). 
d.  Periodic reports on continued compliance (40 CFR 403.12(e)). 
e.  Notice of potential problems, including slug loading (40 CFR 403.12(f)). 
f.  Notice of violation and results of resampling. If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the control authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis at the user's cost and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the control authority within 30 days, in accordance with (40 CFR 403.12(g)(2)). Any additional testing by the control authority to monitor a violation until the control authority is satisfied that the source or cause of the violation has been corrected, will also be at the user's cost. 
g.  Results of additional monitoring (40 CFR 403.12(g)(5)). 
h.  Reports for significant noncategorical industrial users (40 CFR 403.12(h)). 
i.  Notification of changed discharge (40 CFR 403.12(j)). 
j.  Hazardous waste discharges (40 CFR 403.12(p)). 
k.  Compliance with a Best Management Practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, in cases where they are required by a pretreatment standard. The user must submit documentation required by the POTW superintendent or the pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user. 
All user reports must comply with applicable signatory and certification requirements in accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR 403.12(b)(6), 40 CFR 403.12(d) and 40 CFR 403.12(e). 
(4)  Record keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this division shall make available for inspection and copying such records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by the division, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements, and documentation associated with Best Management Practices. Users shall retain the aforementioned records for a minimum of three years and shall otherwise comply with all other record keeping requirements found at 40 CFR 403.12(o). 
(u)  Accidental discharge/slug controlplan. At least once every two years the superintendent shall evaluate whether each existing significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. In the case of an industrial user being designated as a significant industrial user, the city will evaluate the need for a slug control plan within one year. Each significant industrial user is required to notify the POTW immediately of any changes at its facility affecting potential for slug discharge in accordance with 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(vi). The superintendent may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the superintendent may develop such a plan for any user. An accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: 
(1)  Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges; 
(2)  Description of stored chemicals; 
(3)  Procedures for immediately notifying the superintendent of any accidental or slug discharge. A report on the cause of accidental or slug discharge must be submitted to the city within five days of such discharge; and 
(4)  Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transferring of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site run-off, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency response. 
(v)  Hauled wastewater. 
(1)  Septic tank waste may be introduced into the POTW only at locations designated by the superintendent and at such times as are established by the superintendent. Such wastes shall not violate section 18-179(c)-(j) of this division and any other requirements established by the city. The superintendent may limit the amount of septage discharged into the POTW as deemed necessary to protect the treatment works and limit pollutant loadings to the treatment facilities. The superintendent may require septic tank waste haulers to obtain wastewater discharge permits. Septage wastes shall not be mixed with industrial waste prior to discharge. 
(2)  The superintendent shall require haulers of industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The superintendent may require generators of hauled industrial waste to obtain wastewater discharge permits. The superintendent may also prohibit the disposal of hauled industrial waste. The discharge of hauled industrial waste is subject to all other requirements of this division. 
(3)  Industrial waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations designated by the superintendent. No load may be discharged without prior consent of the superintendent. The superintendent may collect samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with the applicable standards. The superintendent may require the industrial waste hauler to provide a waste analysis of any load prior to discharge. 
(4)  Industrial waste haulers must provide a waste-tracking form for every load. This form shall include, at a minimum, the name and address of the industrial waste hauler, permit number, truck identification, names and addresses of the waste source, and volume and characteristics of the waste. The form shall identify the type of industry, known or suspected water constituents, and whether any wastes are RCRA hazardous wastes.

DIVISION 2. - SEWER EXTENSION PLAN 

Sec. 18-200. - Permitted extension areas. 
    The plan titled Sewer Extension Plan, City of Westfield; dated October 25, 2010, is hereby adopted by the city and incorporated by reference in this division. Sanitary sewer system extensions shall only be permitted within the areas so designated on this plan. All uses and properties located within the area so designated for extension on the above referenced plan are eligible to connect into the city's sanitary sewer system without an infiltration and inflow waiver (as stated below) provided: 
(1)  For commercial/industrial uses, that the cumulative total (beginning on the date of adoption of this division [April 2, 2015]) of waste flows generated from such uses does not exceed .23 mgd, (as determined by the state Department of Environmental Protection, or such entity as shall succeed, replace or supersede the state Department of Environmental Protection). 
(2)  For residential uses, that: 
a.  The street that they are fronting on was constructed and in existence prior to the adoption date of this division [April 2, 2015], and 
b.  The cumulative total (beginning on the date of adoption of this division [April 2, 2015]) of waste flows generated from such uses does not exceed .53 mgd (as determined by the state Department of Environmental Protection, or such entity as shall succeed, replace or supersede the state Department of Environmental Protection). 
    Once the city's wastewater treatment facility's design flow capacity has been reached (as determined by the State Department of Environmental Protection, or such entity as shall succeed, replace or supersede the State Department of Environmental Protection) for these uses, additional projects of such uses within the extension area must apply for and receive an infiltration and inflow waiver. 
(Ord. No. 1623, 4-2-15) 
Sec. 18-201. - Infiltration and inflow waiver option. 
(a)  Purpose. In adopting the Westfield Sewer System Expansion Plan, the city recognizes that some projects which benefit the overriding public interest may warrant a waiver from strict compliance with the requirements set forth in section 18-200. The infiltration and inflow (I&I) waiver option has been adopted to guide and direct the city council, on a case-by-case basis, in the process and criteria for evaluating and rendering a decision on any applications for a waiver. 
(b)  Criteria. An I&I waiver may be granted to eligible projects as are set forth in section 18-202 when treatment capacity at the water pollution control plant is capable of being created through the elimination of points of infiltration and inflows of groundwater and stormwater in the city's sanitary sewer system. 
(c)  Fee. In the event of the approval of a waiver request, the applicant shall be required to pay a fee, to be determined by the city engineer, equal to the city's expense to eliminate five gallons of groundwater/stonnwater infiltration/inflows for every one gallon of sewerage projected to be generated (based on average flows) by the project. Said fee shall be paid to the city prior to the beginning of construction for work authorized in approving the application. All such fees shall be kept in a separate dedicated account to be used specifically for the purpose of eliminating infiltration and inflows of groundwater and stormwater in the city's sanitary sewer system. 
All  I&I option applications and approvals are reviewed independently and shall not set a precedent for future applications and approvals, with each petition is evaluated on its own merits. 
(Ord. No. 1623, 4-2-15) 
Sec. 18-202. - Eligible projects. 
    Only the following are eligible to apply for an infiltration and inflow waiver: 
(a)  All properties shown on the above referenced sewer extension plan as being within the extension area (at such time as the city's wastewater treatment facility's design flow capacity has been reached) 
(b)  All properties not shown on the above referenced sewer extension plan as being within the extension area, for the following specific uses: 
(1)  For residential uses which cannot be serviced by an on-site sanitary sewage system and which comply with at least one of the following criteria: 
a.  Such use provides affordable housing (must be chapter 40B qualified/eligible), 
b.  Such use is located on the water resource protection area as identified in the Westfield Zoning Ordinance and Zoning Map (such use must still have the required two-acre minimum lot sizes), 
c.  Such use is to serve an area of multiple septic systems failures and certified by the board of health as requiring public sanitary sewerage as the only viable alternative. 
(2)  For industrial/commercial uses which comply with both of the following: 
a.  Such uses increases the job and tax base of the community, and 
b.  Such extension does not create residential access.

(a)  Be made in writing to the city council and filed with the city clerk; 
(b)  Include: 
i.  Detailed engineering plans and cost estimates of all required improvements, prepared and stamped by an insured professional engineer licensed by the state, 
ii.  Detailed calculations determining the amount of sewerage anticipated to be generated by the proposed use prepared and stamped by an insured professional engineer licensed by the state,

    The city council, by a two-thirds majority vote of its entire membership, may, at a public meeting (no public hearing is required), approve a petition for an extension, not in accordance and/or compliance with the approved extension plan when, in their opinion, they find all of the following: 
(a)  That such petition complies with the requirements of sections 18-202 and 18-203, and; 
(b)  That such petition will not promote additional development in the area of a nature or at a density which the city council feels is unsuitable or undesirable, and;

CITY OF WESTFIELD ZONING ORDINANCE
ARTICLE I  ADMINISTRATION & ENFORCEMENT
Section 1-10
Section 1-10.1  Penalties and Enforcement.
1. Penalties. Any person violating any provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, any of
the conditions under which a permit is issued, or any decision rendered by the
Board of Appeals, may be fined not more than three hundred dollars ($300.00) for
each offense. Each day that such violation continues shall constitute a separate
offense.
2. Enforcement. It shall be the duty of the Superintendent of Buildings to enforce the
provisions of this Ordinance, as amended. He shall refuse to grant a permit for the
construction or alteration of any building, if the building as constructed or altered
would be in violation of any of the provisions of this Ordinance, as amended; and
state and municipal officers shall refuse any permit or license for a new use of a
building, structure or land which use would be in violation of any such ordinance
or amendment thereof.
Section 1-10.2  Filing Plot Plan. Unless otherwise ordered by the Superintendent of
Buildings, all applications for building permits made in conformity with the provisions of
the Building Ordinance of the City of Westfield shall be accompanied by plans in
triplicate, drawn to scale, showing the actual dimensions, radii and angles of the lot to be
built upon, the exact size and location on the lot of the building and accessory buildings to
be erected and such other information as may be necessary to determine and provide for
the enforcement of this Ordinance as amended.
One copy of such plans, when approved by the Superintendent of Buildings shall be
returned to the owner.
Section 1-10.3  Pending Applications for Building Permits. Nothing herein contained
shall affect any permit issued before notice of hearing by the Planning Board on the
question of adoption is first given, provided that construction work under any such permit
is commenced within six (6) months after its issue.
Section 1-10.4 -Zoning Permit Required It shall be unlawful for any owner or person to:
a. Erect, construct, reconstruct or alter any building or other structure (excluding
interior alterations, and exterior alterations which are cosmetic and/or dont
increase the exterior size of the structure).

structure or lot,
c. Change or alter lot coverage (maximum building coverage)
I-10 -2
without first applying for, and receiving, an approved Zoning Permit from the Zoning
Enforcement Officer. Such application shall be filed prior to the filing for any Building
permit, Special Permits, Variances or Site Plan Reviews.
An application for a Zoning Permit may be obtained from, and must be filed with, the
Building Department/Zoning Enforcement Officers Office. There shall be no filing fee.
It shall be accompanied by such pertinent information as the Zoning Enforcement Officer
deems sufficient to assure a full review. The larger and more complex the property or
project, the more detailed the site plan. Inaccurate information provided as part of the
Zoning permit application process, including inaccuracy of the site plan as submitted, may
cause the Zoning Enforcement Officer to void such Zoning Permit as may have been
issued hereunder. Such application may be distributed to such municipal departments that
the Zoning Enforcement Officer believes are appropriate.
A record of all applications, plans and permits shall be kept on file at the Building
Inspector/Zoning Enforcement Officers Office. The Zoning Enforcement Officer shall
take action on the application, either granting the permit or disapproving the application,
within thirty (30) days of its filing. The issuance of a Zoning Permit does not relieve an
applicant or owner of the responsibility to obtain such other zoning or non-zoning permits
and approvals as are other required. Issuance of a Zoning Permit shall not supercede the
authority of any municipal, state or federal official, departments, boards, committees or
agencies. (10/10/01)

Section 1-30
BOARD OF APPEALS
Section 1-30.1  Composition, Terms and General Authority. A Zoning Board of
Appeals is hereby established to consist of 3 members to be appointed by the Mayor and
confirmed by the City Council.
All members of the Board of Appeals shall be residents of the city. Appointments shall
be for the term of 3 years, and arranged such that no more than one term may expire in
any one year. First and second alternate members shall also be appointed, in the same
manner as the appointment of regular members, each for a 2 year term, to serve in the
case where a regular member is absent or unable to act. The Board of Appeals shall
organize yearly, choosing a chair. Vacancies shall be filled for unexpired terms in the
same manner as in the case of regular appointments. Any member may be removed for
causes by the Mayor with the approval of a majority of the members of the City Council
upon written charges and after a public hearing.
The Board of Appeals shall act on all matters within its jurisdiction under this ordinance
in the manner prescribed in Sections 10 and 11 of Chapter 40A of the General Laws, as
amended and subject always to the rule that it will give due consideration to promoting
the public health, safety, convenience and welfare, encouraging the most appropriate use
of land, and conserving property value, that it shall permit no building use, injurious,
noxious, offensive or detrimental to a neighborhood, and that is shall prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in each case.
Section 1-30.2  Specific Duties. The Board of Appeals shall, after conducting a public
hearing, decide upon:
1. Appeals of administrative actions taken under this ordinance;
2. Applications for special permits, where designated by this ordinance as the Special
Permit Granting Authority; and
3. Petitions for variances from the requirements established by this ordinance, which
may be granted only in those cases where it is proved that:
a. Owing to circumstances relating to soil conditions, shape or topography of land or
structures and especially affecting such land or structures, but not affecting generally
the zoning district in which it is located a literal enforcement of the provisions of the
ordinance would involve substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the

for outdoor storage; proposed signs and other features required by this ordinance.
The Building Inspector and/or Planning Board shall consider the standards and
objectives of the Industrial District Regulations and, specifically, the location of
the buildings, parking and loading areas and other features with respect to the
topography of the lot and existing natural features such as water courses and large
trees, with the objective of achieving maximum of coordination between the
proposed use and the surrounding uses.
The Superintendent of Buildings and/or Planning Board shall approve a plan of
development if it meets the standards of these regulations.
III  140 - 9
Should the Superintendent of Buildings and/or Planning Board determine that the
proposal does not meet the conditions of this ordinance, the Superintendent of

the reasons therefore, to the applicant. An applicant may resubmit an amended
plan for up to 12 months from the date of the denial. All projects shall be
reviewed by the Permit Granting Authority as to the potential for groundwater
contamination. If the Permit Granting Authority after consultation with the Board
of Health or any other entity that it deems appropriate determines that the project
use has potential it shall prescribe an appropriate groundwater management
program. This program may include the installation of groundwater monitoring
wells and a regular testing procedure. The Permit Granting Authority reserves the
right to withhold any and all permits until such groundwater management
programs have been approved. (10/4/90)
4. Compliance with Performance Standards: See Article IV, Section 4-120
In addition to submitting plans required above, applicants are required to submit a
statement of applicant development plan and a description of the industrial
processes involved and the types of possible effluent produced.
In reviewing the application, the Superintendent of Buildings and/or Planning
Board and/or designee may secure the advice or assistance of one or more
consultants qualified to advise as to whether a proposed use will conform to the
applicable performance standards as set out in Section 2 above.
The assistance of a consultant, if sought, must be obtained within thirty (30) days
of the receipt of the application. Such consultant or consultants shall report
within thirty (30) days after receipt of such request whether or not the use applied
for will be operated in conformance with the performance standard, and if not,
what modification in design or operation would be necessary for conformance.
A copy of the report of such consultants shall be furnished to the applicant. The
costs associated with the production of the consultants report shall be borne by
the applicant, or the applicants designee.
5. Action by Department: Following receipt of the consultants report, if any, and
upon approval of the site plan by the Superintendent of Buildings and/or Planning
Board, if required, the Planning Board shall, within ninety (90) days from date of
public hearing, either approve or disapprove, or require modifications in the plan
as submitted.
6. Change in Use: A new certificate of occupancy shall be required if there are any
major structural alterations involving an increase in the total square footage, of
greater than twenty-five (25) percent, or substantial variation from the operations
referred to in the original Building Permit.
III  140 - 10
7. Enforcement: Plans approved by the Superintendent of Buildings and/or Planning
Board shall constitute a binding agreement between the City and the developers.
Substantial deviation from plans and specifications as submitted, or a change in
use, not with standing the change in use provision, that bring the facility in noncompliance
grounds for permit revocation.
Sustained violation of the conditions of this agreement shall be grounds for a fine
levy not to exceed ten (10) dollars per month for every one hundred (100) square
feet of enclosed industrial space and revocation of occupancy permit after six (6)
months.

Section 3-160
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT DISTRICT
Section 3-160.1 Intent. The Floodplain Management District is intended to promote
the good health, safety and general welfare of all users of property within areas prone to
flooding; to minimize the need for flood rescue and relief efforts generally undertaken at
the expense of the general public; to minimize prolonged interruptions of business; to
minimize damage to public facilities and utilities; to help maintain a stable tax base by
providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to
minimize future flood blight areas; and, to insure that all users of land within the flood
prone areas are notified of the potential hazards that may be caused by flooding.
The Floodplain Management District is also intended to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by special requirements designed to:
1. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property
due to water, erosion, flood heights and velocities;
2. Require that land uses vulnerable to floods be protected against flood damage
at the time of initial construction;
3. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural
protective barriers, which re-involved in the accommodation of flood waters;
4. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase
erosion or flood damage; and
5. Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which unnaturally divert
flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
Section 3-160.2 General Provisions.
The Floodplain Management District is herein established as an overlay district, to
include all special flood hazard areas within the City of Westfield designated as Zone A
or AE on the Hampden County Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) issued by the Federal

floodway designated, the best available Federal, State, local, or other
floodway data shall be used to prohibit encroachments in floodways which
would result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
b. Base flood elevation data is required for subdivision proposals or other
developments greater than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is the lesser, within
unnumbered A zones.
III  160 - 8
c. All subdivision proposals must be designed to assure that:
1) such proposals minimize flood damage;
2) all public utilities and facilities are located and constructed to minimize or
eliminate flood damage; and
3) adequate drainage is provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
d. A certification by a professional engineer or architect, registered in
Massachusetts, that the standards of this subsection are satisfied shall be
provided to the Administrator.
2. Dimensional Standards. For any new residential construction within the areas of
special flood hazard, no lot shall have less than 21,780 square feet in area, nor less

Section 3-160.6 Floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to
the velocity of flood water which carries debris, potential projectiles and causes erosion,
in Zone AE, along watercourses within the City of Westfield that have a regulatory
floodway designated on the Hampden County FIRM, all new structures and substantial
improvement to existing structures, as well as other forms of development which may
restrict or otherwise adversely affect the floodway, shall not be permitted.

*The Residential Sub-district dimensional requirements pertain to individual townhouse lots
within a project.
Notes:
a. All residential sub-district projects will require a setback of the development as a whole
from abutting properties of at least 15 feet front, side, and rear (referred to as the Project
Buffer Zone) as measured from the project property line. An individual lot can include
the Project Buffer Zone as long as 15ft of the buffer is required to remain vegetated as set
forth in the condominium documents. The PAA may waive this requirement if by
complying with it, the developer would not be able to meet the minimum density
required.
b. For private ways, front yard setbacks will be measured from the edge of the traveled way
(not including parking). For public ways, front yard setbacks will be measured from the
edge of the right of way.
c. There is no side yard requirement for attached dwelling units, however no more than 5
units may be attached. Noncontiguous buildings require a 15ft side yard between
buildings.
2. Dimensional Waivers in Substantially Developed Sub-district. The PAA may, in order to
encourage the development of infill housing units on undeveloped lots within a Substantially
Developed Sub-district, grant a waiver to the dimensional standards of Section 3-180.8, in
accordance with Section 3-180.12 sub-section 3 Waivers.
Section 3-180.9 - Parking Requirements The parking requirements applicable for Projects
within the SGZOD are as follows.
1. Number of parking spaces. Unless otherwise approved by the PAA, the minimum number of
off-street parking spaces required shall be provided by use, either in surface parking, within
garages or other structures, or on-street:, based upon the parking requirements of the underlying
zoning district in the Westfield Zoning Ordinance.
III  180 - 10
The PAA may allow for additional visitor parking spaces beyond the maximum spaces per unit if
deemed appropriate given the design, layout and density of the proposed residential or other
development. The PAA may allow for a decrease in the required parking as provided in subsections
2 and 3 below.
2. Shared Parking. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the use of shared parking to
fulfill parking demands noted above that occur at different times of day is strongly encouraged.
Minimum parking requirements above may be reduced by the PAA through the Plan Approval
process (or, for Projects not requiring Plan Approval, prior to submission of any application for a
Building Permit), if the applicant can demonstrate that shared spaces will meet parking demands
by using accepted methodologies (e.g. the Urban Land Institute Shared Parking Report, ITE
Shared Parking Guidelines, or other approved studies).
3. Reduction in parking requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any
minimum required amount of parking may be reduced by the PAA through the Plan Approval
process (or, for Projects not requiring Plan Approval, prior to submission of any application for a
Building Permit), if the applicant can demonstrate that the lesser amount of parking will not cause
excessive congestion, endanger public safety, or that lesser amount of parking will provide
positive environmental or other benefits, taking into consideration:
a) the availability of surplus off street parking in the vicinity of the use being
served and/or the proximity of a bus stop or transit station;
b) the availability of public or commercial parking facilities in the vicinity of
the use being served;
c) shared use of off street parking spaces serving other uses having peak user
demands at different times;
d) age or other occupancy restrictions which are likely to result in a lower level
of auto usage;
e) impact of the parking requirement on the physical environment of the
affected lot or the adjacent lots including reduction in green space, destruction of
significant existing trees and other vegetation, destruction of existing dwelling
units, or loss of pedestrian amenities along public ways; and
f) such other factors as may be considered by the PAA.
4. Location of Parking. Any surface parking lot shall, to the maximum extent feasible, be located
at the rear or side of a building, relative to any principal street, public open space, or pedestrian
way.
III  180 - 11

the date that the Planning Board forwards the application to the Airport Commission.
Additionally, the application shall be referred to the City Council, Conservation
Commission, Health, Police, and Fire Departments.
4. In addition to compliance with the general requirements of the special permit
application process, an applicant for a special permit for the siting of personal wireless
services facilities must submit with its application a written site justification statement
with attached site plan. The site justification statement must explain the reason that
the applicant finds existing facilities to be inadequate to provide necessary service
coverage, must detail all alternate locations considered by applicant for the location of
the facility sought to be permitted, must explain the reason each alternate site was
rejected, and, for towers, must explain the basis for the proposed height. Failure to
supply the site justification statement or a site plan which the Planning Board finds
adequate to allow a full review of the application shall be grounds for denial. The
Planning Board shall employ an independent technical consultant to review the site
justification statement and such technical issues raised in the course of the review
process as the Planning Board deems appropriate. Municipal facilities are exempt
from having to submit a site jurisdiction statement. (10/7/02)
5. In addition to the usual fee required by applicants upon submission of an application
for a special permit, all applications filed pursuant to this section shall be accompanied
by a check payable to the City of Westfield in the sum of Two Thousand Dollars
($2,000). This sum shall be used to defray the cost of the consultant hired by the
Planning Board to assist its consideration of the application. Should any portion of
said sum not be expended, the balance shall be returned at the conclusion of the
application process.

6. Each application, whether submitted for a special permit or as part of site plan review,
shall include a written list of requested waivers with a statement of justification for
each. Only waivers authorized under III.B.3, below are permissible.
B. Standard of Review
1. The Planning Board shall act in accordance with the standards and requirements set
forth herein.
2. The Planning Board shall make findings relating to the issues in the site justification
statement. Such findings shall include but are not limited to a finding on the extent to
which existing facilities are at capacity, findings as to the effect of topography on the
site and findings as to the degree of visual impact of the facility as proposed within the
context of the specific neighborhood in which the applicant proposes its siting. There
is a presumption that financial costs are not reasons that support a determination. The
burden remains on the applicant at all times to prove to the Planning Board any reason
supporting an assertion of the unavailability or technical unfeasibility of alternate sites.
3. The Planning Board may grant a Special Permit if it finds that the applicant has met the
requirements of the ordinance and General Laws Chapter 40A and that the proposal is
in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the City of Westfield Zoning
Ordinances. Upon written application therefore, the Planning Board may grant a
waiver of strict compliance with (a) the setback requirements, (b) dimensional
requirements other than maximum tower height which is not subject to waiver, (c) the
on-site drainage requirements and (d) the demonstration requirements, provided that it
finds the waiver not to be inconsistent with the present use of the property and not
otherwise in conflict with the general purpose and intent of the City of Westfield
Zoning Ordinances. Failure of the applicant to prove minimal visual impact shall be
grounds for denial. Failure of applicant to supply information adequate or sufficient to
allow the Planning Board to conduct a full review shall be grounds for denial.
4. The Planning Board shall act on a Special Permit request within a reasonable period of
time as set forth in Article I, Section 1-50 and any denial shall be in writing and
supported by substantial evidence contained in the record.
C. Requirements.
1. Upon submission of the application for a Special Permit, the applicant shall arrange to
fly a three foot diameter fluorescent colored balloon at the primary site at the
maximum height of the proposed installation or at the request of the applicant and
discretion of the Planning Board, request to substitute a crane for the balloon at the
tower location for a minimum of 3 days. In either case photos shall be taken from 8
locations showing the test. The date and location of the flights shall be advertised at
least fourteen (14) days, but not more than twenty-one (21) days, before the public
hearing in a newspaper with a general circulation in the City of Westfield.
2. Communication Devices shall, if feasible, be located on pre-existing buildings,
structures or towers, provided such installation shall preserve the character of the
structure. The applicant shall have the burden of proving that there are no feasible
preexisting building, structures or towers. If a pre-existing tower is not appropriate,
but the site is, the old structure shall be dismantled with a new tower put in its place.
V-5-50-7
3. Shared use of Towers by commercial carriers is required unless such shared use is
shown not to be technologically feasible.
4. All Towers and associated structures shall be designed to accommodate the maximum
number of users technologically practical, a minimum of three additional users each
utilizing three bays of panel type arrays.
5. Whenever feasible, city agencies shall be allowed to attach communication antennas at
no cost to the city agency. Facilities shall enhance the City of Westfields
telecommunication, computerization and emergency communication goals.
6. Annual certification of compliance with Federal Comminations Commission, Federal
Aviation Administration, Massachusetts Aeronautics Commission and federal, state
and local laws, rules and regulations must be provided for all facilities.
7. If a Tower is on City property, a Certificate of Insurance for liability coverage in the
amounts of $1,000,000.00 must be provided naming the City as additional insured.
8. If a Tower is on City property, an agreement shall be made whereby the user
indemnifies and holds the City harmless against any claims for injury or damage
resulting from or arising out of the use or occupancy of the City owned property by
the user.
9. Equipment storage buildings or storage sheds shall not exceed one (1) story in height;
no more than three hundred (300) feet in floor area shall be available for each user;
any buildings or storage sheds added to a site must be attached to and abut the original
building or storage shed and must be compatible in appearance.
10. For a tower, execution of an agreement with the City shall be made whereby the
applicant will allow other carriers to lease space on the tower so long as such use does
not interfere with the applicants use of the tower is required.
Section 5-50.V Severability A determination of invalidity or unconstitutionality of any section
of this ordinance shall not invalidate any other section and every other provision and section shall
continue in full force and effect.

Section 5-60
Open Space Communities
Section 5-60-01 Open Space Communities. Open Space Communities shall be permitted in the
Rural Residential and Residential A districts only upon the issuance of a Special Permit from the
Planning Board (the Board), and in accordance with the Rules and Regulations Governing the
Subdivision of Land, Westfield, Massachusetts (Subdivision Regulations). Board approval of a
Special Permit hereunder shall not substitute for compliance with the Subdivision Regulations,
nor oblige the Board to approve a related Preliminary or Definitive Plan, or an ANR Plan, nor
reduce any time periods for Board consideration there under.
General Description An Open Space Community shall mean residential development in which
the houselots are clustered together into one or more groups, which are separated from each other
by permanently-protected open space.
Purposes The purposes, in order of priority, of allowing an Open Space Community are to:
a. encourage the permanent preservation of open space, agricultural lands, and other natural
and cultural resources including views of open space from both existing City roads and
from within the development;
b. encourage a less sprawling form of development, therefore consuming less open land and
allowing for the protection of ridgelines, hillsides, roadway corridors, and other visually
sensitive landscapes.
c. maintain the traditional New England rural character and land use patterns in which small
villages connect with open spaces and farmlands, thus facilitating direct access to open
space by residents of the Open Space Community.
d. allow for greater flexibility and creativity in residential design which facilitates the
addition of recreational and aesthetic amenities to new neighborhoods.
e. facilitate the construction and maintenance of streets, utilities and public
services in a more economical and efficient manner;
Section 5-60-2 General Requirements The following requirements apply to all Open Space
Communities.
a. The development shall include only those housing types otherwise allowed in the
underlying zoning district.
b. The minimum land area required shall be no less than five acres, contiguous except for
separations due to intervening roadways, and held in single ownership or control at the
time of application.
c. Each building lot shall be located, and of a size and shape, to provide a building site
which will not create adverse impacts upon the natural terrain or other land features.
5-60- 2
d. In order to facilitate multi-modal circulation. There shall be an adequate, safe and
convenient arrangement of sidewalks, bike lanes and paths, walking paths, roadways,
alleys, driveways and parking, as appropriate.
e. Prior to submission of the Special Permit application to the Planning Board, the plan shall
identify the location and extent of: 1) all wetlands on the parcel as affirmed by the
Westfield Conservation Commission (through a Determination of Applicability) under
the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act, M.G.L. Chapter 131, Section 40 and the City
of Westfield Local Ordinance 944 as amended; 2) all ground surfaces with a slope of
greater than 25%; and 3) all areas of floodplain identified as Flood Zone A on the most
recent FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Map.
f. Notwithstanding approvals hereunder, an Open Space Community must comply with all
other applicable local and state regulations.
g. Open space shall be retained primarily in contiguous areas. Front, back, and side yards of
building lots are not counted toward the open space requirement.
Section 5-60-3  Dimensional and Density Requirements Residential dwelling units, and
lawful accessory structures, may be constructed on lots within an Open Space Community
although such lots have less area and frontage than normally required, provided the layout
demonstrates preservation of open land in furtherance of the stated purposes of this section, and
the overall density of the development is no greater than what is normally allowed in the zoning
district.
The maximum number of dwelling units is based on developable land. Areas identified in 5-
60.2(e), above, shall be excluded. The remaining land shall then be further reduced by 20 percent
to account for roadway area and layout constrains. The final land area is then divided by the
minimum lot size normally required in the district to arrive at the maximum number of dwelling
units permitted in the Open Space Community.
Where, in the judgement of the Board, the aforementioned method will not result in a reasonable
estimate of the number of dwelling units which could be built on the parcel conventionally, the
Board may require the applicant to provide further evidence in the form of a conventional
Preliminary Plan in conformance with the Subdivision Regulations and applicable zoning in the
district, evidence of successful percolation testing and soil evaluations sufficient to meet Board of
Health requirements for on-site disposal systems, and approvals by the Conservation Commission
of any work in areas under their jurisdiction.
There shall be excluded from the number of lots shown on the conventional Preliminary Plan all
lots which the Board finds are not reasonably buildable, whether by reason of excessive
development and site preparation measures or costs; sanitary disposal, drainage, water supply or
vehicular access problems; restrictive easements or encumbrances; limited or unusuallyconfigured
buildable area; the presence of surface waters, bordering vegetated wetlands, land
subject to flooding, steep slopes, ledge, rock outcroppings, land subject to state or federal
restrictions; or a combination of the foregoing. In consideration of the foregoing, the Board may
rely upon findings and recommendations of the Board of Health, Sewer or Water Commission,
Conservation Commission, Highway Department, City staff, or any appropriate state or federal
agencies.

**100 feet of lot width is required at the building line. Flag lots are permitted as described herein.
Flag lots, with a minimum frontage and width of 40 feet at any point of measurement between
sidelines, may be permitted as a design measure in furtherance of the purposes of this bylaw,
provided that the pole portion does not exceed 500 feet in length, and that the flag portion meets
all applicable lot area and yard requirements above. No two flag lots may adjoin one another at
the street.
Section 5-60-4  Design Requirements Where appropriate in the judgement of the Board for the
individual development site, the following additional criteria shall be incorporated into the
proposed site plan for an Open Space Community:
1. Open Space Layout: Open Space should include the most sensitive resource areas on the
property and should be designed as larger blocks of land. Fragmentation, or the creation
of long, thin strips of open space should be avoided. Whenever possible, the open space
shall be laid out to preserve roadside views along City roads, and views from City roads
into the development. Physical and visual access to the open space for homeowners shall
be maximized in the design of the development, with open space areas readily
differentiated from private lots. Wherever possible, when open space directly adjoins
private lots, it shall be demarcated with logical, straightforward boundaries such as
existing rock walls, tree lines, hedges, topographical breaks, a roadway or path, or post
and rail fencing. Where the boundaries of the open space are not readily observable in
the field, the Board may require placement of survey bounds sufficient to identify the
location of the open space.
Open spaces shall, to the greatest extent feasible, be laid out in deference to Westfields
Open Space Plan, so as to be contiguous and complementary with open space areas of
similar character (whether permanently preserved or not) on adjacent parcels, and to
facilitate the through movement of wildlife.
2. Development Location: Residential lots and access streets shall be grouped in locations
designed to: take advantage of solar access opportunities; maintain scenic views,
particularly those seen from Westfields roads; provide internal views of open space for
residents; protect prime wildlife habitat; preserve historic and prehistoric sites and their
environs; and protect natural features such as, but not limited to. surface waters, drainage
courses, vernal pools, wetlands, floodplain, aquifers, older-growth trees, fields, and
unique geologic formations. Development along existing scenic roads and creation of
new driveway openings on existing regional roadways shall be minimized.
5-60- 4
3. Pedestrian Circulation: Dedicated open spaces shall be laid out in
conjunction with existing and proposed streets and sidewalks so that the greatest degree
of internal pedestrian circulation and access to both on-site and off-site open space is
achieved. Walking loops are preferred over one-way routes. Access onto open space
must be clear and direct, and arranged in a manner that does not conflict with the actual
or apparent use of private lots. Access to open space from the new street network shall
be provided by a strip of land at least 20 feet wide, suitable for a footpath, from one or
more streets in the development. Where the open space is to be owned by the City of
Westfield, adequate provisions shall be included to accommodate public use, including
locations for placement of future parking spaces and signage.
4. Vehicular Circulations: Where the Planning Board deems that it is in the citys best
interest and is consistent with the intent and purpose of the state Zoning Act and
Subdivision Control Law, through streets shall be laid out to connect with existing or
potential streets on adjacent land. Street segments designed with open space on one or
both sides are encouraged.
5. Landscaping: Naturally - occurring vegetation shall be conserved to the great extent
feasible, especially along existing City Roads. Landscaping and tree removal is subject
to the approval of the Board prior to any work and final approval of the Open Space
Community. Common areas (such as community greens and cul-de-sac islands) shall be
landscaped with deciduous shade trees (minimum 2 inch diameter at breast height,) and
flowering shrubs with high wildlife conservation value. Unless existing forest trees are
retained, both sides of new streets shall be planted with deciduous shade trees (minimum
2 inch diameter at breast height), at a suggested interval of 60 feet, which may vary
according to species selected and site-specific factors, at the discretion of the Board.
6. Shoreline Areas: In areas within 200 feet from each bank of any water body or
watercourse (as defined by M.G.L. c.131,S 40), lots shall be laid out, to the greatest
extent feasible, to achieve the following objectives:
a. A significant portion of the shoreline shall be a part of the dedicated open space.
b. No excessive erosion, sedimentation, water pollution or disruption of the natural
flow of the water will result from the construction.
c. Fisheries and wildlife habitat within and along the water body or watercourse are
protected.
d. An undisturbed buffer strip of native vegetation 50 feet back from each affected
bank is maintained.
e. A minimum set-back for structures from all banks of 100 feet, and from
Bordering Vegetated Wetlands of 50 feet is maintained.
7. Agricultural Areas: In agricultural areas, lots shall be laid out, to the greatest extent
feasible, to achieve the following objectives:
a. Developed areas are located on the least fertile soils for agricultural use so that
land mapped as Prime Agricultural Land or of State Importance by the
U.S.D.A. Natural Resources Conservation Service will remain available for
future agricultural use.
5-60- 5
b. Structures are located within any wooded upland on the parcel, or along the far
edges of open fields.
c. Residential and agricultural areas are situated to minimize the lengths of any
common boundaries between new house lots and lands preserved for agriculture.
d. Dwelling units and non-agricultural structures are separated from the agricultural
uses by a 100 foot wide buffer strip of trees and native plantings sufficient to
reduce conflicts between farming operations and residents.
8. Upland Areas: In areas of greater than 15% slope or upon hilltops and ridgelines, lots
shall be laid out, to the greatest extent feasible, to achieve the following objectives:
a. Potential building sites are located so the tops of structures will be below the
ridgeline or hilltop or, if the site is heavily wooded, the tops of structures shall be
lower than the existing canopy height of trees on the ridge or hilltop.
b. The removal of native vegetation is minimized.
c. Grading or earth-moving is planned and executed in such a manner that the final
contours are consistent with the existing terrain, both on and adjacent to the site.
9. Forestry Areas: In forested areas where there exists a potential for a sustained - yield of
forest products, (based on existing vegetation, parcel size, contiguity with other forestry
parcels, and forestry site indices), lots shall be laid out, to the greatest extent feasible, to
achieve the following objectives:
a. Areas of older-growth forest or productive forest soils are included in the
dedicated open space.
b. Access for logging equipment is provided in a manner that does not conflict with
the residential uses.
c. Adequate buffering is provided in order to minimize disruption of residential
areas or conflicts with the use of other open space areas, and to assure the safety
of the residents.
Section 5-60-5  Open Space Requirements The total area of open space shall equal or exceed
the sum of the areas by which any residential lots are reduced below the minimum lot area
normally required in the zoning district; oversized lots shall not compensate for reduced-size lots
in this calculation. Regardless, a minimum of 50 percent of the gross parcel area under
consideration shall be set aside as open space for recreation, conservation, forestry, or agricultural
uses which retain the property in essentially its natural condition thereby preserving the scenic
and aesthetic qualities of the land.
Areas identified in 5-60-2(e), above, any account for no greater a percentage of the minimum
required open space area than the percentage these areas represent of the gross parcel area. Open
space dedicated in excess of the minimum required may contain any percentage of areas
identified in 1601 (e), above.
Further subdivision of the open space is prohibited. Structures or buildings accessory to
recreation, conservation, or agricultural uses may be erected, but shall not exceed five- percent
coverage of said open space.
5-60- 6
At the discretion of the Board, the following options are available for ownership of the open
space.
a. Conveyance to a community association, corporation, or trust owned by the owners of
lots within the development. If such a community association is utilized, ownership
thereof shall pass with conveyances of the lots in perpetuity.
b. Conveyance to a non-profit organization, the principal purpose of which is the
conservation and preservation of open space.
c. Conveyance to the City, at no cost, and acceptance by the City Council for a park or open
space use. Such conveyance shall be at the option of the City and shall require the
approval of the City Council.
d. Retention by the original owner or conveyance to a new owner, subject to all conditions
and restrictions of the Special Permit, Definitive Plan approval, and Conservation
Restriction.
e. An appropriate combination of the above.
In any case where such land is not conveyed to the City, a perpetual restriction enforceable by the
City shall be recorded to ensure that such land shall be kept in an open or natural state and not be
built upon for residential use or developed for accessory uses such as parking or roadways. Such
restrictions shall further provide for maintenance of the open space in a manner which will ensure
its suitability for its function, appearance, cleanliness, and proper maintenance of drainage
facilities, utilities, and the like. Such restrictions shall be recorded in a Conservation Restriction
in perpetuity as authorized by M.G.L. c. 184, SS31-33. Where the aforementioned Conservation
Restriction is deemed by the Board not to be appropriate for all or a portion of the open space, the
Board may authorize an alternative method of restriction.
Section 5-60-6  Community Association If option 5-60-5 (a), above, is approved, a nonprofit,
incorporated community association shall be established, requiring membership of each lot
owner in the Open Space Community. The community association shall be responsible for the
permanent maintenance of the common open space and any associated facilities. A community
association agreement or covenant shall be submitted with the special permit application
guaranteeing continuing maintenance of such land and facilities, and assessing each lot a share of
maintenance expenses. Such agreement shall be subject to the review and approval of the Board.
Such agreements or covenants shall provide that in the event the association fails to maintain the
common open land in reusable order and condition in accordance with the agreement, the City
may, after notice to the association and individual property owners and a public hearing, enter
upon such land and maintain it in order to preserve the taxable values of the properties within the
development and to prevent the common land from becoming a public nuisance. The agreements
or covenants shall also provide that the cost of such maintenance by the City shall be assessed
ratably against the properties within the development.
Prior to the conveyance of any lot, the community association must be organized, and an
association agreement or covenant signed and recorded at the Registry of Deeds.
The developer shall be responsible for all maintenance costs, liabilities, insurance costs, and any
other costs associated with the open space until at least fifty- percent of the lots are sold.
5-60- 7
Section 5-60-7  Review Process Prior to formal application for a Special Permit, the applicant
shall arrange for and conduct a field visit to the property with City staff, including, but not limited
to the planner and conservation commission coordinator.
To construct an Open Space Community it is necessary to first have an approved Special Permit.
Following approval of the Special Permit, the applicant may then submit for approvals under the
Boards Subdivision Regulations pertaining to Open Space Communities. The Definitive Plan
shall be in conformance to the Special Permit and any conditions thereto. All conditions of the
special permit shall be met at the time of endorsement of the Definitive Plan by the Board.
Upon approval of the Special Permit, all restrictions upon the use of the designed open space
areas shall be in effect. Any subsequent acts in violation of these restrictions shall be grounds for
revocation of the Special Permit and denial of approvals under the Subdivision Regulations.

Site plan approval is a regulatory role of the Planning Board, intended to control site
development. The Planning Board shall not deny site plan approval based upon the
proposed used of the property if that use is one which is allowed as a matter of right.
Site plan approval is required for all uses of land or buildings located in the following
districts: Commercial A, Court Street Mixed Residence/Business, Broad Street Mixed
Residence/Business, C.O.R.E., Business A, Business B, Industrial A and Industrial Park.
This requirement applies to all new construction in these listed districts. It also applies in

Section 7-10.2(a).
The Director of Planning and Community Development and the Chairman of the
Planning Board shall each have the authority to waive the necessity for Planning Board
approval for changes in use of existing buildings, subject, however, to ratification of the
waiver by vote of the Planning Board at its next regular meeting. Notwithstanding a

6. That lighting of the site shall be adequate at ground level for the protection and safety
of the public in regard to pedestrian and vehicular circulation; that the glare from the
installation of outdoor lights and illuminated signs is properly shielded from the view
of adjacent property and public rights-of-way.
7. That all utility systems are suitably located, adequately designed and properly
installed to serve the proposed uses, to protect the property from adverse pollution.

Special Permit Granting Authority only as to its the potential for groundwater
contamination and consistency with the intent this Section. If it determines that the project
use has potential to pollute groundwater, it shall withhold approval or it shall prescribe and
condition appropriate measures, such as a groundwater management program which may
include the installation of groundwater monitoring wells and a regular testing procedure.
3. A Special Permit may be granted upon the finding that the proposed use, and the
development thereof, meets the following standards:
a. the use is in harmony with the intent of this ordinance and district and will not
interfere with water resource protection;
b. the use is appropriate to the natural topography, soils, drainage, vegetation and
other water-related characteristics of the site, and is designed to minimize
substantial disturbance of these natural site characteristics; and
c. the use will not, during construction or thereafter, adversely affect the existing or
potential quality or quantity of groundwater available in this district;
3-170.11 Performance Standards. The following shall apply to all uses, whether allowed by
Special Permit or by-right:
1. Any land use resulting in more than either 2,500 square feet per lot or 15% of the total lot

from impervious surface shall be recharged on the site by stormwater infiltration basins or
similar systems utilizing natural vegetation, and not directly to any streams or surface
waters. Groundwater recharge shall be attained through site design that incorporates
natural drainage patterns and vegetation, and through the use of stormwater infiltration
basins, infiltration trenches, porous pavement or similar systems. Subsurface pits allowing
stormwater drainage to seep into surrounding soil (drywells) shall be used only where other
methods are infeasible, but in all cases shall include appropriate pre-treatment measures.
Discharge to groundwater shall be preceded by oil, grease, and sediment traps or other
established methods which facilitate removal of contaminants. Infiltration systems greater
than 3 feet deep shall be located at least 100 feet from drinking water wells, and should be
situated at least 10 feet down-gradient and 100 feet up-gradient from building foundations
to avoid seepage problems. Infiltration basins and trenches shall be constructed with a 3
feet minimum separation between the bottom of the structure and maximum groundwater
elevation.

3. All recharge systems shall be permanently and properly maintained in full working order
by the owner. Logs of maintenance activities of such systems shall be made available to the
zoning enforcement officer upon request.
4. Sodium chloride for ice control shall be used at the minimum salt to sand ratio which is
consistent with the public highway safety requirements, and its use shall be eliminated on
roads or parking lots which may be closed to the public in winter.
5. The storage of sodium chloride, calcium chloride, chemically treated abrasives or other
chemicals used for the removal of ice and snow on roads shall be within a building or
completely covered and on a solid and impervious surface with curbs or berms designed to
prevent the generation, infiltration and escape of any contaminated run-off.
6. Fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, lawn care chemicals, or other leachable materials should
be minimized and shall be used in accordance with the Lawn Care Regulations of the
Massachusetts Pesticide Board, 33 CMR 10.03 (30, 31) with manufacturers label
instructions and all other necessary precautions to minimize adverse impacts on surface and
groundwater. Logs of any commercially-applied materials shall be made available to the
zoning enforcement officer upon request.
7. The storage of commercial pesticides, fertilizers and soil conditioners shall be within
structures designed to prevent the generation and escape of contaminated run-off or
leachate.
8. To extent feasible, all new permanent animal manure storage areas shall be covered and/or
contained to prevent the generation and escape of contaminated runoff or leachate.
9. All hazardous materials and petroleum products shall be stored above ground level in a free
standing container, either within a building or in a covered container or tank on a solid and
impervious surface, with protections to contain a spill. A tertiary containment system, with
the outer containment designed and operated to contain the total storage volume plus an
additional 10% shall be utilized.
10. All vehicle and motorized craft maintenance facilities must have floor drains, unless in
receipt of a variance from the State Plumbing Board, which must be connected to a
municipal sewer system or, in unsewered areas, to a state-approved holding tank. All other
facilities, which use, store or maintain hazardous materials or wastes must, with state
approval, seal floor drains or connect them to the sewer system or holding tank.
11. No parking, maintenance or storage of commercial motor vehicles shall be permitted,
except on a solid and impervious ground or floor surface, unless associated with
agricultural or active on-site construction activities.
12. Disturbed land areas shall be stabilized with perennial grass or vegetative cover within 45
days after the completion or cessation of construction, except that during winter months
other erosion control methods may be utilized until the growing season.
13. The replacement of underground storage tanks shall be permitted provided that all such
replacements are of no greater volume, and are in compliance with the general ordinances
of the City (Section 8-26).

of the costs of the remaining work, increase the amount of the performance guarantee
proportionately, and establish a new date for completion of said required
improvements. Failure of the developer to complete the improvements within said
two (2) year period, or any extension thereof, shall not relieve the developer from
his/her obligation to pay for increased costs for completing the improvements in

intent of the Subdivision Control Law. In waiving strict compliance, the Board may require
such alternative conditions as will serve substantially the same objective as the standards or
regulations waived.

the event of an interrupted installation of any of the above service, it is required that the
developer renotify the Board and the City Engineer prior to recommencing installation. Any
development which progresses beyond the inspection stage without City approval will be
required to return the construction to the status necessary to perform the required inspection.

requirement for final approval.
