PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Fairburn, Georgia. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1966 Code, as supplemented through January 2, 1997, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1966 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 RELATED LAWS RL:1 SPECIAL ACTS SA:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 RELATED LAWS COMPARATIVE TABLE RLCT:1 SPECIAL ACTS COMPARATIVE TABLE SACT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself that stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Sandra S. Fox, Code Attorney, and Beth Tattershall, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to C. Bradford Sears, City Attorney; Jim Williams, City Administrator; Nancy Faulkner, City Clerk; and Amanda Ferguson, Records Manager, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

(a)  The catchlines of the several sections of this Code printed in boldface type are intended as mere catchwords to indicate the contents of the section and shall not be deemed or taken to be titles of such sections, nor as any part of the section, nor, unless expressly so provided, shall they be so deemed when any of such sections, including the catchlines, are amended or re-enacted. 
(b)  The history or source notes appearing in parentheses after sections in this Code are not intended to have any legal effect but are intended merely to indicate the source of matter contained in the section. Editor's notes, Charter references and state law references that appear after sections or subsections of this Code or which otherwise appear in footnote form are provided for the convenience of the user of the Code and have no legal effect. 
(c)  All references to chapters, articles, divisions, subdivisions, or sections are to chapters, articles, divisions, subdivisions, or sections of this Code, unless otherwise specified. 
(Code 1966, § 1-3) 
Sec. 1-5. - Effect of repeal of ordinances. 
    The repeal of an ordinance shall not revive any ordinances in force before or at the time the ordinance repealed took effect.

(Code 1966, § 1-4) 
Sec. 1-6. - Severability of parts of Code. 
    It is hereby declared to be the intention of the city council that the sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this Code are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this Code shall be declared unconstitutional by the valid judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality shall not affect any of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and sections of this Code. 
(Code 1966, § 1-5) 
Sec. 1-7. - Supplementation of Code. 
(a)  By contract or by city personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized or directed by the city council. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive, permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the city council or adopted by initiative and referendum during the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages that have become obsolete or partially obsolete. The new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. Charter amendments may be included in a like manner. 
(b)  In the preparation of a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code that have been repealed shall be excluded from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages. 
(c)  When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified Code.

Sec. 5-1. - Purpose; rationale and findings. 
(a)  Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, moral, and general welfare of the citizens of the city, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses within the city. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable access to any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. 
(b)  Rationale and findings. Based on evidence of the adverse secondary effects of adult uses presented in hearings and in reports made available to the city council, and on findings, interpretations, and narrowing constructions incorporated in the cases of City of Littleton v.

Jackson, 214 (1978); And based upon reports concerning secondary effects occurring in and around sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, Austin, Texas-1986: Indianapolis, Indiana-1984; Garden Grove, California-1991; Houston, Texas-1983, 1997; Phoenix, Arizona-1979, 1995-98; Chattanooga, Tennessee-1999-2003; Los Angeles, California-1977; Whittier, California-1978; Spokane, Washington-2001; St. Cloud, Minnesota-1994; Littleton, Colorado-2004; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma-1986; Dallas, Texas-1997; Montrose, Illinois-2005; Kennedale, Texas-2005; American Planning Association-2001; Greensboro, North Carolina-2003; Amarillo, Texas-1977; New York, New York Times Square-1994; and the Report of the Attorney General's Working Group On The Regulation Of Sexually Oriented Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota). 
    The city council finds: 
(1)  Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects, including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation. 
(2)  Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be separated from other sexually oriented businesses, to minimize the secondary effects associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of sexually oriented businesses in one area. 
(3)  Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the city has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects, which is the city's rationale for this chapter, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually-oriented businesses. Additionally, the city's interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the city. The city finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this chapter are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.

(a)  Levy. An occupation tax shall be levied upon those businesses and practitioners of professions and occupations with one or more locations or offices in the corporate limits of the city and upon the applicable out-of-state businesses with no location or office in the state pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-13-7, based upon gross receipts of the business or practitioner in combination with the profitability ratio for the type of business, profession, or occupation as measured by nationwide averages derived from statistics, classifications, or other information published by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, or successor agencies of the United States. Each type of business shall be assigned to a profit class based on the profitability ratio for that business type. The occupation tax class table ranges below are based on the 2012 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of the business. The occupation tax rate levied will be based on the profit class of the dominant line of business as defined by the NAICS. A listing of businesses and their assigned tax classes along with a list of the NAICS codes applicable to each business is available for inspection in the city clerk's office during regular business hours. 
(b)  Occupation tax schedule. The tax rate determined by profitability ratios in combination with gross receipts for each business, trade, profession, or occupation shall be as follows and will be developed and updated from time to time by the city administrator:

ARTICLE VI. - FLEA MARKETS 

Sec. 14-163. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Flea market means and includes any business, whether operated as an individual concern or operated as a unit within a larger organization, structure or facility which derives 25 percent of its gross receipts from the sale, trade or barter of used or previously owned personal property, other than operable motor vehicles. In this connection, therefore, all businesses in the city which meet the definition contained herein shall be subject to the provisions of this article dealing with flea markets, whether the same be generally known as jewelry stores, coin shops, salvage operations, clothing stores or by any other name or names; provided, however, nothing contained herein shall apply to any purchase where the retail value of the merchandise or goods is $10.00 or less. The term "flea market" is interchangeable with and applicable to "swap meet," "indoor swap meet," or other similar terms regardless of whether these events are held inside a building or outside in the open. The primary characteristic is that these activities involve a series of sales sufficient in number, scope, and character to constitute a regular course of business. 
    Flea market operator means a person who owns or has charge, care or control of the flea market. 
    Flea market vendor means a person who engages in the retail sale of personal property at a flea market.

Such application shall be made on a form presented by the city manager and shall contain such information as, in the opinion of the city manager, is necessary to properly regulate the business. 
(b)  Flea market vendors. All persons, before beginning the business of selling, buying, trading or bartering in a flea market, shall first file an application with the city manager for a license to conduct such business. Such application shall be made on a form presented by the city manager and shall contain such information as, in the opinion of the city manager, is necessary to properly regulate the business. 
(c)  Investigation of applications. The chief of police shall cause an investigation to be made into the information contained in the applications described above (promoters and vendors) and into the background, character and reputation of applicants as the chief deems advisable. After such investigation, the chief shall file a written report with the city manager, whose duty it shall be to make a decision on the issuance of the license. 
(d)  Revocation of license. The city manager shall revoke the license of any flea market promoter when, in the sole discretion of the city manager, such revocation is necessary to prevent the purchase, sale, barter or trade of stolen property or to prevent the purchase, sale, barter or trade of property with minors; and provided the promoter has been previously warned of such activity and has not taken action to prevent a recurrence. The city manager shall have the duty to revoke the license of any vendor when, in the discretion of the city manager, such revocation is necessary to prevent the activity described above concerning stolen property or minors; and the failure to keep and provide accurate records shall be prima facie evidence of a vendor dealing in stolen property or with minors or both. 
(Code 1966, § 10A-2; Ord. No. 88-7, § I, 11-28-1988) 
Sec. 14-165. - Precautions to be taken.

The form shall be dated and require an accurate description of the personal property, including identifying marks, numbers and manufacturers and shall include personal identification as to name, address, sex, race, height, weight and date of birth, and shall include either a legible thumbprint or information showing that the vendor was shown positive identification by the seller or trader of the property. A valid driver's license with photo or identification of like quality shall be required, and such identification shall be all that is acceptable as positive identification. The city manager may from time to time describe identification other than driver's licenses that may be accepted as positive identification and which, in his opinion, is of like quality. 
(b)  Forms to be supplied to law enforcement officers. Each business covered by subsection (a) of this subsection shall provide law enforcement officers with the forms completed since the last previous request for the same. 
(c)  Dealing with minors prohibited. It shall be unlawful for any flea market vendor or other business owner similarly situated, its agents or employees to purchase or trade for any merchandise or property with minors. The burden to ascertain age shall be upon the vendor or business.

ARTICLE XII. - MASSAGE THERAPY ESTABLISHMENTS/MASSAGE PARLORS 

Sec. 14-345. - Findings and purpose. 
    The mayor and council find that it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to provide for the regulation of massage therapy establishments/massage parlors. The unlicensed practice of massage therapy has, in certain contexts, been associated with criminal behavior that damages the reputations of those who comply with the law as well as the communities in which these businesses operate. This finding is based upon the experience of other communities and municipalities. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with such establishments are depression of property values in the surrounding neighborhood, increased expenditures for law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, increased burden on the judicial system, and acceleration of community blight by the concentration of such establishments in particular areas, Accordingly, it is in the best interest of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community to enact regulations to reduce the adverse impacts of massage therapy establishments/massage parlors. 
    A majority of the states, as well as the District of Columbia, have found it necessary to regulate massage therapy and to provide for education and state certification. In these states, licensed massage therapists must, meet legal requirements to practice their profession, which may include minimum hours of training and passing an exam; Georgia is one of these states, requiring 500 educational hours including clinical work, an exam, and 24 continuing education hours for each two-year license renewal period. [American Massage Therapy Association; O.C.G.A. § 43-24A-1 et seq.] The purpose of this article is to reasonably regulate massage therapy establishments/massage parlors in a manner that serves the legitimate governmental interest of reducing criminal activity, protecting property values, and providing for safe and sanitary conditions without unreasonably infringing upon the protected rights of massage therapy establishments/massage parlors and their patrons. A license issued pursuant to this division is a privilege, not a right.

(a)  In the event that any city employee responsible for or involved in restoring an existing covered account, handling an existing covered account or accepting payment for a covered account becomes aware of red flags indicating possible identity theft with respect to existing covered accounts, such employee shall use his or her discretion to determine whether such red flag or combination of red flags suggests a threat of identity theft. If, in his or her discretion, such employee determines that identity theft or attempted identity theft is likely or probable, such employee shall immediately report such red flags to the utility director who will notify the city administrator or assistant to the city administrator. If, in his or her discretion, such employee deems that identity theft is unlikely or that reliable information is available to reconcile red flags, the employee shall convey this information to the utility director who may in his or her discretion determine that no further action is necessary. If the utility director in his or her discretion determines that further action is necessary, a city employee shall perform one or more of the following responses, as determined to be appropriate by the utility director: 
(1)  Contact the customer; 
(2)  Make the following changes to the account if it is apparent that someone other than the customer has accessed the customer's covered account:

If, in his or her discretion, such employee determines that identity theft or attempted identity theft is likely or probable, such employee shall immediately report such red flags to the utility director who will notify the city administrator or assistant to the city administrator. If, in his or her discretion, such employee deems that identity theft is unlikely or that reliable information is available to reconcile red flags, the employee shall convey this information to the utility director, who may in his or her discretion determine that no further action is necessary. If the utility director in his or her discretion determines that further action is necessary, a city employee shall perform one or more of the following responses, as determined to be appropriate by the utility director:

The city administrator is responsible for reviewing reports prepared by staff regarding compliance with red flag requirements and with recommending material changes to the program, as necessary in the opinion of the city administrator, to address changing identity theft risks and to identify new or discontinued covered types of covered accounts. Any recommended material changes to the program shall be submitted to the city council for consideration by the council. 
(1)  The utility director will report to the city administrator at least annually on compliance with the red flag requirements. The report will address material matters related to the program and evaluate issues such as:

(Ord. No. 2008-11, § 1(1-12), 10-27-2008) 
Sec. 41-113. - The application process. 
    It is the City of Fairburn's responsibility to require proper documentation for providing service to our citizens in order to collect for this service. Any attempts to apply for service with the City of Fairburn or Fairburn Utilities with altered or suspicious documents should be considered a RED FLAG - the application and all supporting paperwork including lease, identification, etc. should be presented to the utility director for further research before any service may be rendered. 
    In order to obtain service with Fairburn Utilities, a completed signed application should be submitted with proper supporting documents as follows: 
(1)  Application. The application should be completed and signed by the applicant (an "On-Line" application implies a signature). A credit check cannot be obtained without a customer's signature allowing the City of Fairburn to access their credit information. Landlords do not have to complete an application each time they have service turned on at a rental property, but in order to comply with the new regulations, each landlord should have a signed application on file with Fairburn Utilities and be given a customer ID number to reference when they call in for service. This application would apply to any service at any of their rental properties. 
(2)  Lease/rental/purchase agreement. We must have a lease/rental agreement or purchase agreement showing who is the legal occupant of the property. Any document that appears to be altered in any way would provide a RED FLAG alert and the paperwork should be brought to the attention of the utility director to be verified. If the landlord does not provide a lease/rental agreement, he must send a landlord verification statement allowing us to provide utility service that must include the following information: 
 Property location 
 Person(s) leasing/renting the property 
 Date the agreement is effective 
 Landlord's name and a telephone number where he can be reached if we need to verify the information. 
(3)  Picture I.D. An unexpired picture I.D. issued by a state or federal government should be presented at the time of the application process. Forms of identification allowed are: 
 State driver's license 
 State issued Photo I.D. 
 Georgia Voter I.D. Card 
 Valid U.S. Military Photo LD. 
 Valid U.S. Passport I.D. 
 Resident Alien I.D. card (issued by the U.S. Department of Justice - Immigration and Naturalization Services) 
(4)  Social Security Number. Fairburn Utilities requires a Social Security Number for identification purposes based on Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Privacy Act of 1974,2004 Edition. 
OVERVIEW OF THE PRIVACY ACT OF 1974,2004 EDITION (SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER USAGE) 
"any disclosure of a social security number to any federal, state, or local agency maintaining a system of records in existence and operating before January 1,1975, if such disclosure was required under statute or regulation adopted prior to such date to verify the identity of an individual. 
(b) Any federal, state or local government agency which requests an individual to disclose his social security account number shall inform that individual whether that disclosure is mandatory or voluntary, by what statutory or other authority such number is solicited, and what uses will be made of it. 
(5)  Before checking credit using "Online Utility Exchange", the city representative should make sure that the application is complete, that it is signed and that it is dated correctly. All fields should be completed, especially the following: 
a.  Name. Be sure the name is the same as the name on the lease agreement or purchase agreement. This is the responsible party, not someone listed as living at the residence. 
b.  New service location address. Check the new location as follows: 
(i)  See what service is needed at the address, i.e. electric, water, etc. 
(ii)  Compare the listed landlord with the one on the lease or rental agreement. If they are not the same, this should send up a RED FLAG. 
(iii)  Check the previous tenant's account. Service that has been disconnected for non-payment within the last few days should be a RED FLAG. 
For any of these RED FLAGS, send the customer to the utility director for further investigation. 
c.  Landlord (or owner). The landlord's name and phone number should be on the application. Enter the landlord's customer ID number beside his name. An application must be on file for each landlord if they wish to call in for service. A list of landlords and their customer ID numbers will be kept as a reference. If the landlord does not appear on the list, he must complete an application within ten days or service at his rental property may be disconnected. 
d.  Phone number. A phone number should be provided in case we need to reach the customer. This may be a home phone, cell phone or work phone if they are allowed calls at work, or any combination. 
e.  Current address (or previous address if already moved). If the address that they are moving from does not agree with any address on credit reports (reports may have previous addresses listed in the near future), then this should send up a RED FLAG. If a RED FLAG is raised, send the applicant to the utility director. 
f.  Social Security number. A Social Security number is required for utility service with the Fairburn Utilities pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974. This is a requirement listed on the application and is necessary. Without a Social Security number we cannot prove identity and we cannot collect the debt. 
Anyone legally working in the United States (Citizen or Non-Citizen) may obtain a Social Security number for tax reporting purposes. When we run the credit inquiry, a Social Security number that does not match the name (RED FLAG) or that displays alerts (RED FLAG) of any kind should be sent to the utility director for further research. 
g.  Driver's license number. This should be the I.D. number on an unexpired state or government issued picture I.D. Look at the customer and make sure they are the same person who is applying for service. If they do not look like the picture on the I.D. or if the I.D. has been altered (RED FLAG), send to the utility director. 
h.  Date of birth. Check the picture ID to see if the date of birth agrees with the date they put on the application. 
1.  If the person does not appear to be the age they claim to be (RED FLAG), send to the utility director. 
2.  If the date of birth on the application does not match the date of birth on the picture ID (RED FLAG), send to the utility director. 
3.  If the date of birth on any credit report does not match the application or picture ID (RED FLAG), send to the utility director. 
i.  Current employer. The employer field should never be left blank. If the customer does not work, they should put none, n/a, retired, SSI, baby sit, etc. 
If they work for a temporary agency, i.e. Kelly Services or Westaff, that should be their employer, not the plant or office where they perform their job. If in question, ask who pays them. 
j.  Signature of customer. No credit inquiry can be run if the application is not signed by the customer. No one else can sign the customer's name unless they have a "Power of Attorney" and a copy of the "Power of Attorney" should be attached to the application. 
k.  Date. The date on the application should match the date on the Credit Bureau inquiry. Also, the date may be very important in years to come by matching the date the application was submitted with the date service was provided. Always check the date and be sure the applicant put the correct date, especially the year, on the application.

    Building sewer (sometimes called house lateral) means the extension from the building drain to the public sewer or other place of disposal. 
    Chemical oxygen demand (COD): A measure of the oxygen reducing capabilities of wastewater due to chemical reactions. Wastewater with inorganic material (such as chemicals from household cleaners and detergents) can cause chemical reactions that absorb oxygen. If large quantities of these chemicals enter wastewater, chemical reactions occur which consume large amounts of oxygen. If the oxygen level in the water drops too much, fish and other aquatic life may not survive. POTWs can only treat small quantities of COD in wastewater. If COD levels become too high, the wastewater may pass through the POTW only partially treated thus endangering aquatic life in water. 
    Commercial-industrial wastes: Any and all other wastes not being domestic wastes but not limited to the wastes from commercial, laboratory and industrial processes, wastes from domestic operations or certain trade operations such as sand, grit, waste petroleum products from automotive service stations, and the like, animal wastes, straw and related items from dairy or other farming operations. 
    Commercial use shall apply to any property that is zoned in the city or county for a commercial use or regardless of zoning, is put to a commercial use.

    Grease renderer: An organization that will pick-up the collected recyclable grease from the food service operations at little or no charge. The material will then be used in reprocessing for animal feed, tallow, and soap production and in composting. 
    Grease trap: A device designed to retain grease from one to a maximum of four fixtures. A grease trap is not appropriate for use on heated water (e.g., dishwasher) or in-line to a waste disposal unit (e.g., garbage disposal and grinders). For purposes of this manual, a grease trap is a small, indoor device. 
    Industrial user: A source of discharge, which introduces pollutants into the publicly-owned treatment works from any non-domestic source. 
    Liquid waste hauler: Any person, firm, corporation or other entity that collects, pumps, transports and/or disposes of liquid wastes. 
    Local limit: A maximum pollutant level placed on wastewater discharged to the city sewer.

    Properly shredded garbage means the waste from the preparation, cooking and dispensing of food that has been shredded to such a degree that all particles will be carried freely under the flow conditions normally prevailing in public sewers with no particle greater than one-quarter inch in any dimension. 
    Public sewer means a sewer that is controlled by the city. 
    Residential use shall apply to any property that is zoned in the city or county for a residential use, unless the property is being put to a commercial use. 
    Sanitary sewer means a pipe or conduit that carries sewage and to which stormwaters, surface waters and groundwaters are not intentionally admitted. 
    Sanitary Sewer Overflow (SSO): Overflow of a city sewer often due to a blockage in a line. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that up to 80 percent of SSOs are caused by oil and grease blockages. Sanitary sewer overflows often result in the release of many thousands of gallons of untreated wastewater.

b.  Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions). 
c.  Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand, or chlorine requirements in such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment works. 
d.  Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes constituting slugs as defined herein. 
(9)  Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amendable to treatment processes employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction over discharge to the receiving waters. 
(f)  If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in subsection (e) of this section, and which may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the city may: 
(1)  Reject the waste; 
(2)  Require deregulation or other control over the quantities and rates of discharge to the public sewers; 
(3)  Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes not covered by existing sewer charges under the provisions of subsection (l) of this section; or 
(4)  Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition to the city, the waters or wastes before discharge to the public sewers. 
(g)  If the city permits: 
(1)  The pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval of the city, and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances, and laws. 
(2)  A discharger subject to federal regulations set forth in 40 CFR 128 to connect to the public sewers, the discharger shall be required to comply with all pretreatment requirements of that regulation. 
(h)  Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the city, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the city, and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. 
(i)  Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense. 
(j)  When required by the city, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control manhole, together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the sewer, to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the wastes. Such manholes, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the city. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times. 
(k)  All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this article shall be determined in accordance with those test procedures for analysis of pollutants which are cited and described in 40 CFR 136 of the Federal Register, and shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. (The particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHs are determined from periodic grab samples.) 
(l)  Persons wishing to discharge wastewaters to the city's sanitary sewerage system in amounts exceeding the volume of water purchased from the city, must receive written permission from the city before discharging the excess amounts. The city shall require the installation of additional meters or other devices as may be deemed necessary to establish the volume of wastewater discharged.

(m)  Where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the city that a portion greater than 50 percent of the water purchased as measured by the water meter or meters does not enter the sanitary sewerage system, the city may require or shall permit the installation of additional meters or other devices as may be deemed necessary to establish that portion which does enter the sanitary sewerage system, and the corrected metered flow will be used for sewerage billing. All such additional facilities shall be provided by the owner of the premises concerned or other interested parties at no expense to the city. 
(n)  No statement contained in this section shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment, subject to payment therefor, by the industrial concern. 
(o)  Where BOD and/or suspended solids in excess of normal concentration are found to be compatible with the sewerage system by the city, the persons discharging such wastes shall be charged and assessed a surcharge in addition to any sewer service charges. Normal concentrations for these constituents are defined as follows: 
(1)  A five-day, 20-degree Centigrade biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of 250 milligrams per liter as determined by laboratory analysis in accordance with subsection (k) of this section. 
(2)  A suspended solids content of 300 milligrams per liter as determined by laboratory analysis in accordance with subsection (k) of this section. 
The amount of such surcharge shall reflect the cost incurred by the city in handling the excess constituents to include but not be limited to operation and maintenance, administration, depreciation, amortization and other expenses attributable to the sewerage system. 
(p)  All new and existing food service establishments as well as multi-residential complexes and other program participants are required to comply with the City of Fairburn Grease Management (FOG Control Program) Policies and Procedures Manual most recently adopted by the city council. The Grease Management (FOG Control Program) Policies and Procedures Manual may be amended by appropriate city departments from time to time. The purpose of the program is to reduce discharges of fats, oil and grease from program participants into the wastewater collection system in order to reduce and prevent sewer system overflows. All program participants will be periodically inspected by the city to ensure compliance with the program requirements. The city will establish a monthly fee which will be added to program participant's sewer bills to recover the cost of the program. The fee will be included in the city's fee schedule. No fee shall be charged to any FSE that prepares, on average, less than ten full meals per month. An annual commercial waste permit will be required for all pretreatment systems existing and new. The permit fee is based on the type of pretreatment system at the facility. All commercial waste permits shall be issued annually from January 1 thru March 31. An existing facility obtaining a permit after March 31 will be charged a 25 percent penalty fee. A new facility opening after the annual permit period will not pay a penalty unless it has been determined by the city that the facility has been opened for more than 30 days. There will be no prorated fee for a new facility applying for a commercial waste permit after the permitting period. The fee will be included in the city's fee schedule.

    Approved or approval means compliance with the applicable specifications or criteria developed or accepted by the city administrator. 
    Failure means a condition of an on-site sewage system that constitutes a public hazard by inadequate treatment or disposal of sewage. 
    Malfunctioning system is an on-site sewage management system that permits sewage to discharge or flow from it into any storm, drain, stream, water body, gutter, street, roadway, or public place, or if sewage discharges from the system to the surface or subsurface of any property so as to create a nuisance or a condition detrimental to health. Substantial backflow from the leaching area (absorption lines) into the tank during a tank pump-out shall also be considered an indication of a malfunctioning system as determined by a registered and certified service person employed by a septic system service company registered with the county. 
    On-site sewage management system means a sewage management system other than a publicly owned and maintained sewage treatment system serving one or more buildings, mobile homes, recreational vehicles, residences, or other facilities designed or used for human occupancy or congregation. The term "on-site sewage management system" shall include, without limitation, conventional and chamber septic tank systems, privies, and experimental and alternative on-site management systems that are designed to be physically incapable of a surface discharge of effluent that may be approved by the state division of public health. 
    Septic tank means an approved watertight tank designed or used to receive sewage from a building sewer and to effect separation and organic decomposition of sewage solids, and discharging sewage effluent to an absorption field or other management system. 
    Sewage means and includes human excreta, all water-carried wastes, and liquid household waste from a residence or commercial and industrial establishments. 
    Sewage treatment system is a system that provides primary treatment and disposal, including absorption field components, devices, and appurtenances intended to be used for the disposal of sewage by soil absorption. The system shall be designed to be physically incapable of a surface discharge of effluent. 
(b)  Routine inspection, maintenance, repair, and reporting. 
(1)  The on-site sewage management systems (herein "septic systems") within the city shall be regularly serviced as required in this section. 
(2)  Required servicing of septic systems must include both inspection of the septic system components and pumping of the septic system's tanks. The maximum service interval for required septic system service shall not exceed five years from the date of the last certified inspection and service. 
(3)  Septic tank and absorption field and line inspection, maintenance service, pump-out and repairs shall be conducted by a septic tank contractor and service personnel certified by the state and registered with the county health department. 
(4)  Property owners who install, or inspect and service, their septic tanks shall record their service history on the city's septic tank guide and maintenance record file or suitable alternative. Any qualifying certified service will establish the beginning of the five-year interval. 
(5)  Upon completion of the installation, required inspection, maintenance, and any necessary repair to the septic system, the contractor shall certify that the work was conducted and completed in accordance with the accepted professional standards and practices and that the system is in property working order. 
(6)  No building permit for renovation or modification shall be issued on any existing residential structure that is not in compliance with the provisions of this section. 
(c)  Service requirements; extensions. 
(1)  Requests for extensions to any deadline or time period identified within this section should be directed to the city administrator in a timely manner so as not to violate the design of this section. A property owner's intent to petition the city administrator for an extension on an impending deadline will not be deemed an excuse for failure to comply with the timeframes herein. 
(2)  Once a property owner's petition has been taken under consideration by the city administrator, however, no penalty or further violation will accrue until the matter is decided, unless the violation is identified as creating a threat to public health and safety. 
(3)  In the event that the septic system malfunctions during the time that a petition for extension is before the city administrator, the property owner must immediately remedy the septic system malfunction and withdraw the petition from further consideration. 
(d)  Record maintenance. The on-site sewage management system owner shall be responsible for maintaining current records of installation, maintenance, and inspections. 
(e)  Malfunctioning systems. 
(1)  An on-site sewage management system shall be deemed to be a malfunctioning system if sewage is allowed to discharge or flow from it onto the property, into any storm drain, stream, water body, gutter, street, roadway or public place, or if sewage discharges from the system to the surface or subsurface of any property so as to create a nuisance or a condition detrimental to health. Substantial backflow from the leaching area (absorption lines or field lines) into the tank during a tank pump-out shall also be considered an indication of a malfunctioning system as determined by a registered and certified service person employed by a septic system service company registered with the county. 
(2)  In addition, any and all parts of a septic system that are found by a registered and certified service person employed by a septic system service company registered with the county to be damaged, misaligned, or missing (such as, but not limited to, a cracked lid, missing "T," or misaligned outflow line) shall constitute a malfunctioning system. 
(3)  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, all property owners with septic systems or other approved on-site sewage management systems shall be responsible for correcting the malfunctioning of such systems within 30 days from receipt of written notification, which notice shall communicate the specifics of the malfunction. Reporting of repairs shall be consistent with subsection (b) of this section. 
(f)  Basis for extensions. Extensions to modify the five-year reporting and servicing requirement as specified in subsection (b) of this section may be granted under the following conditions: 
(1)  The owner of a septic system may required an administrative extension, demonstrating unusual hardship and unique circumstantial basis for approval. If the request indicates that the septic system can be serviced at an interval longer than five years, and the owner certifies the information submitted with the request is accurate, then the extension may be submitted for approval by the city administrator. Extensions are valid for a period of one year, subject to renewal upon requalification. 
(2)  Examples of consideration for an extension may include, but are not limited to: 
a.  Usage significantly less than capacity of system. 
b.  No full-time occupancy. 
c.  Advanced technology septic system.

If the utility does not commence such replacement or repair after 20 working days following written notice from the city, the city or the owner of the affected structure or property may make such replacement or repair and the utility shall pay the reasonable and actual cost of the same. 
(b)  Whenever it is necessary to replace or relocate a joint use pole: 
(1)  The city shall give reasonable notice thereof in writing (except in the case of an emergency, when verbal notice will be given and subsequently confirmed in writing) to the utility, specifying in such notice the time of such proposed replacement or relocation, and the utility shall at the time so specified transfer its attachments to the new or relocated joint pole; or

In the event the utility notifies the city that the transfer has been completed, and the city returns to the job site and discovers that the transfer has not been made, the utility shall pay the city's costs of the trip to and from the job site. The intent of this paragraph is to ensure timely transfers and minimize situations of two or more poles needlessly remaining at the same location for extended periods of time.

ARTICLE V. - THE BUILDING PROCESS 

Sec. 62-141. - Overview. 
    The building process in the city is divided into two sections: the plan review, permit and inspection process for single-family residential structures; and the plan review, permit and inspection process for commercial, industrial, office, institutional, and multifamily residential structures. 
(Ord. No. 2005-21, art. 4, 9-24-2005; Ord. No. 2012-15, § 1, 12-10-2012) 
Sec. 62-142. - Single-family residential structures. 
    This section pertains to the construction of single-family detached residential structures on individual zoning lots in the city. Following is a step-by-step outline of the process and the requirements involved in completing this process: 
(1)  Step 1: permits. The construction of a single-family residential structure requires two permits: 
a.  A site development permit; and 
b.  A building construction permit. 
As a first step in the permit process, a builder should consult with the permit manager to determine exactly what is required for permit applications, the fees involved, the necessary inspections, and the schedule for the various steps in the process. 
(2)  Step 2: application for site development permit. In order to obtain a site development permit, the builder must submit a complete development permit application package to include: 
a.  A completed development permit application form; 
b.  An accurate and up-to-date boundary survey of the property including location of any floodplain and tree save area; 
c.  A complete and accurate site development plan; and 
d.  The appropriate plan review, permit and inspection fees. 
(3)  Step 3: incomplete packages; resubmittal. Upon submittal, the permit manager shall determine whether or not the package is complete. If it is not complete, it shall be returned to the builder with instructions as to what needs to be done to complete it, and it must then be resubmitted at a later date. This determination shall be made by the permit manager within two working days of the submittal. There is no charge for a resubmittal at this time. 
(4)  Step 4: review by development staff. If it is determined that the package is complete, it shall be officially accepted for staff review, the date of acceptance shall be noted, and the package shall be promptly distributed to the development staff. The development staff shall have ten working days to review the package and make a determination as to whether or not a site development permit will be issued. 
(5)  Step 5: denial of site development permit; resubmittal. If a decision is made that a site development permit cannot be issued, the permit manager shall promptly notify the builder, and provide the builder with the reasons for the decision and an explanation of what will need to be done to correct any deficiencies. There will be a charge for any resubmittal at this time. 
(6)  Step 6: issuance of site development permit. If the site development permit application package is approved, the permit manager will issue a site development permit authorizing the initial construction activities on the site. 
(7)  Step 7: initial inspection. Upon issuance of a site development permit, a builder shall first install any required tree-save fence and erosion control facilities, and have that installation inspected and approved by the development inspector. This initial site inspection shall be done within two working days of the builder's request. Work on subsequent phases of the construction cannot proceed until this initial inspection is approved. From this point on, the development inspector shall inspect the site on a regular basis in order to assure that the development of the site is proceeding in accordance with the approved site development plan. If at any time the development inspector determines that work is not being done in accordance with the approved plan, he shall take the appropriate enforcement actions to possibly include a stop work order, citations, and/or a cash bond. 
(8)  Step 8: application for building construction permit. After a site development permit is issued, a builder may then apply for a building construction permit. An application package for a building construction permit shall include: 
a.  A completed building construction permit application form; 
b.  A complete set of plans and specifications for the proposed structure; and 
c.  The appropriate permit and inspection fee. 
(9)  Step 9: review by permit manager and building official. The permit manager and the building official shall review the building construction permit application package within five working days of its submittal and either approve it or return it to the builder with the reasons for it not being approved along with an explanation of what needs to be done to correct any problems that may exist at this point. If the application package is approved, the building official may then issue a building construction permit for the proposed structure. 
(10)  Step 10: site clearing and grading; footing and foundation work. Upon approval of the installation of the tree-save fencing and erosion control facilities, the builder may next proceed with the site clearing and grading, and the initial footing and foundation work. This work will be inspected by the building inspector within two working days of a request for an inspection. If, for any reason a reinspection is required, there will be reinspection fees for that work. 
(11)  Step 11: submission of foundation survey. Once the foundation is installed, a builder must have a foundation survey prepared. The foundation survey shall be submitted to the building official for approval. No building construction work shall be allowed to proceed on the site until the building official approves the foundation survey. The building official must either approve the foundation survey or deny approval within two working days. If it is not approved, the builder will be instructed as to what needs to be done to get the necessary approval. 
(12)  Step 12: interval inspections and reinspections. Upon approval of the foundation survey, the building inspector shall perform inspections on request at the appropriate construction intervals. These inspections shall be done within two working days of the request. If the building inspector does not approve the work requested for inspection, a reinspection fee shall be charged for a followup inspection. In addition to requested inspections, the building inspector may inspect any construction project at any time. 
(13)  Step 13: final building inspection. Upon completion of the structure, the builder shall request a final building inspection, which shall be performed by the building inspector within two working days of the request. 
(14)  Step 14: final site inspection. Upon completion of the development of the site, the builder shall request a final site inspection, which shall be done by the development inspector within two working days of the request. 
(15)  Step 15: application for certificate of occupancy. Upon approval of the final building inspection and the final site inspection, the builder may request a certificate of occupancy, which shall be issued by the building official within two working days of the request. 
(16)  Step 16: issuance of certificate of occupancy. Upon issuance of the certificate of occupancy, the builder may turn the property over for occupancy for its lawfully intended purpose. Under no circumstances shall a property be occupied prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Citations shall be issued and additional enforcement measures may be employed for any unauthorized occupancy. Issuance of a certificate of occupancy officially marks the end of the single-family residential building process. 
(Ord. No. 2005-21, § 5.40, 9-24-2005; Ord. No. 2012-15, § 1, 12-10-2012) 
Sec. 62-143. - Commercial, industrial, and multifamily residential structures. 
    This section pertains to the construction of commercial, industrial, office, institutional, and multifamily residential structures in the city. Following is a step-by-step outline of the process for building these structures and the requirements involved in completing the construction process: 
(1)  Step 1: review of sketch plan. The first step in the building of a non-single family residential structure should involve the preparation of a sketch plan of the proposed project and the review of that sketch plan with the planning and zoning coordinator. This will enable the builder to become familiar with the process, the plans that will be involved, the fees, and the necessary inspections. There is no charge for this step in the process. 
(2)  Step 2: preparation of conceptual site plan. Following a review of a sketch plan, the builder shall prepare a conceptual site plan. The purpose of a conceptual site plan is to provide a builder with an economical way to work with the city in reaching a general agreement as to the nature of a proposed project and its conformance with the codes, ordinances and plans of the city. For the conceptual site plan review, a builder will not need detailed architectural and engineering drawings. A conceptual site plan may be drawn at any reasonable scale on a sheet of any reasonable size; however, it does need to be clearly and accurately drawn by a design professional, and, as a minimum, the following information should be provided: 
a.  An accurate, up-to-date and certified survey of the property on which the project is to be built. 
b.  A vicinity map showing the property in relation to the general area of the city in which it is located. 
c.  The name of the proposed project. 
d.  Name, address, phone number, and fax number of the owner, the developer and the designer who prepared the plan. 
e.  Graphic scale, north arrow, and date of preparation. 
f.  Zoning of the property with required setbacks shown. 
g.  Zoning, use, and ownership of all adjoining property. 
h.  Total area of the site, and the area of the site proposed to be devoted to impervious surfaces. 
i.  Approximate topography of the site. 
j.  Significant natural features on and adjacent to the site, including the 100-year floodplain, if appropriate. 
k.  Existing manmade features on the site. 
l.  Proposed site layout including buildings, drives, parking, walkways, landscaped-areas, tree save areas, buffers, easements, utilities and any other features necessary to properly present the concept. 
m.  Proposed off-site improvements which may be necessary to properly develop the site. 
n.  Architectural elevations to show the intended architectural character of the proposed building and the nature of the materials to be used. 
o.  If the site plan is for an addition to or a change in an existing site plan, the drawings must clearly show the changes that are being proposed. 
(3)  Step 3: submission of conceptual site plan; review standards. Ten full-size copies and one 11-inch by 17-inch copy of the conceptual site plan shall be submitted to the planning and zoning coordinator, who shall promptly note the date of submittal and distribute the plan for staff review. The planning and zoning coordinator will be responsible for assuring conformance with the zoning ordinance set forth in chapter 80, the subdivision regulations set forth in chapter 77, and the GA74 Overlay Ordinance, if applicable. The city engineer will be responsible for the technical review of the plans and specifications, and the fire marshal will be responsible for the fire safety aspects of the submittal. 
(4)  Step 4: review of conceptual site plan by city staff. The staff shall have ten working days after submittal to complete the review of the conceptual site plan, and notify the builder of the staff conclusions and recommendations. If it is approved by the staff, it shall be scheduled for review by the planning commission at the next regularly scheduled meeting at which it can be put on the agenda. If it is not approved, it shall be returned to the applicant with the reasons for disapproval and an explanation of what needs to be done to secure approval. A resubmittal fee will be required, and the applicant will need to repeat steps 2 and 3, set forth in subsections (2) and (3). 
(5)  Step 5: report and recommendations by staff. The staff shall prepare a report for the planning and zoning commission which explains the proposed project and make recommendations as to whether the conceptual site plan should be approved, and, if so, what conditions should be included with that approval. 
(6)  Step 6: review by planning and zoning commission. The planning and zoning commission shall take action on the proposed conceptual site plan. If it is approved, the builder can proceed with the next step in the process. If it is not approved, the builder may begin the process over again starting with step 2, set forth in subsection (2), and a new fee will be required. 
(7)  Step 7: permits required. Upon approval of the conceptual site plan by the planning and zoning commission, the builder may prepare the necessary plans and specifications for the construction of the building. These are divided into two separate submittals: 
a.  The first submittal is for a site development permit; and 
b.  The second is for a building construction permit. 
(8)  Step 8: application for site development permit. The submittal for a site development permit shall include the following materials: 
a.  A completed site development permit application form; 
b.  Ten complete sets of the site development plans and specifications to include: 
1.  A copy of the approved conceptual site plan with a copy of any conditions the mayor and council may require; 
2.  A site layout plan; 
3.  A grading plan; 
4.  A utilities plan; 
5.  A drainage plan; 
6.  An erosion and sedimentation control plan; 
7.  Engineering details as necessary; 
8.  Tree protection plan; and 
9.  Landscape plan; 
c.  A proposed sign program; 
d.  A proposed site lighting plan; 
e.  Specifications as to the design of accessory features like fences, retaining walls and paving; 
f.  A hydrological study and such other studies and reports as may be required by the city engineer and fire marshal; and 
g.  The appropriate plan review and inspection fees. 
All plans shall be drawn at a reasonable scale on sheets of a reasonable size. All plans must be clearly and accurately drawn by a design professional licensed to practice in the state. All plan sheets must be signed and sealed by the professional who prepared the plans. 
(9)  Step 9: application for building construction permit. The submittal for a building construction permit shall include the following materials: 
a.  A completed building construction permit application form; 
b.  Five complete sets of the architectural plans and specifications prepared by a professional architect registered in the state; and 
c.  The appropriate permit and inspection fees. 
(10)  Step 10: review of application for site development permit. The city engineer has ten working days from the date of submittal to review the site development plans and specifications in order to make a determination as to whether a site development permit will be issued. If it is determined that a permit will not be issued, the builder will be notified of the decision and given an explanation of what will need to be done to secure approval. There will be a charge for resubmittal of the plans. 
(11)  Step 11: issuance of site development permit. If the plans and specifications are approved, the city engineer will issue a site development permit authorizing the initial construction activities on the site and the builder will be promptly notified and provided with a set of approved plans. At the same time, the planning and zoning coordinator and development inspector will also be notified of this decision and provided with sets of approved plans. 
(12)  Step 12: initial site inspection. Upon issuance of a site development permit, a builder shall first install any required tree-save fence and erosion control facilities, and have that installation inspected and approved by the development inspector. This initial site inspection shall be done within two working days of the builder's request. Work on subsequent phases of the construction cannot proceed until this initial inspection is approved. From this point on, the development inspector shall inspect the site on a regular basis in order to assure that the development of the site is proceeding in accordance with the approved site development plan. If at any time the development inspector determines that work is not being done in accordance with the approved plan, he shall take the appropriate enforcement actions, which may include a stop work order, citations, and/or a cash bond. 
(13)  Step 13: issuance of building construction permit. Upon approval of the installation of the tree-save fencing and erosion control facilities by the development inspector, the building official may then issue a building construction permit and shall perform inspections on request at the appropriate construction intervals. These inspections shall be done within two working days of the request. If the building inspector does not approve the work requested for inspection, a reinspection fee shall be charged for a follow-up inspection. In addition to requested inspections, the building inspector may inspect a construction project at any time. 
(14)  Step 14: final building inspection. Upon completion of the structure, the builder shall request a final building inspection, which shall be performed by the building inspector within two working days of the request. There will be a charge for any required reinspection. 
(15)  Step 15: final site inspection. Upon completion of the site development work, the builder shall request a final site inspection, which shall be performed by the development inspector within two working days of the request. There will be a charge for any required reinspection. 
(16)  Step 16: final landscaping inspection. Upon completion of the landscaping work, the builder shall request a final landscaping inspection, which shall be performed by the city landscape architect within five working days of the request. There will be a charge for any required reinspection. 
(17)  Step 17: application for certificate of occupancy. Upon final approval of the structure, the site work and the landscaping, the builder may request a certificate of occupancy, which shall be issued by the building official within two working days of the request. The city landscape architect may allow a builder to defer the installation of some of the landscaping materials for climatic reasons or because of limited availability of the material at the time. In the event of a deferral, the builder must post a cash bond in accordance with section 74-39, in order to be eligible for a temporary certificate of occupancy. A temporary certificate of occupancy will be valid for a specified period of time not to exceed six months, during which time the deferred material must be installed, inspected and approved by the city landscape architect. If this is not completed within six months, the temporary certificate will be revoked and occupancy of the building must be terminated. 
(18)  Step 18: issuance of certificate of occupancy. Upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the builder may turn the property over for occupancy for its lawfully intended purpose. Under no circumstance shall a property be occupied prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. Citations may be issued and additional enforcement measures may be employed for any unauthorized occupancy. Issuance of a certificate of occupancy officially marks the end of the non-single-family residential building process.

(a)  Whenever a request is filed with the public officer by a public authority or by at least five residents of the municipality charging that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer may make an investigation or inspection of the specific dwelling, building, structure, or property and make a written report of his findings. Such officer shall be guided in his investigation by documenting conditions, which include but are not limited to:

(2)  Lack of adequate ventilation, light, or sanitary facilities;

(5)  Structural defects which render the structure unsafe for human habitation or occupancy; 
(6)  Uncleanliness; or

(b)  If the public officer's investigation or inspection identifies that any dwelling, building, structure, or property is unfit for human habitation or for commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the public officer shall file a complaint in rem in the municipal court of the city against the lot, tract, or parcel of real property on which such dwelling, building, or structure is situated or where such public health hazard or general nuisance exists and shall cause summons and a copy of the complaint to be served on the interested parties in such dwelling, building, or structure. The complaint shall identify the subject real property by appropriate street address and official tax map reference; identify the interested parties; state with particularity the factual basis for the action; and contain a statement of the action sought by the public officer to abate the alleged nuisance. The summons shall notify the interested parties that a hearing will be held before the municipal court at a date and time certain and at a place within the county or municipality where the property is located. Such hearing shall be held not less than 15 days nor more than 45 days after the filing of said complaint in the proper court. The interested parties shall have the right to file an answer to the complaint and to appear in person or by attorney and offer testimony at the time and place fixed for hearing. 
(c)  If, after such notice and hearing, the court determines that the dwelling, building, or structure in question is unfit for human habitation or is unfit for its current commercial, industrial, or business use and not in compliance with applicable codes; is vacant and being used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or constitutes an endangerment to the public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions, the court shall state, in writing, findings of fact in support of such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the interested parties that have answered the complaint or appeared at the hearing an order: 
(l)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure can be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter, or improve such dwelling, building, or structure so as to bring it into full compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violation; and, if applicable, to secure by closing the structure so that it cannot be used in connection with the commission of drug crimes; or 
(2)  If the repair, alteration, or improvement of the said dwelling, building, or structure in order to bring it into fall compliance with applicable codes relevant to the cited violations cannot be made at a reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure, requiring the owner, within the time specified in the order, to demolish and remove such dwelling, building, or structure and all debris from the property. 
    For purposes of this section, the court shall make its determination of reasonable cost in relation to the present value of the dwelling, building, or structure without consideration of the value of the land on which the structure is situated; provided, however, that costs of the preparation necessary to repair, alter, or improve a structure may be considered; and, provided further, that if the unsatisfactory condition is limited solely to the presence of graffiti, the dwelling, building or structure shall not be ordered demolished or closed, but its owner may be ordered to repair the same by cleaning or removal of the graffiti. Income and financial status of the owner shall not be a factor in the court's determination. The present value of the structure and the costs of repair, alteration, or improvement may be established by affidavits of real estate appraisers with a Georgia appraiser classification as provided in O.C.G.A. title 43, chapter 39A, qualified building contractors, or qualified building inspectors without actual testimony presented. Costs of repair, alteration, or improvement of the structure shall be the cost necessary to bring the structure into compliance with the applicable codes relevant to the cited violations in force in the jurisdiction. 
(d)  If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the public officer shall cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved, or to be vacated and closed, or demolished within 270 days of the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or any equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the 270 days in which such abatement action shall commence. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
"This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
(e)  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and governing authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials. 
(f)  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the city tax collector, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
(g)  The lien provided for in subsection (f) shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in Fulton County and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under subsection (c) of O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12. The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. After filing a certified copy of the order with the clerk of superior court, the public officer shall, within 90 days of the completion of repairs, demolition or closure, forward a copy of the order and a final statement of costs to the city tax collector. 
(h)  It shall be the duty of the city tax collector to collect the amount of the lien in conjunction with the collection of ad valorem taxes on the property and to collect the amount of the lien as if it were a real property ad valorem tax, using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically O.C.G.A. § 48-4-5; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A § 48-4-78 which requires 12 months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply; provided, further, that redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. The city tax collector may initiate enforcement of liens imposed under this section at any time following receipt of the final determination of costs from the public officer. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. 
(i)  The city tax collector shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the municipality whose ordinance is being enforced. The city tax collector may retain an amount equal to the cost of administering collection of the lien. Any such amount collected and retained for administration shall be deposited in the general fund of the county to pay the cost of administering the lien. 
(j)  The governing authority may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
(k)  Review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29.

(b)  The public officer shall cause an affidavit of service to be filed of record in the municipal court prior to the hearing showing compliance with the service requirements of this section. Such affidavit shall constitute a prima facie showing of minimum procedural due process and shall constitute sufficient proof that service was perfected. 
(c)  Orders and other filings made subsequent to service of the initial complaint shall be served in the manner provided in this section on every interested party who answers the complaint or appears at the hearing. Any interested party who fails to answer or appear at the hearing shall be deemed to have waived all further notice in the proceedings.

Examples of structural erosion and sediment control practices are riprap, sediment basins, dikes, level spreaders, waterways or outlets, diversions, grade stabilization structures and sediment traps, etc. Such practices can be found in the publication Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia. 
    Trout streams: All streams or portions of streams within the watershed as designated by the Wildlife Resources Division of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources under the provisions of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act, O.C.G.A. 12-5-20, in the rules and regulations for Water Quality Control, Chapter 391-3-6 at www.gaepd.org. Streams designated as primary trout waters are defined as water supporting a self-sustaining population of rainbow, brown or brook trout. Streams designated as secondary trout waters are those in which there is no evidence of natural trout reproduction, but are capable of supporting trout throughout the year. First order trout waters are streams into which no other streams flow except springs. 
    Vegetative erosion and sedimentation control measures: Measures for the stabilization of erodible or sediment-producing areas by covering the soil with: 
a.  Permanent seeding, sprigging or planting, producing long-term vegetative cover, or 
b.  Temporary seeding, producing short-term vegetative cover; or 
c.  Sodding, covering areas with a turf of perennial sod-forming grass. 
Such measures can be found in the publication Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia. 
    Watercourse: Any natural or artificial watercourse, stream, river, creek, channel, ditch, canal, conduit, culvert, drain, waterway, gully, ravine, or wash in which water flows either continuously or intermittently and which has a definite channel, bed and banks, and including any area adjacent thereto subject to inundation by reason of overflow or floodwater. 
    Wetlands: Those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.

(Ord. No. 2010-04, § III, 5-24-2010) 
Sec. 65-22. - Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
(a)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsection (b) and (c). The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this ordinance and the NPDES general permit. 
(b)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
(1)  Best management practices as set forth in this subsection (b) and subsection (c) shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. 12-7-6 subsection (b). 
(2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of Code Section 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
(5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in C.15. and 16., in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 (c). 
(c)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et. seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practical erosion potential; 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this subsection, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et. seq.; 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in subsection 65-22(b)(2); 
(15)  Except as provided in subsection (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-2-8, or where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this subsection. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
a.  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b.  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within 25 degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) Stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) Stream crossings for sewer lines. 
(d)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et. seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections (b) and (c). 
(e)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. 
(Ord. No. 2010-04, § IV, 5-24-2010) 
Sec. 65-23. - Application/permit process. 
(a)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
(b)  Application requirements. 
(1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of the City of Fairburn without first obtaining a permit from the engineering department to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
(2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the engineering department and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection (c). Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land-disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 65-22(b) and (c) will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by three copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
(3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. 12-7-8 half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
(4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of a district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsection 65-22(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection (b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 
(5)  If a permit applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits, this section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three years prior to the date of filing of the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
(6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, $3,000.00 per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this article or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
(c)  Plan requirements. 
(1)  Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsection 65-22(b) and (c), or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, is hereby incorporated by reference into this article. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-20. 
(2)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate Erosion, Sedimentation and Pollution Control Plan Review Checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
(d)  Permits. 
(1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than 45 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
(2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this article, any variances required by subsection 65-22(c)(15) and (16) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection (b)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
(3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this article, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
(4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
(5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this article. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
(6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. 12-7-7(f)(1). 
(Ord. No. 2010-04, § V, 5-24-2010) 
Sec. 65-24. - Inspection and enforcement. 
(a)  The inspections and enforcement department will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate both primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
(b)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
(c)  The engineering, inspections and enforcement departments shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
(d)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
(e)  The districts or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8 (a). The districts or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The districts or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
(f)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to [O.C.G.A.] Code Section 12-7-8 (a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-8 (a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-7 (e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority. 
(Ord. No. 2010-04, § VI, 5-24-2010) 
Sec. 65-25. - Penalties and incentives. 
(a)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
(b)  Stop-work orders. 
(1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
(2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and; 
(3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred.

ARTICLE III. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 65-56. - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of this article is to protect, maintain and enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased postdevelopment stormwater runoff and non-point source pollution associated with new development and redevelopment. It has been determined that proper management of postdevelopment stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety, environment and general welfare of the public, and protect water and aquatic resources. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
(1)  Establish decision-making processes surrounding land development activities that protect the integrity of the watershed and preserve the health of water resources; 
(2)  Require that new development and redevelopment maintain the predevelopment hydrologic response in their postdevelopment state as nearly as practicable in order to reduce flooding, streambank and channel erosion, non-point source pollution and increases in stream temperature, and maintain the integrity of stream channels and aquatic habitats; 
(3)  Establish minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control of stormwater runoff quantity and quality; 
(4)  Establish design and application criteria for the construction and use of structural stormwater control facilities that can be used to meet the minimum postdevelopment stormwater management standards; 
(5)  Encourage the use of nonstructural stormwater management and stormwater better site design practices, such as the preservation of greenspace and other conservation areas, to the maximum extent practicable. Coordinate site design plans, which include greenspace, with the city's greenspace protection plan; 
(6)  Establish provisions for the long-term responsibility for and maintenance of structural stormwater control facilities and nonstructural stormwater management practices to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained, and pose no threat to public safety; and 
(7)  Establish administrative procedures for the submission, review, approval and dis-approval of stormwater management plans, and for the inspection of approved active projects, and long-term follow up.

ARTICLE IV. - STORMWATER UTILITY 

Sec. 65-195. - Findings. 
    The city council makes the following findings: 
(1)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the corporate limits of the city. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the corporate limits of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
(2)  The stormwater needs in the city include, but are not limited to, protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. Provision of stormwater management programs and facilities renders and/or results in both a service and a benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the city in a variety of ways as described in the professional engineering and financial analysis. The service and benefit rendered, or resulting from provision of stormwater management systems and facilities, may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including but not limited to location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs, and risk exposure. 
(3)  The city presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities, which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems owned and operated by the city, and the additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city. In order to do so, the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for its program operational and capital improvement needs. 
(4)  The professional engineering and financing analysis, known as the Stormwater Utility Implementation Report, prepared by the city's consulting stormwater engineer, properly assesses and defines the city's stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities as well as the stormwater management program funding strategy. 
(5)  Given the stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and funding strategy identified in the professional engineering and financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater management systems within the city in concert with other water resource management programs. 
(6)  The city council finds, concludes and determines that a stormwater utility provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering and funding stormwater management services in the city. 
(7)  An equitable approach to funding stormwater management services and facilities can be provided by adopting a schedule of stormwater user fee charges upon properties that is related to the burden of stormwater quality and/or quantity control service requirements and costs posed by properties throughout the city. Such a schedule of user fee charges can be supplemented by other funding sources/methods to address specific needs, including, but not limited to, allocations from the general fund. Based on the recommended funding strategy, it is most equitable that a portion of the needed stormwater management services continue to be funded from the city's general fund tax revenues, and therefore that the city council may allocate general fund tax revenues to support the stormwater management program in the future in the form of a combination of user fee charge payments for city-owned properties and supplemental allocation from the general fund. In addition, the city may utilize and allocate other supplemental funding sources/methods to address specific stormwater management program requirements, including but not limited to, development review and inspection fees, special purpose local option sales taxes (SPLOST), revenue bonds, loans, and any other supplemental funding sources that can be appropriately utilized to fund the city's comprehensive stormwater management program. 
(8)  A credit to the stormwater user fee charge is an appropriate means of adjusting the user fee charge in recognition of the specific efforts, and associated costs, undertaken by qualified private properties and their stormwater management control systems that effectively reduce the burden of stormwater runoff quantity and/or quality impacts from private property that the city would have to otherwise manage at its own cost and expense. Mitigation of stormwater runoff impacts is accomplished by properly designing, constructing and maintaining stormwater controls that reduce the impact that land development activities and impervious surfaces have on the city's drainage system. 
(Ord. No. 2005-10, § 1(25-75), 5-16-2005) 
Sec. 65-196. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Attached residential dwelling property means developed land containing attached dwelling units such as duplexes, triplexes, quadruplexes, apartments, condominiums, townhouses, or other residential structures not listed herein where two or more family groups commonly and normally reside or could reside. Developed land may be classified as an attached residential dwelling property despite the presence of incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports and small storage buildings. Developed land may be classified as an attached residential dwelling property despite the presence of a commercial use. The term "attached residential dwelling property" shall not include developed land containing structures used primarily for nonresidential purposes, hotels, motels, retirement centers, nursing homes and assisted living home. 
    Credit means a conditional reduction in the amount of a stormwater use fee charge to an individual property based on the provision and continuing presence of an effectively maintained and operational on-site stormwater management system, or facility, or the provision of a service or activity by a property owner, whereby the stormwater control system, facility, service or activity reduces the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater services and facilities for that property. Credits for on-site stormwater systems shall be generally proportional to the effect that such systems have on mitigating the runoff characteristics from a property, in whole or in part, including peak discharge rate, runoff volume, runoff velocity and pollutant discharge. 
    Customers of the stormwater utility includes all persons, properties, and entities serviced by and/or benefiting from the stormwater utility. This benefit includes, but is not limited to, the stormwater utility's administration, management, maintenance, expansion, and improvement of the public stormwater management systems for the handling of stormwater runoff of private and public properties, and the regulation of the public and private stormwater management systems, controls, facilities, and activities. 
    Detached residential dwelling property means developed land containing one detached dwelling unit, including residential homes, manufactured homes and mobile homes on individual lots. Developed land may be classified as a detached residential dwelling property despite the presence of incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports and small storage buildings. Developed land may be classified as a residential dwelling property despite the presence of a commercial use within the dwelling unit so long as such use does not result in additional impervious areas, such as parking spaces, playgrounds, or additions to the building which are used as offices, meeting rooms, classrooms, houses of worship or similar nonresidential uses. The term "detached residential dwelling property" shall not include developed land containing structures used primarily for nonresidential purposes, hotels, motels, retirement centers, nursing homes and assisted living homes. Detached residential dwelling property is sometimes referred to as single-family residential (SFR) property within the city's stormwater utility literature and documents. 
    Developed land means all property altered from its natural undeveloped condition by the construction or installation of 1,000 or more square feet of impervious surface. 
    Dwelling unit shall mean a structure, which contains one or more bedrooms, a bathroom and a kitchen facility. 
    Equivalent runoff unit (ERU) means the median area of impervious surface established in residential dwelling properties in the city as determined by the city's consulting stormwater engineer, and shall be used as the basis for determining stormwater user fee charges to residential dwelling properties, and other developed properties. Three thousand three hundred square feet of impervious surface shall be one equivalent runoff unit (ERU). 
    Hydrologic response, when applied to a parcel of property, means the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from the property. Hydrologic response is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious surface, the parcel's size, the parcel's shape, the parcel's vegetative canopy, the parcel's groundwater, the parcel's antecedent moisture and the parcel's geologic condition. 
    Impervious surface means the area that prevents or impedes the infiltration of rainfall or stormwater runoff into the soil as the water would have infiltrated under natural conditions prior to the parcel's development. Typical areas include, but are not limited to, rooftops, sidewalks, walkways, swimming pools, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, awnings and other manmade surfaces which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of rainfall or stormwater runoff. 
    Occupant means the individual residing or conducting business on the property. In a family or household circumstance, the individual responsible for the obligation imposed by this article shall be the adult head of the household. In a commercial circumstance, the adult legally responsible for the management or condition of the property shall be responsible for the obligation imposed by this article. 
    Other developed properties includes all property not defined as residential dwelling property, including but not limited to, commercial and office buildings, shopping and retail centers, public buildings and structures, gasoline stations, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas covered with impervious surfaces, parking lots, parks, recreation properties, public and private educational facilities, hospitals, convalescent centers, hotels, motels, retirement centers, nursing homes, assisted living homes, commercial uses, industrial uses, institutional uses and agricultural uses covered by impervious surfaces. Other developed properties is sometimes referred to as non-single-family residential (NSFR) property within the city's stormwater utility literature and documents. 
    Owner means the legal owner of record as shown on the tax records of the county except where there is a recorded land sale contract, the purchaser thereunder shall be deemed the owner. 
    Stormwater management services means all services provided by the city, which mean the following: 
(1)  Transfer, control, conveyance or movement of stormwater runoff through the city; 
(2)  Maintenance, repair and replacement of existing stormwater management systems and facilities; 
(3)  Planning, development, design and construction of additional stormwater management systems and facilities to meet current and anticipated needs; 
(4)  Regulation of the use of stormwater management services, systems and facilities; and 
(5)  Education of the public as to the stormwater issues. 
    Stormwater management systems means systems which address the issues of drainage conveyance, flood control and water quality management (pollutant discharge and erosion and sedimentation control) of receiving rivers, streams, creeks, lakes, ponds and reservoirs. Stormwater management systems address these issues through improving, maintaining, regulating and funding the necessary instrumentalities used in the collection, conveyance, retention, detention, and treatment of stormwater runoff or surface water drainage. 
    Stormwater user fee charges means the periodic rate, fee or charge applicable to a parcel of developed land, which charge shall be reflective of the service provided by the stormwater utility. Stormwater user fee charges are based on measurable parameters, which influence the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities, with the most important factor being the amount of impervious surface on each parcel of developed land. The use of impervious surface as the user fee charge rate parameter shall not preclude the use of other parameters, or the grouping of properties having similar characteristics through the use of ranges, or rounding to a consistent numerical interval, or the use of flat rate charges for one or more classes, or similarly situated properties, whose impact on the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities is relatively consistent. Stormwater user fee charges may also include special charges to the owners of particular properties for services or facilities uniquely related to stormwater management, including, but not limited to, charges for development plan review, the inspection of development projects, the inspection of on-site stormwater control systems and enhanced levels of stormwater management services above those normally provided by the stormwater utility. 
    Undeveloped land means land in its unaltered natural condition or which is modified to such a minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural condition shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have minimal impervious surface, which impedes the infiltration of stormwater runoff or causes stormwater runoff to collect, concentrate or flow in a manner materially different from what would occur if the land were in an unaltered natural condition. For purposes of this article, the term "undeveloped land" includes property altered from its natural condition by the creation or installation of less than 1,000 square feet of impervious surface. 
    User means any person who uses property, which maintains connection to, discharges to, or otherwise receives services from the city for stormwater management. The occupant of any habitable property is deemed the user. If the property is not occupied, then the owner shall be deemed the user. 
(Ord. No. 2005-10, § 1(25-77), 5-16-2005) 
Sec. 65-197. - Establishment of a stormwater utility. 
(a)  The city hereby establishes a stormwater utility within the city, which shall serve as the organizational and accounting entity for the city's stormwater management program. The stormwater utility shall provide for the management, protection, control, regulation, use and enhancement of stormwater quantity and quality controls, systems and facilities. The stormwater utility shall be under the operational direction of the city administrator. The corporate limits of the city, as increased from time to time, shall constitute the boundaries of the stormwater utility's service district. 
(b)  The city shall amend the existing Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund to include a stormwater utility function within the existing enterprise fund. The stormwater utility shall be established and defined within the city budget and accounting systems, separate and apart from the general fund and the water and sewer function of the resulting enterprise fund, for the purpose of dedicating and protecting all funding applicable to the purposes and responsibilities of the stormwater utility. All revenues and receipts of the stormwater utility shall be deposited promptly upon receipt into the Water, Sewer and Stormwater Utility Enterprise Fund, with the stormwater utility fund revenues to be held and invested in trust for the purposes of the stormwater utility, including, but not limited to operational actions, capital project construction, regulatory compliance, and/or repayment of revenue bonds used to fund capital projects. 
(Ord. No. 2005-10, § 1(25-76), 5-16-2005) 
Sec. 65-198. - Scope of responsibility for the stormwater management system. 
(a)  The city stormwater management system consists of all city streets, curbs and gutters, rivers, streams, creeks, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, drainageways, channels, ditches, swales, storm sewers, culverts, inlets, catchbasins, pipes, head walls and other structures, natural or manmade, within the political boundaries of the city which control and/or intentionally diverts stormwater runoff, or surface waters, from its public streets as well as public and private properties. The city owns or has legal access for purposes of operation, maintenance and improvements to those segments of the city stormwater management system which are: 
(1)  Located on public property or within public streets, rights-of-way and easements; 
(2)  The segments which are subject to easements, rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use or other permanent provisions for adequate access for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of stormwater management systems and facilities; or 
(3)  Located on public lands to which the city has adequate access for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of systems and facilities. 
Operation and maintenance of stormwater systems and facilities which are located on private property or public property not owned by the city and for which there has been no public dedication of such systems and facilities for operation, maintenance, and/or improvement of the systems and facilities shall be remain the legal responsibility of the property owner, or its occupant, except as that responsibility may be otherwise affected by the laws of the state and the United States of America. 
(b)  It is the intent of this article to protect the public health, safety and general welfare of all properties and persons in general, but not to create any special duty or relationship with an individual person, or to any specified property, within or without the boundaries of the city. The city expressly reserves the right to assert all available immunities and defenses in any action seeking to impose monetary damages upon the city, its officers, employees and agents arising out of any alleged failure or breach of duty or relationship as may now exist or hereafter be created. To the extent any permit approval, inspection, or similar act is required by the city as a condition precedent to any activity by, or upon property, not owned by the city, pursuant to any other regulatory ordinance, the issuance of such permit, plan approval, or inspection shall not be deemed to constitute a warranty, express or implied, nor shall it afford the basis for any action, including any action based on failure to permit or negligent issuance of a permit, seeking the imposition of money damages against the city, its officers, employees or agents. 
(Ord. No. 2005-10, § 1(25-78), 5-16-2005) 
Sec. 65-199. - Stormwater user fee charges-Determination and modification. 
    Stormwater user fee charges shall be determined and modified from time to time by action of the city council. In setting or modifying such user fee rates, it shall be the objective of the city council to establish rates, fees and charges that are fair, equitable and reflect the value of stormwater management services and facilities relative to the benefit derived by the properties. Stormwater user fee charges shall be sufficient to meet the cost of implementing the identified components and activities of the city's stormwater management program. 
(Ord. No. 2005-10, § 1(25-79), 5-16-2005) 
Sec. 65-200. - Same-Applicability of exemptions and credits; enforcement methods and inspections. 
(a)  Except as provided in this section, no public or private property shall be exempt from the stormwater utility user fee charges. No exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in stormwater user fee charges shall be granted based on age, tax status, economic status, race, religion or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities. A stormwater utility user fee charge Credit Technical Manual (hereafter referred to as the credit manual) has been prepared by the city's consulting stormwater engineer specifying the design and performance standards of on-site stormwater management controls, systems, facilities, activities, and services which qualify for application of a stormwater user fee charge credit, how such credits shall be calculated and how such credits can be maintained by the customer. This credit manual has been separately approved by the city council and, by reference, incorporated into this section. Any amendments to such credit manual in the future, which are approved by the city council, shall also be incorporated into this section by reference. 
(1)  Undeveloped land shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. 
(2)  Railroad rights-of-way (tracks) shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. However, railroad stations, maintenance buildings, and/or other developed land used for railroad purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. 
(3)  Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) streets and rights-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance and capital construction services undertaken by GDOT in association with GDOT rights-of-way and road systems. However, maintenance buildings and/or other developed land used for GDOT purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. 
(4)  A stormwater user fee charge credit shall be determined based on the technical requirements, standards and criteria contained in the credit manual. The amount of credit, or reduction of the stormwater user fee charge, shall be in accordance with the criteria contained in the credit manual. 
(5)  Any credit allowed against the stormwater user fee charge is conditioned on continuing compliance with the city's design and performance standards as stated in the credit manual and/or upon continuing provision of the controls, systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner or owners upon which the credit is based. The city may revoke a credit at any time for noncompliance with applicable standards and criteria as established in the credit manual. 
(b)  All property owners of developed real property within the city shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater management systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, and discharge stormwater runoff in a safe manner consistent with all city development regulations, ordinances and the laws of the state and the United States of America. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a nuisance and be subject to an abatement action filed by the city in the municipal court. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the property owner fails to abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the court, the city may enter upon the property and cause work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual cost thereof assessed against the property owner in the same manner as a tax levied against the property. From the date of the filing of such action, the city shall have lien rights which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the superior court of the county. The city shall have the right, pursuant to the authority of this article, for its designated officers and employees to enter upon private property and public property owned by entities other than the city, upon reasonable notice to the owner thereof, to inspect the property and conduct surveys and engineering tests thereon in order to assure compliance with applicable city development regulations and ordinances. 
(Ord. No. 2005-10, § 1(25-80), 5-16-2005) 
Sec. 65-201. - Same-Initial billing period; ERU standards; collection and liability of payment. 
(a)  Stormwater user fee charges shall be billed starting with the first billing cycle in July 2005, except as specific exemptions and credits may apply. 
(b)  The following ERU standards shall apply: 
(1)  Stormwater user fee charges are based upon the number of ERUs, or increment thereof, associated with developed land. The user fee charge per ERU shall be determined and modified from time to time by resolution of the city council and as set forth in the city's established fee schedule. 
(2)  Detached residential dwelling properties. Each detached residential dwelling property, as defined herein, shall be charged a stormwater user fee of one ERU per month. 
(3)  Attached residential dwelling properties. All attached residential dwelling properties as defined herein shall be charged the rate applicable to one ERU times the number of dwelling units located on the property (ERU total ) times an adjustment factor (AF). The adjustment factor (AF) has been determined to be 0.45. For each monthly user fee charge billing, the ERU total figure will be multiplied by the adjustment factor (AF) which adjusts the ERU total to equal the median impervious surface of a statistical comparison of attached residential dwelling properties versus detached residential dwelling properties in the city. Therefore, each attached residential dwelling unit will be charged a stormwater user fee of 0.45 ERU per dwelling unit per month. 
(4)  Other developed properties. All developed land not classified as a residential dwelling property shall be billed one ERU for every 3,300 square foot increment of impervious surface. In cases where a fractional ERU is calculated, the total ERU for the customer account will be rounded down to the next whole number for billing. Increments of impervious surface less than 3,300 square feet shall not be billable except in the case of minimum bills (i.e., 1,000 to 3,299 square feet of impervious surface), which shall be billed at the rate for one ERU. For customers located within a development with shared common parking or other impervious surface, the amount of shared common impervious surface associated with the developed land shall be apportioned to the individual customer by a percentage of the impervious surface attributable to the customer as determined by the total common shared impervious surface times the percentage of the customer's square feet of leased, or owned, interior or exterior space to the total square feet within the development of interior, or exterior, space available for occupancy. 
(c)  The customer of the stormwater utility shall be billed for the stormwater user fee charges. The stormwater user fee charge may be billed on a common statement and collected along with other city public utility charges. The customer may be the occupant, owner or user who is billed by the city for public services (i.e., water, sewer, electricity, sanitation, and/or cable services). If the developed land does not receive any other city public utility services, or is not being charged for public utility services due to vacancy, or non-use, at the time of stormwater user fee billing, then the owner of the property shall be billed for stormwater management services by the city. Regardless of whether or not the developed land has an occupant or user, the owner is ultimately responsible for payment of the stormwater user fee charges. 
(Ord. No. 2005-10, § 1(25-81), 5-16-2005) 
Sec. 65-202. - Same-Billing, delinquencies, collections. 
(a)  Failure to receive a stormwater user fee bill is not justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each parcel of developed land, as shown from public land records of the county, shall be ultimately obligated to pay such stormwater user fee charge. If a customer or owner is under billed, or if no bill is sent for developed land, the city may back bill the customer for a period of up to three years, subject to the penalties for such delinquency set forth in section 59-1. The stormwater user fee may be included in the bill for other city utilities as set forth in section 59-1. 
(b)  Unpaid stormwater user fee charges shall be collected by filing suit to collect on an unpaid account by using all methods allowed by state law to collect on any judgment obtained thereby, including enforcement of any lien resulting from any such judgment. In no instance shall the unpaid stormwater user fee charge constitute a direct lien against the property. 
(Ord. No. 2005-10, § 1(25-82), 5-16-2005) 
Sec. 65-203. - Appeals. 
    Any person who can show that the impervious surface allocated to such person's property is in error may appeal in the following manner: 
(1)  An appeal shall be filed in writing with the city administrator using the process outlined in this section. The initial appeal can be undertaken by having the customer request that the city review the customer account data to confirm the accuracy of the customer's bill. If the customer account data does not indicate an error, the customer can present a detailed survey of the parcel, the associated impervious surface data and any other features or conditions which influence the hydrologic response of the property to rainfall events and stormwater runoff. The survey shall be prepared by a registered land surveyor or professional engineer. 
(2)  Using the information provided by the appellant, the city administrator may conduct a technical review of the conditions on the property and respond to the appeal in writing within 60 days. 
(3)  In response to an appeal, the city administrator may adjust the stormwater user fee charge applicable to the property in conformance with the general purpose and intent of this article. 
(4)  There shall be no further administrative appeal beyond the city administrator.

(Ord. No. 2004-17, app. E(3), 12-13-2004) 
Sec. 65-232. - Applicability. 
    This article shall apply to all land development activity on property containing a stream protection area. These requirements are in addition to, and do not replace or supersede, any other applicable buffer requirements established under state law, and approval or exemption from these requirements do not constitute approval or exemption from buffer requirements established under state law or from other applicable local, state or federal regulations. 
(1)  Grandfather provisions. This article shall not apply to the following activities: 
a.  Work consisting of the repair or maintenance of any lawful use of land that is zoned and approved for such use on or before the effective date of the ordinance from which this article was derived. 
b.  Existing development and ongoing land disturbance activities, including but not limited to existing agriculture, silviculture, landscaping, gardening and lawn maintenance, except that new development or land disturbance activities on such properties will be subject to all applicable buffer requirements. 
c.  Any land development activity that is under construction, fully approved for development, scheduled for permit approval or has been submitted for approval as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived. 
d.  Land development activity that has not been submitted for approval, but that is part of a larger master development plan, such as for an office park or other phased development that has been previously approved within two years of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived. 
(2)  Exemptions. 
a.  The following specific activities are exempt from this article. Exemption of these activities does not constitute an exemption for any other activity proposed on a property.

2.  Public sewer line easements paralleling the creek, except that all easements (permanent and construction) and land disturbance should be at least 25 feet from the top of the bank. This includes such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including but not limited to manholes, vents and valve structures. This exemption shall not be construed as allowing the construction of roads, bike paths or other transportation routes in such easements, regardless of paving material, except for access for the uses specifically cited in subsection (2)a.1 of this section. 
3.  Land development activities within a right-of-way existing at the time the ordinance from which this article is derived takes effect or is approved under the terms of this article. 
4.  Within an easement of any utility existing at the time the ordinance from which this article is derived takes effect or is approved under the terms of this article, land disturbance activities and such impervious cover as is necessary for the operation and maintenance of the utility, including but not limited to manholes, vents and valve structures. 
5.  Emergency work necessary to preserve life or property. However, when emergency work is performed under this section, the person performing it shall report such work to the city on the next business day after commencement of the work. Within ten days thereafter, the person shall apply for a permit and perform such work within such time period as may be determined by the city to be reasonably necessary to correct any impairment such emergency work may have caused to the water conveyance capacity, stability or water quality of the protection area. 
6.  Forestry and silviculture activities on land that is zoned for forestry, silvicultural or agricultural uses and are not incidental to other land development activity. If such activity results in land disturbance in the buffer that would otherwise be prohibited, then no other land disturbing activity other than normal forest management practices will be allowed on the entire property for three years after the end of the activities that intruded on the buffer. 
b.  Any land development activity within a buffer established hereunder or any impervious cover within a setback established hereunder is prohibited unless a variance is granted pursuant to section 65-233(b). 
(Ord. No. 2004-17, app. E(4), 12-13-2004) 
Sec. 65-233. - Land development requirements. 
(a)  Buffer and setback requirements. All land development activity subject to this article shall meet the following requirements: 
(1)  An undisturbed natural vegetative buffer shall be maintained for 50 feet, measured horizontally, on both banks (as applicable) of the stream as measured from the top of the stream bank. 
(2)  An additional setback shall be maintained for 25 feet, measured horizontally, beyond the undisturbed natural vegetative buffer, in which all impervious cover shall be prohibited. Grading, filling and earthmoving shall be minimized within the setback. 
(3)  No septic tanks or septic tank drainfields shall be permitted within the buffer or the setback. 
(b)  Variance procedures. Variances from the above buffer and setback requirements may be granted in accordance with the following provisions: 
(1)  Where a parcel was platted prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article was derived, and its shape, topography or other existing physical condition prevents land development consistent with this article, and the city administrator finds and determines that the requirements of this article prohibit the otherwise lawful use of the property by the owner, the city board of zoning appeals may grant a variance from the buffer and setback requirements hereunder, provided such variance require mitigation measures to offset the effects of any proposed land development on the parcel. 
(2)  Except as provided in subsection (b)(1) of this section, the board of zoning appeals shall grant no variance from any provision of this article without first conducting a public hearing on the application for variance and authorizing the granting of the variance by an affirmative vote of the board of zoning appeals. The city shall give public notice of each such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. The city shall require that the applicant post a sign giving notice of the proposed variance and the public hearing. The sign shall be of a size and posted in such a location on the property as to be clearly visible from the primary adjacent road right-of-way. Variances will be considered only in the following cases: 
a.  When a property's shape, topography or other physical conditions existing at the time of the adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived prevents land development unless a buffer variance is granted. 
b.  Unusual circumstances when strict adherence to the minimal buffer requirements in the article would create an extreme hardship. 
Variances will not be considered when, following adoption of the ordinance from which this article is derived, actions of any property owner of a given property have created conditions of a hardship on that property. 
(3)  At a minimum, a variance request shall include the following information: 
a.  A site map that includes locations of all streams, wetlands, floodplain boundaries and other natural features, as determined by field survey; 
b.  A description of the shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
c.  A detailed site plan that shows the locations of all existing and proposed structures and other impervious cover, the limits of all existing and proposed land disturbance, both inside and outside the buffer and setback. The exact area of the buffer to be affected shall be accurately and clearly indicated; 
d.  Documentation of unusual hardship should the buffer be maintained; 
e.  At least one alternative plan, which does not include a buffer or setback intrusion, or an explanation of why such a site plan is not possible; 
f.  A calculation of the total area and length of the proposed intrusion; 
g.  A stormwater management site plan, if applicable; and 
h.  Proposed mitigation, if any, for the intrusion. If no mitigation is proposed, the request must include an explanation of why none is being proposed. 
(4)  The following factors will be considered in determining whether to issue a variance: 
a.  The shape, size, topography, slope, soils, vegetation and other physical characteristics of the property; 
b.  The locations of all streams on the property, including along property boundaries; 
c.  The location and extent of the proposed buffer or setback intrusion; 
d.  Whether alternative designs are possible which require less intrusion or no intrusion; 
e.  The long-term and construction water quality impacts of the proposed variance; and 
f.  Whether issuance of the variance is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment.

(4)  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Regulatory flood means the flood standard equal to or higher than the base flood. The regulatory flood is defined as the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, assuming the drainage basin is fully developed as shown on the current land use plan. Only structural stormwater control facilities that can be shown will remain (i.e., owned by the city) and that are large enough to be included in the hydrograph routings shall be considered when determining the flood peak. 
    Regulatory flood elevation means the flood standard equal to or higher than the base flood elevation. The regulatory flood elevation is defined as the highest water surface anticipated at any given point during the regulatory flood. 
    Site means the parcel of land being developed, or the portion thereof on which the land development project is located. 
    Start of construction means the date the permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (Note: accessory structures are not exempt from any chapter requirements.) For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement. 
(1)  The term "substantial improvement" means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a building, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the improvement. The market value of the building means: 
a.  The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement; or 
b.  In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. 
(2)  The term "substantial improvement" includes structures that have incurred substantial damage regardless of the actual amount of repair work performed. For the purposes of this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. The term does not, however, include those improvements of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to ensure safe living conditions, which have been pre-identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project. 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home park or subdivision means where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced. 
    Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this article that permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this article. 
(Ord. No. 2004-17, app. F(2), 12-13-2004) 
Sec. 68-26. - Variance procedures. 
(a)  The board of zoning appeals as established by the city shall hear and decide requests for appeals or variance from the requirements of this article. 
(b)  The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is made by the city administrator in the enforcement or administration of this article. 
(c)  Any person aggrieved by the decision of the board of zoning appeals may appeal such decision to the municipal court. 
(d)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(e)  Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this article are met, no reasonable alternative exists, and the development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety. 
(f)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(g)  In reviewing such requests, the board of zoning appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant factors, and all standards specified in this section and other sections of this article. 
(h)  Conditions for variances are as follows: 
(1)  A variance shall be issued only when there is: 
a.  A finding of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
c.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, or cause fraud on or victimization of the public. 
(2)  The provisions of this article are minimum standards for flood loss reduction, therefore any deviation from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and, in the instance of an historic structure, a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(3)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation of the proposed lowest floor and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk to life and property resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(4)  The city administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(i)  Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this article, the board of zoning appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article.

DIVISION 3. - STANDARDS FOR LAND DEVELOPMENT 

Sec. 68-81. - Floodplain boundaries. 
(a)  Studied "A" zones, as identified in the FIS, shall be used to establish base flood elevations whenever available. 
(b)  For special flood hazards areas and floodprone areas, the regulatory flood elevations shall be determined by a registered professional engineer using a method approved by the city. 
(c)  The boundaries or limits of the floodplain shall be within 0.5 foot vertical accuracy on the site plan containing existing topographic information. 
(Ord. No. 2004-17, app. F(4.1), 12-13-2004) 
Sec. 68-82. - Floodway boundaries. 
(a)  The width of a floodway shall be determined from the FIS or FEMA-approved flood study. 
(b)  Following a pre-design conference with the city, the boundaries or limits of the floodway shall be shown on the (development or stormwater) site plan containing existing topographic information. 
(Ord. No. 2004-17, app. F(4.2), 12-13-2004) 
Sec. 68-83. - General standards. 
(a)  No construction or structures, including grading, filling, cutting or displacement of earth, shall be allowed within the area bounded by the base flood as established by FEMA and shown on the FIRM. 
(b)  No construction or structures, including grading, filling, cutting or displacement of earth, shall be allowed between the regulatory and base floodplain that could result in any of the following: 
(1)  Raising the regulatory flood elevation beyond the boundaries of the ownership of the property being developed unless contained in a drainage easement obtained by the developer; 
(2)  Reducing the regulatory flood storage capacity. All compensation for storage capacity shall occur either within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed, or within a permanent, recorded flood control easement, or shall be within a reasonable proximity to the location of the encroachment. Acceptable means of providing required compensation include: lowering of natural ground elevations within the floodplain; lowering of adjoining land areas to create additional floodplain; or raising of the regulatory flood elevation within the boundaries of ownership of the property being developed. All cut areas are to be graded to a slope of no less than 1.0 percent. In no case shall any required compensation be provided via bottom storage or by excavating below the elevation of the top of the natural (predevelopment) stream channel unless such excavation results from the widening or relocation of the stream channel. A step-backwater analysis will be required to determine the volume of flood storage created by raising the regulatory flood elevation; 
(3)  Changing the flow characteristics of the waters of the regulatory flood as they pass both the upstream and the downstream boundaries of the property. Verification shall be provided via a step-backwater analysis; or 
(4)  Creating hazardous or erosion-producing velocities, or resulting in excessive sedimentation. In all cases, effective transitions must be provided such that flow velocities occurring on both upstream and downstream properties are not increased or decreased. 
(c)  All proposed development shall have public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
(d)  Any significant changes or revisions to the flood data adopted herein and shown on the FIRM shall be submitted as a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable. The CLOMR submittal shall be subject to approval by the city using the community consent forms before forwarding the submittal package to FEMA for final approval. The responsibility for forwarding the CLOMR to FEMA and for obtaining the CLOMR approval shall be the responsibility of the applicant. Within six months of the completion of construction, the applicant shall submit as-built surveys that demonstrate general conformance to the approved designs as submitted in the CLOMR application. A letter of map revision (LOMR) or letter of map amendment (LOMA) must be issued before the final plat can be approved or a certificate of occupancy can be issued. Significant changes or revisions shall be defined as any change to the FIRM easily observed when plotted at a scale of one inch equals 1,000 feet. The changes or revisions may be due to, but are not limited to, more current and/or superior topographic information or compensatory cut and fill grading done as a part of the development. 
(Ord. No. 2004-17, app. F(4.3), 12-13-2004) 
Sec. 68-84. - Engineering study requirements for floodplain encroachments. 
    An engineering study is required, as appropriate to the proposed development activities on the site, whenever a development proposes to disturb the regulatory floodplain. This study shall be prepared by a currently registered professional engineer in the state and made a part of the application for a permit. This information shall be submitted to and approved by the city prior to the approval of any permit that would authorize the disturbance of land located within the floodplain. Such study shall include: 
(1)  Description of the extent to which any watercourse or floodplain will be altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development; 
(2)  Step-backwater analysis, using a method approved by the city. Cross sections (which may be supplemented by the applicant) and flow information will be obtained whenever available. Computations will be shown duplicating FIS results and will then be rerun with the proposed modifications to determine the new base flood and regulatory flood profiles; 
(3)  Floodplain storage calculations based on cross sections (at least one every 100 feet) showing existing and proposed floodplain conditions to show that regulatory floodplain storage capacity would not be diminished by the development; 
(4)  If changes to the regulatory flood elevation are proposed, profiles of the channel showing the existing and proposed regulatory flood elevations must be provided; and 
(5)  The study shall include a preliminary plat, grading plan, or site plan, as appropriate, which shall clearly define all floodplain encroachments. 
(Ord. No. 2004-17, app. F(4.4), 12-13-2004) 
Sec. 68-85. - Floodway encroachments. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as floodways. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, floodways must remain free of encroachment in order to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1)  Encroachments are prohibited, including earthen fill, new construction, substantial improvements or other development within the regulatory floodway, except when required for the construction of bridges, culverts, roadways and utilities, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase to the pre-project base flood elevations, floodway elevations, or floodway widths during the regulatory or base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certification thereof; and 
(2)  If the applicant proposes to revise the floodway boundaries, no permit authorizing the encroachment into or an alteration of the floodway shall be issued by the city until an affirmative conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) or conditional letter of map amendment (CLOMA), whichever is applicable, is issued by FEMA.

Sec. 71-591. - Field quality control. 
(a)  General leakage requirements. To conform to general leakage requirements, contractors shall do the following: 
(1)  Make the entire sewer line system as near watertight as practicable. Eliminate all visible points of groundwater infiltration, and any other significant points of leakage which can be located, regardless of test results obtained as hereinafter required. 
(2)  Upon completion of pipe installation and trench backfilling to within one foot of finished grade, perform system installation acceptance tests using infiltration or exfiltration testing, or piping or joint low pressure air testing for all work constructed. Conduct final acceptance test witnessed by the city. 
(3)  Installation acceptance testing is required on all new sewer line segments extending completely from manhole to manhole unless waived by the city due to unreasonable service shutdown demands. 
(4)  An acceptable low pressure air test is interpreted as an installation acceptance test in lieu of infiltration or exfiltration testing of pipelines. 
(5)  Take whatever action may be necessary to permanently reduce infiltration from all water sources to less than the maximum allowable leakage limits established below for all constructed work. 
(b)  System exfiltration or infiltration acceptance testing. Infiltration testing is only applicable if the groundwater table is at least two feet above the crown of the new sewer pipeline being tested. Exfiltration testing will be used when the groundwater table is less than two feet above the crown of the new sewer. Contractors shall perform infiltration or exfiltration acceptance testing only as permitted by the city. 
(c)  System exfiltration testing. Contractors shall perform system exfiltration acceptance testing in accordance with ASTM C 1091 or ASTM C 969 guidelines for new sewers. The maximum allowable leakage is 50 gallons/(inch of internal diameter)(mile of sewer)(day) when the average head of the test section is three feet or less. When the average head on the test section is greater than three feet, the allowable leakage shall be multiplied by the ratio of the square root of the average test head over the square foot of the base head of three feet. 
(d)  System infiltration testing. Contractors shall perform system infiltration testing in accordance with ASTM C 1091 or ASTM C 969 guidelines for new sewers. The maximum allowable leakage limit is 50 gallons/(inch of internal diameter)(mile of sewer)(day) when the average head on the test section is six feet or less. When the average groundwater head on the test section is greater than six feet, the allowable leakage shall be increased in proportion to the ratio of the square root of the average groundwater head over the square root of the base head of six feet. 
(e)  Air testing. Air testing regulations shall be as follows: 
(1)  For nominal four-inch to 24-inch pipe: 
a.  After completing backfill of a sewer line section, contractors shall conduct a low pressure air test depending on pipe material in accordance with ASTM C 924, ASTM C 828, ASTM F 1417, or UNI-B-6 guidelines for installation acceptance. Ductile iron pipelines shall be tested in accordance with ASTM F 1417 or UNI-B-6 requirements. Contractors shall perform such tests using the following general procedures: 
1.  Temporarily plug line segment between two manholes using plugs having airtight fittings through which low pressure air can be introduced into the pipe segment being tested. 
2.  Introduce low-pressure air into the test pipe segment until the internal air pressure reaches 4.0 psig above groundwater pressure, if any. 
3.  Wait at least two minutes for air temperature in the test segment to stabilize while internal air pressure remains no less than 3.5 psig above groundwater pressure. 
4.  Accurately determine the elapsed time for internal pressure to drop 1.0 psig. 
b.  The air test is acceptable if elapsed time for an internal pressure drop of 1.0 psig is no less than shown in the following tables: 
1.  For concrete sewer lines: 
Pipe Diameter 
(in inches) Seconds Per 
100 Feet of Pipe 18 144 21 180 24 and larger 216  
Air leakage time is based on the pipe being damp. If pipe and joints are dry, dampen the line if helpful in meeting air test time requirement.

(2)  For nominal 27-inch and larger pipe: 
a.  After completing backfill of a sewer line section, contractors shall conduct a low pressure air test on each pipe joint in the section in accordance with ASTM C 1103 for concrete pipe sewer lines or by using methods and devices acceptable to the city. Perform such tests using the following general procedures: 
1.  Properly position and completely secure the test unit over the pipe joint being tested. 
2.  Introduce low-pressure air into the pipe joint test area until the internal air pressure reaches 3.5 psig above groundwater pressure, if any. 
3.  The joint air test is acceptable if the internal pressure drops less than 2.0 psi in ten seconds. 
b.  At each manhole constructed where groundwater is known to exist, contractors shall install a small diameter pipe nipple through the manhole wall at the time that the sewer pipe is installed. Locate the nipple immediately above the lowest connecting sewer pipe, and grout the nipple in place concurrently with grouting the sewer pipe. Prior to placing the nipple, wrap it with a continuous length of heavy nylon chord, which can be pulled out, thus permitting removal of the nipple after test work is complete. Just before commencing the air test, attach a clear plastic tube to the nipple, and hold the tube end vertically upward. After the groundwater has stopped rising in the plastic tube, measure the vertical distance from water level to pipe invert in feet. Average this distance observed at manholes on each end of the test segment, and divide the average distance in feet by 2.3 to obtain the groundwater pressure to be used in computing required test air pressure. 
c.  Contractors shall permanently correct excessive leakage determined by air testing, and repeat operations until the city witnesses a successful test on each line segment or joint; then remove the nipple through the manhole wall without disturbing adjacent grout. Permanently caulk the resulting hole watertight. 
(f)  Deflection testing. 
(1)  Contractors shall conduct internal deflection testing on all installed gravity sewer lines six-inch size and larger, no sooner than 15 days after completion of trench backfilling. Repair or replace all defective pipe found during mandrel testing and conduct another deflection test to determine the extent and necessary repair of any additional deficiencies. After repairing all defects, perform successful mandrel testing in the presence of the owner or the city. Mandrel testing is successful when the mandrel device can be pulled through the pipe between manholes in a continuous operation, without interruption. 
(2)  Contractors shall furnish mandrel test gauges sized and constructed as tabulated below:

(3)  Upon request by the city, contractors shall certify the accuracy of the mandrel test gauges by sliding proving rings to an accuracy of 0.05 inches over the mandrel. Use proving rings complying with ASTM F 679 and ASTM D 3034. 
(g)  Internal television inspection. Contractors shall conduct an internal television inspection on all installed gravity sewer lines eight-inch size and larger, after trench backfilling to within one foot of finished grade. Contractors shall repair or replace all visible defects found and conduct another internal television inspection to determine the extent and necessary repair of any additional deficiencies. Contractors shall repeat the inspection and correction process until the entire work shall be free from any visible defects.

Sec. 71-849. - Trenching. 
(a)  Generally. Trenching consists of removal and disposal of material encountered to obtain required subgrade elevations, usually, but not necessarily limited to, that incidental to installation or modification of underground pipelines and appurtenances. 
(b)  Rock excavation. Rock excavation consists of removal and disposal of natural material encountered that cannot be excavated without continuous and systematic drilling and blasting or continuous use of a ripper or other special equipment. Intermittent drilling or blasting performed to increase production and unnecessary for excavation of material encountered will not be classified as rock excavation. 
(c)  Stability of excavation. Contractors shall ensure the stability of excavation by doing the following: 
(1)  Slope sides of excavations to comply with subpart P of part 1926 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended. Should any provision of a governing local code be more stringent than the preceding national standard, follow the local code. Shore and brace or use the trench box where sloping is not possible either because of space restrictions or stability of material excavated. 
(2)  Maintain sides and slopes of excavations in a safe condition until completion of backfilling. 
(d)  Shoring and bracing. Contractors shall provide shoring and bracing by doing the following: 
(1)  Provide portable trench boxes and materials for shoring and bracing, such as sheet piling, uprights, stringers and cross braces, in good serviceable condition.

(4)  Maintain a horizontal separation of at least ten feet between sanitary sewers and any existing or proposed water main. A sewer may be laid closer than ten feet to a water main if it is laid in a separate trench or it is laid in the same trench with the water main located at one side on a bench of undisturbed earth. 
(5)  Maintain a vertical separation of at least 18 inches between the crown of sanitary sewers and the invert of existing or proposed water mains with the sewer located below the water main. Where a vertical separation of 18 inches cannot be provided and the water main cannot be relocated to provide adequate clearance, center one full length of water main over the sewer so that both joints of the water main will be as far from the sewer as possible. 
(6)  Confine trench width from an elevation of one foot above the top of underground pipe to the trench bottom, to that minimum which is necessary to pipe laying operations, but do not exceed maximum trench width determined by pipe foundation requirements. 
(7)  Remove rock, masonry and concrete material to a distance of at least six inches from all parts of pipe and appurtenances being installed. Backfill and thoroughly compact, to proper trench bottom elevation, with select excavated material. 
(8)  Not mix excavated rock, masonry or concrete with backfill material placed within two feet of installed pipe, or within one foot of finished grade. 
(h)  Pavement removal. For pavement removal, contractors shall:

ARTICLE XI. - LOCAL STORMWATER DESIGN 
DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 71-989. - Purpose and intent. 
    The local stormwater design manual set forth in this article is meant to serve as a comprehensive guide to designing and implementing stormwater management controls and systems in the city. Additionally, the manual is designed to supplement the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual (GSMM), latest edition, which shall serve as the technical manual for design and specification of individual components within the system.

DIVISION 2. - GENERAL LEVEL OF SERVICE STANDARDS 

Sec. 71-1001. - Detention requirements. 
(a)  Discharge rates-From new development projects. 
(1)  Development plans including site grading and drainage plans should be developed to minimize disruption of natural drainage patterns on properties. Additionally, no increases in stormwater runoff rates shall be allowed at any discharge point on the site. The baseline (predeveloped) conditions shall be a wooded undisturbed site regardless of whether any clearing has occurred in the past and shall model any depression storage and/or detention storage. The development shall be analyzed for the following storm events: 
a.  Two-year 24-hour design storm. 
b.  Five-year 24-hour design storm. 
c.  Ten-year 24-hour design storm. 
d.  Twenty-five-year 24-hour design storm. 
e.  Fifty-year 24-hour design storm. 
f.  One hundred-year 24-hour design storm. 
(2)  If the total area of the site (i.e., total property area) and the drainage area to each stormwater management facility is less than one acre, then a rainfall intensity based analysis (i.e., rational method) may be performed. If detention facilities are to be designed and constructed in series, the 24-hour storm criteria will apply regardless of the drainage area. 
(b)  Same-From redevelopment projects. 
(1)  Development plans including site grading and drainage plans should be developed to minimize disruption of natural drainage patterns on properties. Additionally, no increases in stormwater runoff rates shall be allowed at any discharge point on the site. The baseline conditions shall be based on an analysis of the stormwater discharge rates from the site in its existing condition and shall model any depression storage and/or detention storage. The development shall be analyzed for the following storm events: 
a.  Two-year 24-hour design storm. 
b.  Five-year 24-hour design storm. 
c.  Ten-year 24-hour design storm. 
d.  Twenty-five-year 24-hour design storm. 
e.  Fifty-year 24-hour design storm. 
f.  One hundred-year 24-hour design storm. 
(2)  If the total area of the site (i.e., total property area) and the drainage area to each stormwater management facility is less than one acre, then a rainfall intensity based analysis (i.e., rational method) may be performed. If detention facilities are to be designed and constructed in series, the 24-hour storm criteria will apply regardless of the drainage area.

Sec. 71-1002. - Conveyance systems. 
(a)  Bridges. All bridges shall be designed to accommodate the 100-year 24-hour design storm with no over topping. 
(b)  Culverts and pipe systems. 
Roadway 
Classification/Use Design Storm Arterial/emergency 
evacuation roadway 100-year Collector roads 50-year Local streets 25-year Roads with no other outlet 100-year Parking lots/material storage 
areas/landscape areas 10-year  
Culverts with contributing drainage areas greater than ten acres shall be designed to the 24-hour storm. For example, if a cross drain is to be designed to convey stormwater runoff from a 20-acre drainage basin under a neighborhood road, then the design storm shall be a 25-year 24-hour storm. If a culvert is designed to connect to an existing system of a differing design level of service, then the system with the greater design requirement will be used to size the proposed system. 
(c)  Inlets (catchbasins, yard inlets, drop inlets, hooded grate inlets and flumes). Inlets collecting stormwater runoff from street surfaces and area inlets shall be sized to capture the storm event specified for the pipe system to which it drains and a maximum flooding depth as determined by the following table: 
Roadway 
Classification/Use Flooding 
Depth Arterial/emergency 
evacuation roadway One lane width open Collector roads One lane width open Local streets 8.0 ft lane width open Roads with no other outlet One lane width open Parking lots Maximum 0.5 ft depth Detention areas utilized for other purposes (i.e., parking lot detention, etc.) with flood warning sign Maximum 1.5 ft depth Material storage areas/landscape areas Maximum 2.0 ft depth  
Inlets and grading adjacent to habitable structures shall be designed to prevent stormwater runoff from entering the structure during the 100-year design storm. 
(d)  Inlets (headwalls, flared end sections, etc.). Inlets that utilize the opening of the pipe as the inlet (i.e., headwalls, flared end sections, etc.) shall be sized to capture the storm event specified for the pipe system to which it drains and a maximum flooding depth that will not result in bypass of the inlet or cause structural/nuisance flooding. 
(e)  Roadside ditches. Roads constructed without curb and gutter shall incorporate ditches that are designed to the specific design storms as shown in the following table: 
Roadway 
Classification/Use Design Storm Arterial/emergency evacuation roadway 100-year Collector roads 50-year Local streets 25-year Roads with no other outlet 100-year  
(f)  Drainage channels. For drainage channels designed to convey stormwater runoff either from or to a culvert, the channel should be sized to accommodate the same storm event specified for the pipe system. Channels designed to convey stormwater runoff to detention ponds shall be sized to accommodate the 100-year design storm.

(b)  Findings. Trees are a valuable asset to the rural/urban environment of the city and generate such benefits as: 
(1)  The purification of air; 
(2)  The moderation of the micro-climate; 
(3)  The reduction of noise and glare; 
(4)  The conservation of energy in terms of heating and cooling; 
(5)  The prevention of soil erosion; 
(6)  Reduced costs in terms of stormwater management; 
(7)  The minimization of flood potential; 
(8)  Improved water quality; 
(9)  The enhancement and stabilization of property values; 
(10)  Increased aesthetics; and 
(11)  The preservation of rural character.

(8)  Any applicant for a tree removal permit who is aggrieved by any decision of the city administrator or his designee relating to the application of this chapter shall have the right to appeal said decision as provided under chapter 80, article VIII, pertaining to the board of zoning appeals. 
(9)  Any revisions to the proposed development of a property, and any changes reflected in a subsequently submitted tree removal permit application, shall be shown on a revised tree protection plan and landscape plan and be considered as a part of the new or revised tree removal permit prior to the commencement of such changed activities. 
(Code 1966, § 24A-8; Ord. No. 92-06, § 1, 8-10-1992; Ord. No. 2012-15, § 1, 12-10-2012) 
Sec. 74-33. - Waiver in emergency situations. 
    In case of emergencies such as windstorms, ice storms, or other disasters, the requirements of section 74-31 may be waived by the city administrator or his designee during the emergency period so that the requirements of this chapter would in no way hamper private or public work to restore order to the city. 
(Code 1966, § 24A-9; Ord. No. 92-06, § 1, 8-10-1992; Ord. No. 2012-15, § 1, 12-10-2012) 
Sec. 74-34. - Tree density-Minimum standards. 
    On each property for which a tree protection plan, landscape plan and permit is required by this chapter, existing trees may be retained and new trees shall be planted such that the property shall attain or exceed the greater of: 
(1)  A tree density standard of 20 units per acre; or 
(2)  One unit per 2,000 sq. ft. of proposed imperious area. 
Any acreage within a zoning buffer area and any trees needed to meet buffer requirements as set forth in chapter 80 or conditions of zoning approval shall be excluded from site acreage and density calculations. Tree removal shall not be permitted in floodplain and floodplain area shall be excluded from site acreage and density calculations. The trees, both existing and new, where feasible, shall be reasonably distributed throughout the site, with emphasis on tree groupings to achieve aesthetic results following professional landscaping standards. Trees may be retained or planted for credit within a public right-of-way if granted approval by the city administrator or his designee. All commercial, industrial, office and multi-family residential projects shall also provide seven shrubs per required density unit. 
(Code 1966, § 24A-10(a); Ord. No. 92-06, § 1, 8-10-1992; Ord. No. 2012-15, § 1, 12-10-2012; Ord. No. 2015-02, § 1, 2-23-2015) 
Sec. 74-35. - Same-Standard calculation. 
    The tree density standard shall be calculated by adding the following credits and dividing by the total acreage or square footage of impervious area of the project included within the limits of the permit application (but excluding any acreage included within a zoning buffer and/or floodplain): 
(1)  Credit for existing trees to be retained shall be calculated by multiplying the number of trees (by diameter) times the units assigned in the following Table 74-A. Credit shall be given all trees retained on a property having a diameter of three inches or more, except trees located in a zoning buffer and/or floodplain. Zoning buffers and floodplain area shall not be calculated in density acreage nor shall existing trees in these areas be utilized to fulfill density requirements. 
(2)  Credit for new trees proposed on the site shall be calculated by multiplying the number of trees (by diameter) times the units assigned in the following Table 74-B. Credit shall be given all new trees on a property except for new trees of less than one-inch caliper and new trees planted in a required zoning buffer. Seedling trees of less than one-inch caliper may only be used for timber reforestation of areas greater than one-half acre. 
(3)  Additional credits shall be granted under the following circumstances: 
a.  A total tree density credit not to exceed twice the units shown on Table 74-A, may be granted by the city administrator or his designee for existing trees to be retained which have greater value as outstanding specimen trees or having historic value or being a rare or unique species. 
b.  Existing trees to be retained within a minimum yard area (as required by the applicable zoning district) may be granted a bonus credit up to 50 percent of the units assigned in Table 74-A unless the tree is located within a required zoning buffer.

Sec. 74-36. - Tree protection requirements. 
    The following guidelines and standards shall apply to trees proposed to be retained for credit toward meeting the minimum required tree density standard on a property: 
(1)  Tree protection areas. The root system within the dripline is generally considered to be the critical root zone. To protect these critical root zones, a tree protection area shall be established around each tree or group of trees to be retained. 
a.  The tree protection area shall include no less than the total area beneath the tree canopy as defined by the dripline of the tree or group of trees collectively. In some instances, a larger area than the dripline area may be required to be designated as a tree protection area as determined by the state forestry commission or the city engineer. 
b.  Layout of the project site utility and grading plans shall avoid disturbance of the tree protection areas. 
c.  Construction site activities such as parking, materials storage, concrete washout, burnhole placement, etc., shall be arranged so as to prevent disturbances within tree protection areas. 
(2)  Protective barriers. 
a.  Protective tree fencing shall be installed between tree protection areas and areas proposed to be cleared, graded or otherwise disturbed on the site, prior to any land disturbance. 
b.  All tree protection areas shall be designated as such with "tree protection area" signs posted in addition to the required protective fencing. Signs requiring subcontractor cooperation and compliance with tree protection standards shall be placed at site entrances. 
c.  All tree protection areas must be protected from soil sedimentation intrusion through the use of silt fence or other acceptable measures placed upslope from the tree protection area. 
d.  All protective tree fencing and all erosion control barriers must be installed prior to and maintained throughout the land disturbance and construction process, and shall not be removed until final landscaping is installed or final plat approval. 
(3)  Encroachment . If encroachment into a tree protection area occurs which causes irreparable damage to the trees, the tree protection plan and landscape plan shall be revised to compensate for the loss. Under no circumstances shall the developer be relieved of responsibility for compliance with the provisions of this chapter, nor shall plan revision activities stop the city administrator or his designee from instituting action for violation of this chapter. 
(4)  Fill dirt. It is prohibited to place fill dirt in any tree protection areas or around any replacement trees. 
(5)  Biodegradable debris. All biodegradable debris, including but not limited to stumps, limbs or tops of trees, shall be properly disposed of and shall not be buried on site. 
(Code 1966, § 24A-11; Ord. No. 92-06, § 1, 8-10-1992; Ord. No. 2012-15, § 1, 12-10-2012) 
Sec. 74-37. - Tree protection-Prior to development. 
    To prevent the unnecessary destruction of trees on land where a land disturbance permit or tree removal permit has not been issued, the destruction or removal of the trees on any one parcel of real property within the city, without prior approval of the city administrator or his designee, is prohibited. 
(Code 1966, § 24A-12; Ord. No. 92-06, § 1, 8-10-1992; Ord. No. 2012-15, § 1, 12-10-2012) 
Sec. 74-38. - Same-During development. 
    The following are the requirements and guidelines for tree protection to be followed during the grading and construction process: 
(1)  All individual stand-alone trees to be retained on the site must be marked with orange engineering tape tied around the trunk of the tree at a height of five feet above the ground. 
(2)  The tree protection area (dripline area) of stand-alone trees and stands of trees will be marked with standard tree protection fencing (orange). At least two "tree protection area" signs shall be posted at each individual tree protection area. No construction activities will be allowed within the tree protection area. 
(3)  The tree protection area shall be maintained as a natural vegetation area or an area landscaped with shrubs or understory trees when possible and mulched with either pine straw or shredded wood fiber. The seeding or sodding of grass in the tree protection area is to be avoided. 
(4)  Credit for existing trees shall not be granted if there is any proposed or actual encroachment into dripline of the tree(s). If existing trees are to be saved, special attention shall be given to the protection of the dripline area (roots) and pruning of the tree may be required to reduce potential damage from stress. In situations such as this, the state forestry commission should be contacted for technical assistance. 
(5)  Utilities shall not be run through a tree protection area unless they are tunneled at a depth of 24 inches in a manner which will damage as little of the root system as possible. 
(6)  If it is determined that irreparable damage has occurred to a tree or trees within a designated tree protection area, as determined by the city administrator, his designee or the state forestry commission, then it shall be the responsibility of the owner to remove and replace the tree or trees and guarantee survival. 
(Code 1966, § 24A-13; Ord. No. 92-06, § 1, 8-10-1992; Ord. No. 2012-15, § 1, 12-10-2012) 
Sec. 74-39. - Tree replacement after development. 
    In some cases, tree replacement (recompense planting) will be necessary to fulfill the tree density requirement. Although the preservation of existing trees is important, it is also important to replenish the rural/urban forest as development occurs with new trees to ensure the presence of trees for generations to come. The following are the requirements for tree replacement at the conclusion of the construction process: 
(1)  All planting shall be as designated on the approved landscape plan. 
a.  New trees proposed to be planted for credit toward meeting the minimum required tree density standard in a property shall comply with the following guidelines and standards: 
1.  The spacing of new trees must be compatible with spatial site limitations and with responsible consideration towards species size when mature. 
2.  Trees selected for replacement must be quality specimens free of disease, injury or infestation and must be ecologically compatible with the specifically intended growing area and provided in accordance with standards established in the American Standard for Nursery Stock (ANSI 260.1-2004). 
(2)  A 50 percent mix of replacement canopy and replacement understory trees shall be maintained. Canopy trees shall be a minimum 21/2" caliper. Understory trees shall be a minimum 11/2" caliper. 
(3)  Replacement trees shall not be planted within 15 feet of any structure or within five feet of a paved driveway unless they are replacement understory trees. 
(4)  In the event that new trees proposed to be planted to achieve the tree density standard are not installed upon application for a certificate of occupancy or final plat approval (as appropriate), then a performance bond or other acceptable surety in an amount equal to 300 percent (unit cost plus unit installed plus unit guaranteed) of the cost of the new trees shall be posted in accordance with performance bonding requirements. 
(5)  Upon final installation of landscaping planted under the requirements of this chapter, and following acceptance by the city administrator or his designee, the owner shall warrant the landscaping and provide for the replacement of that which does not survive. 
(Code 1966, § 24A-14; Ord. No. 92-06, § 1, 8-10-1992; Ord. No. 2012-15, § 1, 12-10-2012) 
Sec. 74-40. - Tree bank. 
    When tree removal is permitted or required by this article and the minimum tree density standard cannot be met due to unforeseen conditions, the owner shall not be relieved of the requirements of this chapter. The city administrator may allow the owner to provide required tree density in the following manner: 
(1)  Planting replacement trees on city property, provided that city has an identified need; 
(2)  Provide monetary compensation to the city which it may use at its discretion for the purchase of plant material, canopy preservation and/or environmental education. The monetary contribution to the city shall be 100 percent (unit cost plus unit installed plus unit guaranteed) of the cost of the new trees. 
(Code 1966, § 24A-15; Ord. No. 92-06, § 1, 8-10-1992; Ord. No. 2012-15, § 1, 12-10-2012; Ord. No. 2015-01, 2-23-2015)

Sec. 77-76. - Concept plat review process. 
    The steps of the concept plat review process are as follows: 
(1)  Step 1. The developer of a proposed subdivision shall meet with the development coordinator to discuss what is required for concept plat approval in terms of documents, fees, and schedules. 
(2)  Step 2. The developer shall submit to the city a complete concept plat application package, and that submittal shall be logged in by the administrative assistant. 
(3)  Step 3. The concept plat application package is carefully checked by the development coordinator to determine whether or not it is complete. If it is incomplete, it needs to be returned to the developer with an explanation of why it is incomplete and what must be done to make it complete. The developer will then begin the process again with step 2 set forth in subsection (2) and no additional fee will be required. 
(4)  Step 4. If the concept plat application package is complete, it will be accepted by the development coordinator; the date of acceptance will be noted; and the concept plat will be distributed for staff comments. For every submittal, copies shall be provided to the director of community development, the city engineer, the property manager, the fire marshal and the city's engineering consultant. Copies will also be provided to other staff members on an as-needed basis. The staff shall have at least ten working days for review of the concept plat, preparing comments and submitting a report to the development coordinator. 
(5)  Step 5. After the staff review period, the development coordinator shall schedule a staff review meeting. At least five working days prior to that meeting, all staff members shall be provided a copy of all staff reports. 
(6)  Step 6. At the staff review meeting, all reports shall be reviewed and all differences resolved. All notes, memos and documents concerning that meeting shall be kept in the project file. 
(7)  Step 7. The results of the staff meeting shall be combined into a single staff report by the development coordinator. That report shall be reviewed and approved by all participating staff members prior to it being released to the developer. 
(8)  Step 8. If the staff report concludes the concept plat can be placed on a planning and zoning commission agenda, it should be scheduled for the next available regular meeting. If the report concludes the concept plat is not acceptable, the concept plat shall be returned to the developer with an explanation of why it was found to not be acceptable, and with instructions as to what needs to be done to make it acceptable. The developer will then begin the process again at step 2 set forth in subsection (2) and a new plat review fee will be required. 
(9)  Step 9. The development coordinator shall forward the approved staff report and the concept plat application package to the planning and zoning commission members at least five calendar days prior to the scheduled meeting of the commission. If the report cannot be provided to the members at least five calendar days prior to the meeting, the matter must be rescheduled to a subsequent regular meeting. 
(10)  Step 10. The planning and zoning commission shall review the concept plat and the staff report at the scheduled regular meeting. If the commission approves the concept plat, the developer will be authorized to proceed with the preparation of a preliminary plat that will be based on the approved concept and be in accordance with all conditions and agreements included in the commission's action to approve the concept. If approval of the concept plat is denied or tabled by the commission, the developer shall be provided with the reasons for denial or tabling and an explanation of what will be required to secure approval. In this event, the developer will begin the process again with step 2 set forth in subsection (2) and a new plat review fee will be required.

(8)  Step 8. If the staff report concludes the site development plans can be approved, the city engineer shall approve two identical sets of plans, one for the developer and one for the city. The developer shall then make ten copies of the approved set for the city, along with one 11-inch by 17-inch set. The developer shall keep one copy of the approved set on the construction site at all times. 
(9)  Step 9. Upon request, after approval on the site development plans, the city engineer shall issue a permit to install the erosion control facilities and the tree-save fence in accordance with the approved plans. A fee is required for this permit. 
(10)  Step 10. Upon request, the staff shall inspect the property to determine whether or not the erosion control facilities and tree-save fence were installed properly. This inspection shall take place within three working days of the request. If the installation is approved, the developer may next request a permit to clear the unprotected trees and grade the land. 
(11)  Step 11. If the installation is not approved, the developer shall be informed in writing of what needs to be done to secure approval, and then begin the process again with step 10 set forth in subsection (a)(10). A reinspection fee shall be required. 
(12)  Step 12. After approval of the erosion control facilities and tree-save fence, the developer may request that the city engineer issue a permit to clear and grade the property in accordance with the approved plans. A fee is required for this permit. 
(13)  Step 13. Upon request, the staff shall inspect the property to determine whether or not the clearing and grading were done properly. This inspection shall take place within five working days of the request. If the clearing and grading are approved, the developer may next request a final site development permit. 
(14)  Step 14. If the clearing and grading are not approved, the developer shall be informed in writing of what needs to be done to secure approval, and then begin the process again with step 13 set forth in subsection (a)(13). A reinspection fee shall be required.

(16)  Step 16. Upon request, the staff shall inspect the property to determine whether or not the site has been developed in accordance with the approved plans. Also, the developer shall submit for review and approval all test results and certifications that are required to demonstrate satisfactory construction and adherence to all codes, ordinances and development standards. On the basis of the site inspection and the review of the supporting documentation, the staff shall determine whether or not the construction work is acceptable. This determination shall be made within ten working days of the request. If it is determined that the construction is satisfactory, the city engineer will authorize the preparation of a final plat. 
(17)  Step 17. If the construction is not approved, the developer shall be informed in writing of what needs to be done to secure approval, and then begin the process again with step 16 set forth in subsection (a)(16). A reinspection fee shall be required. 
(b)  Approval of changes to plan. If the developer wishes to make any substantive change to the construction plans at any time during the process, that change must first be approved by the planning and zoning commission in accordance with the preliminary plat review process. 
(c)  Staff inspections and progress reports. Staff inspections will be performed on a regular basis during the construction process to assure conformance with the approved plans and specifications; and regular progress reports will be presented to the planning and zoning commission and the mayor and council.

Sec. 77-159. - Review process. 
    The steps of the final plat review process are as follows: 
(1)  Step 1. The developer shall meet with the development coordinator to discuss what is required for final plat approval in terms of documents, fees and schedules. 
(2)  Step 2. The developer shall submit to the city a complete final plat application package, and that submittal shall be logged in by the administrative assistant. That package must include a landscape plan prepared by a professional landscape architect for all public areas within the subdivision. 
(3)  Step 3. The final plat application package is carefully checked by the development coordinator to determine whether or not it is complete. If it is incomplete, it needs to be returned to the developer with an explanation of why it is incomplete and what must be done to make it complete. The developer will then begin the process again with step 2 set forth in subsection (2) and no additional fee will be required. 
(4)  Step 4. If the final plat application package is complete, it will be accepted by the development coordinator; the date of acceptance will be noted; and the final plat will be distributed for staff comments. For every submittal, copies shall be provided to the director of community development, the city engineer, the property manager, the fire marshal and the city's engineering consultant. Copies will also be provided to other staff members on an as-needed basis. The staff shall have at least ten working days for review of the final plat, preparing comments and submitting a report to the development coordinator. 
(5)  Step 5. After the staff review period, the development coordinator shall schedule a staff review meeting. At least five working days prior to that meeting, all staff members shall be provided a copy of all staff reports. 
(6)  Step 6. At the staff review meeting, all reports shall be reviewed and all differences resolved. All notes, memos and documents concerning that meeting shall be kept in the project file. 
(7)  Step 7. The results of the staff meeting shall be combined into a single staff report by the development coordinator. That report shall be reviewed and approved by all participating staff members prior to it being released to the developer. 
(8)  Step 8. If the staff report concludes the final plat can be placed on a planning and zoning commission agenda, it should be scheduled for the next available regular meeting. If the report concludes the final plat is not acceptable, the final plat shall be returned to the developer with an explanation of why it was found to not be acceptable, and with instructions as to what needs to be done to make it acceptable. The developer will then begin the process again at step 2 set forth in subsection (2) and a new plat review fee will be required. 
(9)  Step 9. The development coordinator shall forward the approved staff report and the final plat application package to the planning and zoning commission members at least five calendar days prior to the scheduled meeting of the commission. If the report cannot be provided to the members at least five calendar days prior to the meeting, the matter must be rescheduled to a subsequent regular meeting. 
(10)  Step 10. The planning and zoning commission shall review the final plat and the staff report at the scheduled regular meeting. If the commission approves the final plat, it shall be forwarded to the mayor and council with a recommendation for approval, along with any supplemental conditions or comments. If the commission is not able to approve the final plat, it shall table the matter and provide the developer with instructions as to what needs to be done to secure approval. The developer will then begin the process again with step 2 set forth in subsection (2) and a new plat review fee will be required. 
(11)  Step 11. The development coordinator shall prepare a staff report for the mayor and council to accompany the package to be forwarded by the planning and zoning commission. The staff report must be reviewed and approved by all staff members involved in the initial staff report and the chairman of the planning and zoning commission. If necessary, a meeting will be held to resolve any differences before the report is submitted to the mayor and council. 
(12)  Step 12. Following approval of the staff report, it shall be distributed to the mayor and council at least five calendar days prior to a scheduled council meeting. If the report and the final plat application package cannot be distributed at least five calendar days prior to the meeting, the matter will need to be rescheduled to a subsequent regular council meeting. 
(13)  Step 13. If the developer makes any substantive change to the final plat between the time it is approved by the planning and zoning commission and it is scheduled to be reviewed by the mayor and council, the developer will need to begin the process again with step 2 set forth in subsection (2) and a new plat review fee will be required. 
(14)  Step 14. The mayor and council shall review the final plat, the staff report, and all related documents and reports at a scheduled regular meeting. If the final plat is approved, the developer will be authorized to proceed with recording the final plat. If approval of the final plat is denied for some reason, the developer shall be provided with the reason for denial and an explanation of what would need to be done to secure approval. In this event, the developer may be required to begin the process again with step 2 set forth in subsection (2) and a new plat review fee will be required. If the mayor and council table the review of the final plat for additional information, the developer shall provide that information to the development coordinator as soon as possible and the developer shall begin the process again with step 11 set forth in subsection (11), but no additional fee shall be required. 
(15)  Step 15. Prior to recording the final plat, the developer shall provide to the development coordinator a complete and accurate set of as-built drawings in both paper and electronic form. These as-built drawings must be approved by the city engineer and the city's engineering consultant. 
(16)  Step 16. Prior to recording the final plat, the developer shall complete all required improvements, including the installation of the landscape plan and recompense plantings for the public areas, and those improvements must all be inspected and approved by the city. If for any reason, it is not possible or practical for the developer to be able to complete this work within a reasonable period of time, the developer may post a cash bond, the amount of which shall be determined by the city engineer, pending the satisfactory completion of the work. 
(17)  Step 17. Prior to recording the final plat, the developer must post with the city an acceptable maintenance bond to guarantee the quality and workmanship of the required improvements as specified in section 77-158(1).

(b)  Findings and intent. 
(1)  Georgia Highway 74, which serves as the southern gateway to the city is expected to continue experiencing rapid growth in residential, commercial, and industrial construction. Development of well over 1,000 acres of raw land is being driven by proximity to Atlanta and Hartsfield International Airport, as well as access to the interstate system. 
(2)  The regulations set forth in this section are intended to insure attractive developments which are complimentary and will promote a mix of uses rather than the undesirable commercial sprawl which has plagued many communities and threatened the very character that attracted such development interests. These standards will reinforce and implement a land use plan that features residential, office, personal services, hospitality uses, and retail commercial uses along Georgia Highway 74. 
(3)  To this end, it is the city's goal to protect the aesthetics of the community, provide for safe travel through, and access to the area and safeguard the welfare of its residents, while encouraging development along the Georgia Highway 74 corridor. 
(c)  Boundary. This district is intended as an overlay district regulating and allowing the establishment of uses within the configuration of the allowable Georgia Highway 74 overlay district boundaries. Said boundary shall include any properties or portions thereof, located within 500 feet of the Georgia Highway 74 right-of-way, as it presently exists or may exist in the future. The underlying district shall continue as permitted uses. Standards set out in this section for site development and architectural design shall control over any underlying district regulations.

    DRASTIC means the standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency document EPA-600/2-87-035. The DRASTIC methodology is the most widely used technique for evaluating pollution susceptibility. 
    Hazardous waste means any solid waste, by reason of its toxic, caustic, corrosive, abrasive, or otherwise injurious properties, may be detrimental to the health of any person handling or otherwise coming into contract with such material or substance. The U.S Environmental Protection Agency has developed a list of hazardous wastes based upon corrosivity, reactivity, and toxicity. 
    Impervious surface means a manmade structure or surface that prevents the infiltration of stormwater into the ground below the structure of surface. Examples are buildings, roads driveways, parking altos, decks, swimming pools, or patios. 
    Perennial stream means a stream that flows throughout the whole year as indicated on a USGS quad map. 
    Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area. 
    Pollution susceptibility maps means maps of relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the department of natural resources using the DRASTIC methodology pollution susceptibility maps categorize the land areas of the state into areas having high, medium, and low groundwater pollution potential. 
    Recharge area means any portion of the earth's surface, where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer. 
    Regulated activity means any activity which will, or which may reasonably be expected to result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, excepting those activities exempted in section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
    River/stream bank means the rising ground, bordering a river or a stream, which serves to confine the water to the natural channel during the normal course of flow. 
    Significant recharge area means those areas mapped by the department of natural resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18, 1998 edition. Mapping of recharge areas is based on outcrop area, litho logy, sol type, thickness, slope density of litho logy contracts geologic structure, presence of karts, and potentionmetric surfaces. Significant recharge areas are as follows in the various geologic provinces of the state: 
(1)  In the Piedmont and in the Blue Ridge, rocks have little primary porosity, with most groundwater being stored in the overlying soils. 
(2)  The significant recharge are those with thicker soils. 
(3)  Field mapping indicates thick soils in the Piedmont and Blue Ridge are characterized by a density of tow ore more geologic contracts per four square miles (source: 1976 1.500,000 Geologic Map of Georgia) and slopes lower than eight percent. 
    Small water supply watershed means a watershed that contains less than 100 square miles of land within the drainage basin upstream of a governmentally owned public drinking water supply intake. 
    Utility means public or private water or sewer piping systems, water or sewer pumping stations, electric power lines, fuel pipelines, telephone lines, roads, driveways, bridges, river/lake access facilities, stormwater systems and railroads or other utilities identified by a local government.

(c)  Types of water resource districts. 
(1)  The water resource districts shall include the following: 
a.  Groundwater recharge area district; 
b.  Wetlands district; and 
c.  Water supply watershed district. 
(2)  The boundaries of these water resource districts are shown on a set of maps designated as "Overlay District" and are included as part of the official zoning map, which is on file with the city clerk's office. 
(d)  Groundwater recharge area district. 
(1)  Description. Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides, herbicides spayed on crops, animal waste, and septic tank effluents contribute to a deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair the their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies. 
(2)  Purpose. The purpose of the groundwater recharge area district is to establish criteria to protect significant groundwater recharge areas from pollution by spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, application of chemicals, injections and other development pressures. 
(3)  District limits. The groundwater recharge area protection map is delineated according to the state department of natural resources' Significant Recharge Areas, Hydrological Atlas 18, 1989 edition, and the state department of natural resources' Pollution Susceptibility Map, Hydrological Atlas 20, 1992 edition. Standards for this district shall comply with the DNR rule 391-3-16-.02, Criteria for the Protection of Groundwater Recharge Areas. 
(e)  Criteria in significant recharge areas. 
(1)  Secondary containment for storage tanks. New aboveground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of 660 gallons, shall have secondary containment for 110 percent of the volume of such tanks or 110 percent of the volume of the larges tank in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt, provided they comply with all federal requirements. 
(2)  New agricultural waste impoundment sites. 
a.  All new agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they are within: 
1.  A high pollution susceptibility area. 
2.  A medium pollution susceptibility area and exceed 15-acre feet; 
3.  A low pollution susceptibility area and exceed 50 feet. 
b.  Construction standards. As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compacted clay having a thickness of one-foot and vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 by 10 7 cm/sec or other criteria established by the Natural Resources Conservation Service. The average size of existing agricultural waste impoundments in the state is about 15 acre feet; sheep-foot rollers or pans with heavy rubber tires, which are normal equipment for most state moving contractors, should be able to compact clay to the recommended vertical hydraulic conductivity. 
(3)  Minimum lot sizes for new homes served by septic tank/drain field systems. New homes served by septic tank/drain fields systems shall be on lots having the minimum size limitations as follows, based on application of table MT-1 of the DHR manual (hereinafter DHR table MT-1). The minimums set forth in table MT-1 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in sections A-F) of the DHR manual. 
a.  One hundred fifty percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR table MT-1 if they are within a high pollution susceptibly area; 
b.  One hundred twenty-five percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR table MT-1 if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area; and

(f)  Wetland districts. 
(1)  Description. The wetlands within the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion, and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control, flood control; natural resource education; scientific study, and recreational opportunities. 
(2)  Purpose. The purpose of this district is to promote the wise use of wetlands and protect them from alterations witch will significantly affect or reduce the primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic natural area, and wildlife habitat areas. 
(3)  District limits. these regulations shall apply to all lands within wetlands located within the city. The Wetland District Overlay Map, adopted as part of this chapter by reference, shows the general location of wetlands, according to the 1987 National Wetlands Inventory, and should be consulted by persons considering activities in or near wetlands before engaging in a regulated activity. The standards for this district shall comply with department of natural resources rule 391-3-16-.03, Criteria for Wetlands Protection." 
a.  The Wetlands District Overlay Map does not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands within the city and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. 
b.  No local government action under the local ordinance relives the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
(4)  Development permit required. No regulated activity will be permitted within the wetlands protection district without written permission or a permit form the city. If the project is of a type that may result in a disturbance of wetlands and is located within 50 feet of a wetlands protection district boundary, as determined by the city using the generalized wetlands map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determine that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the locate permit or permission will not be granted until a section 404 permit or letter of permission is issued. 
(5)  Permitted uses. The following uses are permitted by right within the wetland district to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill draining or dredging: 
a.  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the state forestry commission. Section 404 does not require permits for normal, ongoing silvicultrual activities. However, section 404 does list some required road construction best management practice that must be followed in order to quality for such an exemption which includes the following: 
1.  Conservation or preservation of soil, water, vegetation, fish or other wildlife, provided the conservation or preservation does not affect waters of the state or of the United Streets in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit; 
2.  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing; 
3.  Natural water quality treatment or purifications; and 
4.  Normal agriculture activities including the planting and harvesting of crops and pasturing of livestock. Such activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the state department of agriculture. 
(6)  Prohibited uses. The following uses are prohibited in a wetland district: 
a.  Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants; and 
b.  Hazardous or sanitary landfills. 
(g)  Water supply watershed district. 
(1)  Description. In order to provide for the health, safety, and welfare of the public and a healthy economic climate within the city and surrounding communities, it is essential that the quality of public drinking water be assured. The ability of natural systems to filter stormwater runoff can be threatened by unrestricted urban and suburban development. Land disturbing activities associated with development can increase erosion and sedimentation that threatens the storage capacity of reservoirs. In addition, stormwater runoff, particularly from impervious surfaces, can introduce toxicants, nutrients, and sediment into drinking water supplies, making water treatment more complicated, expensive and rendering water resources unusable. Industrial land uses that involve the manufacturer, use, transport and storage of hazardous or toxic waste materials result in the potential risk of contamination of nearby drinking water supplies. 
(2)  Purpose. The purpose of the water supply watershed protection overlay regulations is to establish measures to protect the quality and quantity of the present and future water supply for the city which will minimize the transport of pollutants and sediment to the water supply, and maintain the yield of the water supply watersheds. 
(3)  District limits. The protected water supply watershed districts are hereby designated, and shall comprise the land areas which drain to the water supply intake and the public water supply reservoirs. The boundaries of these districts are defined by the ridgelines of the respective watersheds and the boundary of a radius seven miles upstream of the respective public water supply and water supply reservoirs. These districts shall be further delineated and defined on the Water Supply Watershed District Overlay Map of the city's Official Zoning District Map, which is herby incorporated and made a part of this chapter by reference. The standards of this district shall comply with department of natural resources rule 391-3-16-.01, Criteria for the Protection of the Water Supply Watersheds and the Reservoir Management Plan adopted by the city. 
a.  Line Creek is a small water supply watershed. An intake for the City of Newnan is located on this creek and does not contain a reservoir. 
b.  White Water Creek is a small water supply watershed. An intake for the City of Newnan is located on this creek and does not contain a reservoir. 
(4)  Permitted uses. Uses which were lawful on May 9, 2000, shall be allowed to continue as lawful land uses until such time as the use is abandoned. All uses, except those uses set forth in subsection (g)(5) of this section, allowed in the underlying zoning districts as established by this section are permitted in the water supply watershed district, subject to the following standards:

(5)  Natural buffer: A portion of a parcel which shall be set aside to provide a separation between the use(s) on the parcel and adjoining parcels or uses or a stream through the use of natural vegetation, replanting, and supplemental plantings. Vegetation within a natural buffer area shall not be disturbed except for approved access and utility crossings. For lakes and/or reservoirs, the natural buffer shall be measured from the normal pool elevation. For streams and/or creeks, the natural buffer shall be measured from the stream bank. 
(6)  Natural vegetation: Undisturbed, maintenance-free, self-perpetuating stand of vegetation comprised of indigenous shrubs, flowers, wild grasses and trees. 
(7)  Nitrification field : A nitrification field shall be defined as any system for the on-site disposal of wastewater. 
(8)  Perennial stream: A stream that has normal stream flow consisting of base flow (discharge that enters the stream channel mainly from groundwater) or both base flow and direct runoff during any period of the year. 
(9)  Reservoir boundary: The edge of a water supply reservoir defined by its normal pool elevation level. 
(10)  Small water supply watershed: A watershed area which is less than 100 square miles as defined by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources Environmental Protection Division.

ARTICLE V. - NONCONFORMING LOTS, USES, AND STRUCTURES[4] 

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2012-04, § 1, adopted June 11, 2012, repealed ch. 80, art. V, §§ 80-196-80-204 and added § 80-243. Former ch. 80, art. V, pertained to nonconforming uses and was derived from Ord. No. 2008-10Z, Exh. A, §§ 7.01-7.09, adopted August 25, 2008. 

Sec. 80-243. - Nonconforming lots, uses, and structures. 
    Within the zoning districts established by this article there may exist lots, structures, and uses of both land and structures which were lawful before the ordinance from which this section is derived was adopted or subsequently amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this article as adopted or subsequently amended. It is the intent of this article to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is further the intent of this article that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, extended or expanded, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited in the same district. 
    Nonconforming lots, uses, and structures may continue in their nonconforming status with the following limitations and/or requirements: 
(1)  Nonconforming lot. A single, lawful lot-of-record which does not meet the requirements of this article for area or dimensions, or both, may be used for the buildings and accessory buildings necessary to carry out permitted uses subject to the following provisions: 
a.  Parking space requirements as provided for in article IX are met; and 
b.  Such lot does not adjoin another vacant lot(s) or portion of a lot in the same ownership. 
c.  If two or more adjoining lots or portions of lots in single ownership do not meet the requirements established for lot width, frontage or area, the property involved shall be treated as one lot, and no portion of said lot shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with this article. 
d.  In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this article is derived, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter only so long as it is used for a single-family residence. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than those applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only through the action of the planning and zoning commission. 
(2)  Nonconforming uses of land. When a use of land is nonconforming pursuant to the provisions of this article, such use may continue as long as it remains otherwise lawful and complies with the following provisions: 
a.  No nonconforming use shall be enlarged, increased or extended to occupy a greater area of land than that which was occupied at the time the use became nonconforming; 
b.  No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the lot not occupied by such use at the time the use became nonconforming; and 
c.  If any nonconforming use of land ceases for a period of six months or more, any subsequent use of such land shall comply with this article. 
(3)  Nonconforming use of structures. If a lawful use of structure, or of a structure and lot in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption of the ordinance from which this section is derived or its subsequent amendment that would not be allowed under provisions of this article as adopted or amended, to avoid undue hardship, the lawful but nonconforming use may be continued so long as it complies with other regulations, subject to the following conditions: 
a.  Such nonconforming use: 
1.  Shall not be changed to another nonconforming use. 
2.  Shall not be reestablished after its removal from the property or its discontinuance for one year or more, or unless the premises are under a continuing lease but are unoccupied by the nonconforming use, regardless of the intent of the owner or occupier to resume the nonconforming use. 
3.  Shall not be extended to occupy a greater area of land. 
4.  Shall not be extended to occupy a greater area of a building or structure unless such additional area of the building or structure existed at the time of the passage or amendment of the ordinance from which this section is derived and was clearly designed to house the same use as the nonconforming use occupying the other portion of the building or structure. 
b.  If an existing use was lawfully established in a zoning district that is subsequently amended to require a use permit approval for such use, pursuant to article IV administrative permits and use permits, the existing use shall not be subject to the provisions of this subsection. 
c.  Any intended but not yet existing nonconforming use for which a vested right was acquired prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this section is derived or the adoption of an amendment to it shall be prohibited unless such intended nonconforming use for which a vested right was acquired is actually commenced within one-year of the adoption of the ordinance from which this section is derived or the adoption of an amendment to it, regardless of the intent or expectation to commence or abandon such nonconforming use. 
(4)  Nonconforming structures. When a lawful structure exists on the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance from which this section is derived or its amendments that could not be built under the terms of this article because of restrictions on building area, lot coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics of the structure or its location on the lot, such structure may continue and remain as long as it complies with all other zoning regulations, subject to the following conditions: 
a.  No structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity; but any structure or portion may be altered to decrease its nonconformity. 
b.  Any structure which is moved, for any reason and for any distance whatever, shall conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located. 
c.  Destruction by any means of more than 50 percent of the appraised valuation of the structure shall require that the structure be reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this article. The "appraised valuation" is the value of the structure prior to such destruction or damage having occurred, and shall be the appraised value established by the county tax assessor. 
d.  Destruction by any means of 50 percent or less of the appraised valuation of the structure shall not require that the structure be reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this article. However, if a building permit to reconstruct the structure is not obtained with 12 months from its destruction, the structure shall be reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of this article. 
e.  Accessory structures. Nonconforming, accessory structures shall be subject to the same provisions as govern the primary structure to which they are an accessory. 
f.  Telecommunications facilities. 
1.  All telecommunication facilities existing on the effective date of the ordinance from which this section is derived shall be allowed to continue to be used as they presently exist. 
2.  Routine maintenance (including modifications to accommodate the co-location of an additional user or users) shall be permitted on existing telecommunication facilities. 
3.  Replacement of antennas on a structure with different antennas shall be considered routine maintenance so long as the replacement antenna(s) does not increase the height of any existing structure. 
(5)  Rezoning which results in nonconforming structures. When a property containing lawful structures is rezoned, the following shall apply: 
a.  The approval of the rezoning by the city council shall automatically adjust minimum/maximum yards to the extent necessary for existing structures to comply. 
b.  All new construction, expansions, or additions shall comply with the minimum yard requirements of the new district. 
c.  Buffers and landscape areas shall be established by conditions of zoning which shall have precedence over the district standards contained in chapter 74. 
d.  Destruction or removal of buildings which preexisted rezoning shall reinstate the development standards of the then applicable district provisions of this section. 
(6)  Exemptions due to state or city action. Whenever a lot becomes nonconforming as a result of land acquisition by the city or state, building permits shall be granted for new construction provided the proposed structure complies with all but lot area requirements, and setback requirements shall be reduced without requirement for a variance to the extent of the width of the acquired property. Whenever a structure becomes nonconforming as a result of city or state action other than an amendment to this article, the use of the structure may continue and the structure may be replaced as though no nonconformity exists if, subsequent to such action, the structure is destroyed.

Editor's note- At the request of the city, and for the sake of clarity, ch. 80, art. VIII, §§ 80-291-80-296 were renumbered as §§ 80-295-80-300. 

Sec. 80-295. - Requirements for amendments. 
    Whenever the public necessity, convenience, general welfare or good zoning practice justify such action, and after consideration by the city planning and zoning commission, the mayor and council of the city may, by ordinance, amend the regulations set forth in this chapter and may change the zoning districts as established on the official map of the city. 
(Ord. No. 2008-10Z, exh. A, § 12.01, 8-25-2008) 
Sec. 80-296. - Application for or initiation of an amendment. 
    A proposed amendment to a zoning district or zoning text may be initiated by the city planning and zoning commission, the mayor and council of the city or by an application filed with the clerk of the city of one or more owners of property within the area proposed for a zoning amendment. However, a property owner shall not initiate action for a zoning amendment affecting the same parcel more often than once every 12 months, except where the council has approved an ordinance to waive the 12-month waiting period between the filing of applications affecting the same parcel of property. This provision shall not be construed as impairing the right of the planning and zoning commission or the council to propose an amendment at any time on their own initiative. A property owner, with the consent of the planning and zoning commission, may voluntarily withdraw such owner's application or a proposed change of district one time prior to action on the application by the planning and zoning commission. Such withdrawn application shall not be deemed to be initiation of an application for zoning amendment with respect to the parcel of land involved. Any communication purporting to be an application for an amendment shall be regarded as mere notice to seek relief until it is made in the form required. Upon receipt of any such communication, the interested parties shall be supplied with the proper forms for presenting applications.

    No amendment shall be made or become effective until the same shall have been proposed by or be first submitted for review by the city planning and zoning commission. The commission shall transmit its report upon the proposed amendment to the mayor and council within 30 days following the commission meeting at which it was considered. Upon receipt of this report or at the expiration of the 30 day period, the mayor and council of the city may proceed to set a public hearing and consider the such amendment. 
(Ord. No. 2008-10Z, exh. A, § 12.04, 8-25-2008) 
Sec. 80-299. - Public hearing and action by mayor and council. 
(a)  Notice requirements. 
(1)  Before adopting any amendment to the city official zoning map or text of this chapter, the mayor and council shall hold a public hearing thereon, official notice of which shall be given in a newspaper of general circulation in the city, at least 15 days, but not more than 45 days, prior to the hearing. 
(2)  The newspaper notice of the public hearing shall include the time, place and purpose of the hearing. Such notice shall include the location of the property, the present zoning classification and the proposed zoning classification, for amendments involving a change to the zoning classification of a parcel of land. 
(3)  Whenever a proposed amendment to this chapter, initiated by a party other than the city, involves changing the zoning classification of property from one type of zone to another, the mayor and council shall have a sign posted in a conspicuous place on the property not less than 15 days prior to the date of the public hearing. Such posted sign shall be not less than eight square feet in area, and shall contain information as to the proposed zoning change and the date, time and place of the public hearing. Proposed zoning ordinance amendments and proposed revisions to the official zoning map initiated by the city shall not require the posting of signs on affected property; unless the proposed revision includes five or fewer parcels of land. 
(4)  The public hearing by the mayor and council may be continued to the next regular meeting date and for additional meeting dates without further legal notice as good planning practices dictate and the mayor and council deem necessary. The date posted on any official sign advertising the hearing may be changed to reflect the continued hearing date. 
(b)  Policies and procedures for calling and conducting public hearings on zoning. 
(1)  The term "zoning," when used in this subsection, shall mean: 
a.  A legislative act representing a legislative judgment as to how the land within a city should be utilized and where the lines of demarcation between the several use districts should be drawn. 
b.  An exercise of local government's police power wherein the local government attempts to balance the interest of promoting the public health, safety, morality or general welfare against the property owner's right to the unrestricted use of his property. 
(2)  The basic issue to be decided in any zoning hearing is whether a zoning regulation and/or classification bears a reasonable relationship to the public health, safety, morality or general welfare and, therefore, may be justified. 
(3)  Public hearing procedures shall be as follows: 
a.  The mayor and council have mandated that prior to any amendment of the city's zoning ordinance (text or map), the mayor and council will hold a public hearing thereon. Notice of such hearing shall be as provided in subsection (a) of this section. 
b.  All hearings shall be conducted by the mayor and council, with the mayor presiding. The mayor shall indicate that a public hearing has been called for consideration of a zoning amendment. the mayor and council shall consider each application on an individual basis. 
c.  At the public hearing, the mayor shall ask for a show of hands of those persons who are in support of the application. The applicant and those persons wishing to appear in support of the application shall have not less than ten minutes to present positions in support of the application, provided that if the number of persons wishing to appear in support of the application is in excess of that which may reasonably be heard, the mayor may request that a spokesman for the group be chosen so that the entire presentation of the positions of those in support of the application shall not exceed 30 minutes. 
d.  After the comments and concerns of those in favor of the zoning amendment have been heard, the mayor will ask for a show of hands of those persons in opposition to the application. Those persons wishing to appear in opposition to the application shall have not less than ten minutes to present positions in opposition of the application, provided however that if the number of persons wishing to appear in opposition to the application is in excess of that which may reasonably be heard, the mayor may request that a spokesman for the group be chosen so that the entire presentation of the positions of those in opposition to the application shall not exceed 30 minutes. 
e.  After comments and concerns of the public have been heard, the mayor and council may request a report from officers or agents of the city. 
f.  The applicant for the zoning amendment shall be allowed up to five minutes for rebuttal and final comment. 
g.  After the above procedures have been completed, the mayor will indicate that the public hearing is formally closed. 
(4)  The mayor and council shall take the following actions following the public hearing: 
a.  The mayor and council will take action to approve or deny the proposed zoning amendment. The decision of the council is by a majority of the council members present. The mayor will vote only in case of a tie vote. In such case, the mayor votes in order to resolve the question. The vote will be taken in public and announced to those present. 
b.  If the zoning decision of the mayor and council is for the rezoning of property and the amendment to the zoning ordinance to accomplish the rezoning is denied by the mayor and council, then the same property owner or his authorized agent or representative may not again apply for rezoning on the same property until the expiration of at least of at least 12 months immediately following the denial of the rezoning by the mayor and council, except; provided, however, that unless otherwise provided by state law, the council may approve an ordinance to waive the 12 month waiting period between the denial of an application and the filing of a new application affecting the same parcel of property. This provision shall not be construed as impairing the right of the planning and zoning commission or the council to propose an amendment at any time on their own initiative unless otherwise precluded from doing so under state law. 
(Ord. No. 2008-10Z, exh. A, § 12.05, 8-25-2008) 
Sec. 80-300. - Standards governing the exercise of zoning powers. 
(a)  In ruling upon any application for a zoning map amendment, or any other zoning decision, the mayor and council shall act in the best interest of the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the city. In doing so, they will consider one or more of the following standards of review which are relevant to the application: 
(1)  Whether the proposal is consistent and/or compatible with the city's plans, goals and objectives reflected in the city's comprehensive plan. 
(2)  How the proposal impacts the purposes of the overall zoning scheme, and whether the proposed change furthers the purposes of these zoning regulations. Applications for zoning amendments that do not contain specific site plans carry a rebuttable presumption that the proposed change shall adversely affect the zoning scheme. 
(3)  How the proposal impacts the character of the zoning district, the particular piece of property, neighborhoods, or the community. 
(4)  Whether the proposal creates an isolated district unrelated to adjacent properties and nearby districts. 
(5)  How the proposal impacts the aesthetic character of existing and future uses of the property and the surrounding area. 
(6)  Whether the proposal is consistent with adjacent development densities and the density patterns reflected in the comprehensive plan. 
(7)  How the proposal impacts the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(8)  How the proposal impacts water, sewerage, other public facilities, or public services, and how the proposed amendment impacts expenditures of public funds. 
(9)  How the proposal impacts traffic safety and congestion. 
(10)  How the proposal impacts environmental conditions, including, but not limited to, drainage, soil erosion and sedimentation, flooding, air quality, water quality and quantity. 
(11)  How the proposal impacts the provision of adequate light and air. 
(12)  How the proposal impacts the value of adjacent property. 
(13)  Whether there are substantial reasons why the property cannot be used in accordance with existing regulations. 
(14)  Preservation of the integrity of residential neighborhoods shall carry greater weight than other factors. Where property fronts on a major thoroughfare and also adjoins an established residential neighborhood, the factor of preservation of the residential area shall carry greater weight. 
(b)  After hearing evidence at the zoning hearing, the mayor and council shall apply the evidence to the standards of review in making their decision. The mayor and council are not required to consider every criterion in the standards of review. The applicant carries the burden of proof that the proposed zoning map amendment promotes the public health, safety, morality or general welfare. 
(c)  If the mayor and council determine from the evidence presented that the applicant has shown that the proposed zoning map amendment promotes the health, safety, morals or general welfare under the standards of review, then the application shall be granted, subject to those reasonable conditions that may be imposed by the mayor and council. Otherwise, such applications shall be denied. 
(d)  In ruling upon any petition in which the petitioner has brought a challenge to the existing zoning classification, the mayor and council shall follow these general lines of inquiry: 
(1)  The existing uses and zoning of the subject and surrounding property. 
(2)  The extent to which property values may be diminished by the particular zoning restrictions. 
(3)  The extent to which the reduction of property values, if any, promotes the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public. 
(4)  The relative gain to the public, as compared to the hardship, if any, imposed upon the individual property owner. 
(5)  The suitability of subject property for development purposes as presently zoned. 
(6)  The length of time the property, if vacant, has been vacant as zoned, considered in the context of land development in the vicinity of the property. 
(e)  The existing zoning classification shall be presumed to be valid; it shall be the responsibility of the applicant to present evidence to rebut this presumption. 
(f)  If the mayor and council determine, from the evidence presented, that the existing zoning classification is unduly burdensome to the applicant and is not offset by consideration of the public's health, safety, morals and general welfare, and consideration of the integrity of this chapter and of the official zoning map, the mayor and council may impose any appropriate zoning classification, including allowable conditions, which might be consistent with the considerations outlined in subsection (a) of this section.

Sec. 80-329. - Location. 
    In the event required off-street vehicle parking cannot be reasonably accommodated on the same property on which the principal, building, structure or use is conducted, an administrative permit for off-site parking may be considered in accordance with the provisions of article IV. 
(Ord. No. 2008-10Z, exh. A, § 13.03, 8-25-2008; Ord. No. 2012-14, § 1, 12-10-2012) 
Sec. 80-330. - Joint use of required off-street parking spaces. 
    The standards for shared parking may be utilized for any of the combinations of uses shown below on any number of properties when approval is reflected in the conditions of zoning for each such property. Similar provisions are provided under off-site and shared parking requirements in the use permits article for those uses which were not zoned concurrently or as part of a multiple use project. The conditions of zoning or use permit, as applicable, establish the limits of parking requirements among uses and properties, and the city shall not require any contractual relationship among property owners. 
    The standards for determining parking requirements in a multiple use development are: 
(1)  Determine the minimum amount of parking required for each separate use. 
(2)  Multiply each parking requirement by the corresponding percentage for each of the time periods given below. 
(3)  Calculate the column total parking requirement for each time period. 
(4)  The largest column total is the shared parking requirement.

    Properties proposed for individual uses would require the following number of parking spaces: 
Office 300 spaces Retail 280 spaces Entertainment 100 spaces Total 680 spaces  
    Properties proposed for multiple uses under the provisions for shared parking would require the following number of parking spaces:

ARTICLE X. - BUFFERS AND OPEN SPACE 

Sec. 80-365. - Definitions. 
    Buffer. A portion of a tract which is permanently set aside to provide a perceived or actual visual (or horizontal spatial) separation between the use on the tract and abutting tracts through the use of natural vegetation or other means including replanting or the provision of supplemental plantings or other visual screening elements or noise attenuation devices. Buffers shall remain undisturbed except as required to implement landscape enhancement. 
    Open space. A portion of a site which is permanently set aside for public or private use and will not be developed. The space may be used for passive or active recreation or may be reserved to protect or buffer natural areas. Open space may include wooded areas other than required landscape strips and buffers, pathways/walkways, fields and sensitive environmental areas such as wetlands, etc. Detention facilities and platted residential lots shall not be included in open space calculations. 
(Ord. No. 2012-14, § 1, 12-10-2012) 
Sec. 80-366. - Purpose. 
    Buffers are intended to protect adjacent or other properties from potential nuisances associated with neighboring uses and to protect the public from unsightly views along public rights-of-way. Such nuisances may include dust, litter, odor, noise, glare, and unsightly buildings, uses or parking areas. They are further intended to preserve and enhance the aesthetic qualities, character, privacy, and land values of property within the city. Buffers may also be required by zoning conditions or other formal approvals. 
(Ord. No. 2008-10Z, exh. A, § 14.01, 8-25-2008; Ord. No. 2012-14, § 1, 12-10-2012) 
Sec. 80-367. - Location. 
    Buffers shall be located along the common property lines between abutting zoning districts. Buffers shall be placed on the more intense zoning district and shall be required even if the abutting property is unimproved land. (Generally, industrially zoned districts are considered to allow more intense uses and single family residential less intense uses.) Property zoned DP-6, RM-4, RM-8, R-CT, M-1 and M-2 shall have a 25 feet buffer along all public right-of-way. No buffer shall be located on, nor any portion thereof credited for, any portion of an existing public or private street right-of-way. 
(Ord. No. 2008-10Z, exh. A, § 14.02, 8-25-2008; Ord. No. 2012-14, § 1, 12-10-2012) 
Sec. 80-368. - Use of buffers. 
    A buffers may be used for passive recreation; however, no plant material may be removed from any required buffer, except as provided for in section 80-369 associated with buffer maintenance. 
(Ord. No. 2008-10Z, exh. A, § 14.03, 8-25-2008; Ord. No. 2012-14, § 1, 12-10-2012) 
Sec. 80-369. - Buffers part of required yards. 
    Buffers may be established within the required front, side or rear yard and the dimension of the buffer shall be credited toward the required yard dimension. However, no land disturbing activity may occur in the buffer except as required to implement landscape enhancement. 
(Ord. No. 2008-10Z, exh. A, § 14.04, 8-25-2008; Ord. No. 2012-14, § 1, 12-10-2012) 
Sec. 80-370. - Buffer maintenance. 
(a)  Buffers are considered as permanent improvements and shall be permanently maintained in the same manner as buildings, parking facilities and utility structures. All plant material, fencing and earth berms depicted on the approved plans for any development shall be maintained or replaced to reflect the approved plans. Any degradation in the effectiveness of the approved buffer shall be considered a violation of this chapter. 
(b)  Natural buffers comprised of existing plant materials shall be preserved during site construction, and conform to standards established for the district as provided herein. All such plants to be preserved shall be protected in accordance with chapter 74. 
(Ord. No. 2008-10Z, exh. A, § 14.05, 8-25-2008; Ord. No. 2012-14, § 1, 12-10-2012) 
Sec. 80-371. - Buffer standards. 
    Buffers shall afford the maximum level of buffering necessitated by the land uses adjoining the required buffer. All buffers shall provide complete visual obstruction of the adjoining property. If the buffer area cannot achieve this level of obstruction in its natural state, landscape enhancement shall be required. Visual obstruction shall occur through the use of existing or provided evergreen plant material having the ability through its varietal height, shape and/or density to obstruct visibility through the buffer area from ground level to a height of 12 feet. Buffers shall attain satisfactory achievement of complete visual obstruction within two years of planting. Any landscaping shall be in accordance with chapter 74. 
    All buffers shall be subject to approval by the planning and zoning commission. Buffer requirements may be expanded where circumstances of topography or other factors render normal buffers ineffective. 
(Ord. No. 2008-10Z, exh. A, § 14.06, 8-25-2008; Ord. No. 2012-14, § 1, 12-10-2012) 
Sec. 80-372. - District buffer standards. 
    Minimum required buffer width by zoning district: 
When DP-6, RM-4, RM-8, R-CT, or O&I zoned properties abut a single family residential district, DC-1, or DC-2 zoned property; a 25 feet buffer shall be required. 
When C-1, C-2, C-3, M-1, or M-2 zoned properties abut all other zoning districts; a 50 feet buffer shall be required. 
(Ord. No. 2008-10Z, exh. A, § 14.07, 8-25-2008; Ord. No. 2012-14, § 1, 12-10-2012) 
Sec. 80-373. - Open space reservation. 
(a)  Development projects which, by virtue of density or extent, have the potential to remove significant areas of open space from the natural environment shall reserve a minimum percentage of the project's land area as open space. The purpose of this reservation is two-fold: 
(1)  The first purpose is related to the rural character of the city as a resource, which has attracted residents. As is true of many rural areas, intensive development tends to spoil much of the resource originally responsible for that growth. Therefore, in order to protect the city's quality living environments, all development of sites in RM-4, RM-8, R-CT, O&I, C-3, M-1, M-2 and PD districts shall preserve open areas according to the following formula: 
a.  Projects which disturb areas of open space greater than one-acre shall retain a minimum of 30 percent of the gross site acreage in permanent open space. 
b.  Projects which disturb areas of open space greater than one-acre and provide a variety of site amenities, including but not limited to walking paths or trails, benches, lighting, picnic areas, and recreation facilities, shall retain a minimum of 20 percent of the gross site acreage in improved open space. 
c.  Projects which disturb areas of open space greater than one-acre and provide site amenities consistent with the provisions of subsection (a)(1)b., and link those areas to similar areas on adjoining property which currently exist or could reasonably be utilized as open space, shall retain a minimum of ten percent of the gross site acreage in improved open space. 
(2)  The second purpose of the open space reservation is related to the storm drainage pattern of the city. As a rural community, the city relies on surface runoff systems, and has no significant infrastructure in storm drainage. This system depends on a great deal of porous surfaces and open areas to function properly. The cost of construction of a storm drainage utility system is prohibitive. As a result, the city must protect its open areas and natural storm drainage system. This protection will be achieved through enforcement of the provisions of this section in all development projects proposed for RM-4, RM-8, R-CT, O&I, C-3, M-1, M-2 and PD districts on sites greater than one-acre. 
(b)  Projects which alter the site's natural drainage system by grading an area greater than 50 percent of the gross acreage of the site, or by installing drainage structures requiring piping above 18 inches in diameter shall retain 30 percent of the gross acreage in open space. 
(c)  Projects which preserve natural drainage swales and associated areas in permanent, natural settings shall retain 20 percent of the gross acreage in open space. 
(d)  Projects which preserve natural drainage swales and associated areas in permanent, natural settings, and which are linked to natural drainage routes on adjoining properties, shall retain ten percent of the gross acreage in open space. 
(e)  Acreage on development sites affected by this section encompassed by natural water features, floodplains or areas preserved as greenbelts or wetlands may be credited toward the open space reservation. The requirements of this section are, however, in addition to those required under article IX. 
(f)  Required yard areas are not credited toward the open space reservation.

(Ord. No. 2013-08, § 1(exh. A), 6-10-2013; Ord. No. 2014-23, § 1(exh. A), 11-10-2014; Ord. No. 2015-24, § 1(exh. A), 12-14-2015; Ord. No. 2015-27, § 1(exh. A), 12-14-2015; Ord. No. 2016-05, § 1(exh. A), 5-23-2016) 
Sec. 80-428. - Purpose. 
    The mayor and council find that: 
(1)  Proper regulation of signs is a necessary prerequisite to a peaceable, orderly, and safely designed business environment. 
(2)  The purposes of these sign regulations are to encourage the effective use of signs as a means of communication in the city. 
(3)  An improperly regulated sign environment imposes health and safety dangers to the public. 
(4)  The result of effective sign regulation will be to lessen hazardous conditions, confusion, and visual clutter, caused by the proliferation, improper placement, illumination and excessive height and size of signs that compete for the attention of pedestrian and vehicular traffic, and impede vision of traffic, traffic controls signs, and devices. 
(5)  Uncontrolled and unlimited signs may result in a roadside clutter that impedes the flow of information thereby defeating the purpose of signage, and that impedes the flow of information from traffic signs and signals thereby creating hazards to drivers and pedestrians. 
(6)  Uncontrolled and unlimited signs degrade the aesthetic attractiveness of the natural and manmade attributes of the community and thereby undermine the economic value of tourism, visitation, and permanent economic growth. 
(7)  Through proper regulation of signs, the attractiveness and economic well-being of the City of Fairburn will be enhanced as a place to live, work and conduct business. 
(8)  Signs provide an important medium through which individuals may convey a variety of noncommercial and commercial messages. However, left unregulated, signs can become a threat to public safety as well as a traffic hazard. Such signs may also constitute an aesthetic nuisance and be a detriment to property values and the city's public welfare. The mayor and council intend by enacting this article to: 
a.  Balance the rights of individuals to convey their message through signs and the right of the public to be protected against the unrestricted proliferation of signs; 
b.  Further the objectives of the city's comprehensive plan; 
c.  Protect the public health, safety, welfare, and aesthetics of the city; 
d.  Reduce traffic and pedestrian hazards; 
e.  Improve pedestrian and traffic safety; 
f.  Maintain the historical image of the city; 
g.  Protect property values by minimizing the potentially adverse effects and visual blight caused by signs; 
h.  Promote economic development and growth; 
i.  Protect the public traveling along the highways from distractions, aesthetic desecration, and nuisances, all associated with the proliferation of signs in a concentrated area along the highway (Turner Communications Corp. v. Georgia Dept. of Transp., 139 Ga. App. 436, 228 S.E.2d 399 (1976)); and 
j.  Ensure the fair and consistent enforcement of sign regulations. 
(9)  Further, the city has an obligation and a right to protect the rights of adjoining landowners to adequate light and air, to promote desirable living conditions and the sustained stability of neighborhoods, to protect property against blight and deprivation, and encourage the most appropriate use of land, buildings, and other structures throughout the city. 
(10)  The city's intention in enacting sign legislation has never been directed at nor enforced against the content of the signs, but has rather focused on the physical characteristics of the sign structures. 
(11)  The city finds that some signage has a single targeted function and that identification of such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function. For instance, signs at the entrances to subdivisions of developments are for the purpose of providing guidance and to enable both the traveling public and public safety personnel responding to emergencies to quickly locate entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency calls. While such signage is referenced based upon the function it serves within the context of this chapter, the provisions of this chapter are unrelated to the content of the speech provided and allow the maximum expressive potential to sign owners. The city further finds that holiday decorations are not signs, but rather seasonal ornamentation not controlled by this chapter. 
(12)  Accordingly, in consideration of the city's rights and obligations to promote traffic safety, to preserve property values, to provide for the convenience and enjoyment of public travel, to eliminate annoyance to travelers, to attract tourists, residents and industry, to serve the public health, safety and morals, to advance the general prosperity of the community, and to serve the general welfare, the city hereby imposes the regulations contained in this article. 
(13)  The city council finds that there is a compelling state interest in the city and state being able to safely regulate the speed, direction and flow of vehicular and pedestrian traffic in and around public roads, streets and sidewalks, and quasi-public roads, streets and sidewalks in private property where the general public, invited by the owner, routinely and customarily to enters, transverses, and parks by vehicle and/or by foot. The city has a compelling state interest in the public safety and welfare of motorist and pedestrians in these areas, the safe and expedient access of public safety vehicles such as police, fire and rescue equipment to such areas. The city has a compelling state interest to regulate vehicular and pedestrian traffic such as to prevent or minimize collisions and the injury or death to persons caused thereby, or the damage to property, both public and private. Therefore, the city determines that there is a compelling state interest in the city's police chief regulating the type, traffic control message and placement of all traffic control signs and devices in the areas described above. The city also has a compelling state interest in insuring that private entities are not allowed to display in the areas described above, signs that imitate or emulate traffic instructional and control signs, devices or messages in such a way as may reasonably be mistaken by the public as true traffic control signs or devices, and thereby could reasonably be expected to cause a motorist or pedestrian to make an improper maneuver which will place the motorist or pedestrian or other motorist or pedestrian in danger of collision or injury due to such improper maneuver. Therefore, the city has a compelling state interest in regulating such signs in the areas described above which imitate or emulate a traffic instructional and control sign or device and which may reasonably be confusing to motorists or pedestrians in these areas.

Upon the filing of an application for an authorization and permit and the payment of all necessary fees as required by this section, the zoning administrator shall examine all plans and specifications submitted and the premises upon which the proposed sign is to be erected, and if it shall appear that the proposed sign is in compliance with all the requirements of this article and all other ordinances and laws of the city, and if a business, that the business has registered and paid any tax due pursuant to the city's occupation tax chapter, he/she shall then issue an authorization to erect the sign pursuant to the application and any conditions placed upon the authorization by the city. If the work authorized thereby has not been completed within 180 days after the date of issuance and a final permit has not been requested in writing, the authorization shall become null and void and no final permit may be issued. 
(g)  Appeal procedure. Any applicant who is dissatisfied by the zoning administrator's interpretation of the sign ordinance may appeal such decision to the planning and zoning commission, pursuant to Article VI Appeals, Section 80-255. Such appeal shall be in writing and shall be filed with the zoning administrator, within ten days of the decision being appeal. The planning and zoning commission will schedule the matter for hearing within 45 days of the appeal being filed, pursuant to section 80-273. The planning and zoning commission shall make its final determination on the appeal within ten days of the close of the hearing. 
(h)  Within ten days after completion of the erection of a sign pursuant to an approved application and an authorization to erect, and within 180 days of the issuance of an authorization, the applicant shall deliver to the zoning administrator a written request for a final permit along with current and dated color photographs of each face of the sign (at least three inches by five inches in size) and a signed affidavit that the photographs are current and accurate photographs of the sign's faces as of the date on the photographs, that the sign was and is erected as described in the application as conditioned and authorized by the city, including the size, location, building materials, height and lighting. Within ten business days of the filing of a request for a final permit, the zoning administrator shall issue the final permit or deny the final permit because of the applicant's failure to properly and timely submit the written request for final permit, failure to properly and timely document the request, or failure to properly and timely erect the sign as described in the application conditioned and authorized by the city. Notification of a denial shall be effectuated pursuant to subsection (d) above, and the applicant shall have the appeal rights as provided at subsection (g). Failure of the zoning administrator to approve or deny the application for a final sign permit within said ten business days of the applicant properly and timely filing with the city a fully and properly documented application for final permit shall constitute an approval of the final permit. 
(i)  An applicant who has failed to complete the erection of a sign within 180 days of the issuance of an authorization or who fails to request a final permit within ten days of erection of a sign pursuant to an authorization or who fails to apply for a final permit within 180 days of the issuance of an authorization or who's request for a final permit is denied, shall remove the sign or parts of the sign within 30 days of notice from the zoning administrator to remove the sign or parts of the sign. Failure to so remove the sign shall constitute a separate ordinance violation for each day that the sign or part of the sign is not removed from the proposed site and upon conviction, the applicant and/or owner or tenant of the sign site shall be guilty of an ordinance violation and shall be subject to fines or imprisonment as authorized by the city's Charter. 
(j)  Furthermore, if the sign or part of the sign is not removed within said 30 days, the city may remove the sign or part of the sign and charge the applicant and/or owner of the site the cost of removal and disposal. 
(k)  Any person aggrieved by a final decision of the city shall have the right of certiorari to the superior court within 30 days after the date of the written decision.

(7)  Highway 29 Overlay District Signs . The purpose of the Highway 29 Overlay District Sign Ordinance [this subsection] is to ensure the district's signage is harmonious in proportion, form, color, and materials to the character of the overlay district. Visual relatedness is crucial to the goal of an integrated Highway 29 Overlay District, which includes the Historic Downtown Commercial District, and signs play a key role in helping to preserve this district's sense of time and place, and achieve the desired effect of charm and compatibility. The ordinance allows businesses to maintain their individual identities, and also become identified with the overlay and downtown historic district as a whole. To resolve the technical and aesthetic questions of signage, and encourage high quality in design, the signs within this district shall comply with section 80-89 of the Highway 29 Overlay District ordinance. Section 80-89 contains appropriate sign/design examples and is incorporated herein by reference. 
a.  Applicability . This subsection shall apply only to those building structures and uses within the geographical boundaries of the Highway 29 Overlay District, as established and defined in section 80-89 of the city's zoning ordinance. 
b.  Compatibility . As to signs, buildings, structures, and uses within the Highway 29 Overlay District, when a provision of this section conflicts with any section in the balance of chapter 80 of the Code, the provision of this section shall control. Otherwise, to the extent reasonably possible, the provisions of this section shall be interpreted consistent with the provisions of the balance of chapter 80 of this Code. 
c.  Signage standards .

Inside the Highway 29 Overlay District businesses may utilize awning signs, A-frame and sandwich board signs, projecting/hanging/suspended signs, monument signs, wall/signboard signs, and window signs. Acceptable lettering materials include wood, stone, synthetic stone, metal, vinyl, dimensional plastic, acrylic, or high-density polystyrene foam. The overall design of all signage shall be compatible with the turn-of-the-century-theme. The typeset or lettering used shall be taken from, or compatible with, the typeset choices listed in Highway 29 Overlay District ordinance, subsection 80-89(m). 
3.  Materials. Signs may be constructed of concrete, brick, wood, stone, metal, glass, or synthetic materials that have the same appearance of the aforementioned natural materials due to their finish. All materials shall be compatible with the building's architecture, and should be colorfast and resistant to corrosion. Signs shall be professionally finished in accordance with the material selected, whether by sanding, painting, staining and/or sealing, with the edges of the sign framed out and/or sealed. 
4.  Lighting. All signs in the overlay district, whether freestanding signs or wall/building signs, shall only be illuminated by an external light source, and through craftsmanship and materials, shall reflect downtown district design aesthetics. (See Subsection 80-89(o) of the Highway 29 Overlay District Ordinance.) 
5.  Colors. Signs, and all lettering, symbols, and embellishments contained therein, shall be furnished in colors either contained in or consistent with the Typeset and Color Guide for the Highway 29 Overlay District Signage or from any commercially available historic color palette.

Sec. 80-472. - Definitions. 
(a)  For the purposes of this section, the term "infill" shall apply to all single-family residential zoning within the districts. 
(b)  For the purposes of this section, "accessory structure" shall mean detached garages, carports, storage sheds, etc. and shall meet the minimum setback requirements prescribed by the applicable zoning district. Said structures shall be constructed of similar building materials and orientation of the principal structure. 
(c)  For the purposes of this section, the term "infill development" shall mean the construction of single-family dwellings and/or reconstruction of at least 25 percent of the exterior of a residential structure in neighborhoods in which at least 75 percent of the lots in the survey area have been developed. Infill development shall be required if a developer is building five or less homes. A single-family detached structure constructed on three acres or more is exempt from this chapter. 
(d)  For purposes of this section, the term "survey area" shall mean: 
The nearest ten surrounding single-family residential properties that are located on both sides, directly to the rear, and directly across the public right-of-way of the lot to be developed. 
In the event that topography, zoning district boundaries, city limits, or other logistical matters render strict compliance with subsection (d) impossible, the director of planning and zoning shall determine the survey area as strictly as possible in compliance with subsection (d). 
(1)  In order to establish and maintain compatibility among residential developments and to preserve the aesthetic qualities of neighborhoods, which serves to preserve the property values of all residential land owners and developers, promote the health, welfare and safety of neighborhoods, and preserve the tax base of the city, the design requirements detailed herein are hereby mandated for all residential infill developments, in addition to all other construction standards contained in this Code. 
(2)  The developer of a proposed infill development shall submit to the planning and zoning department, an infill compatibility survey, on the form provided by the planning and zoning department that illustrates the size, scale, and overall visual character of the structure including setbacks, height and basic architectural features of homes in the survey area. The applicant shall also submit labeled pictures of the survey area. 
(e)  The minimum requirements for residential infill development, to be shown on the infill compatibility survey, shall be as follows: 
(1)  Height. The maximum height is measured between the highest point along a roof or highest ridge line of a proposed home, and the slab or crawl space on grade. The height shall comply with the requirements of the applicable zoning district. For purposes of building height, chimneys, as well as flues, vents, pipes, antennae, and other small projections less than 24 inches in width/diameter (measured at the widest point) shall not be included in the above measurement. 
(2)  Number of stories. The number of stores shall comply with the height requirements of the applicable zoning district. 
(3)  Orientation of the front door. The home shall have its front entrance facing the street (if the lot faces more than one street, then facing the street that existing homes in the survey area face), and shall have no less than 25 square feet of framed window facing said street, or no less than 85 percent of the average square footage of framed window facing said street for homes within the survey area, whichever is less. 
(4)  Orientation of the house. The infill home shall have the same orientation to the streets as the majority (51 percent) of the existing homes within the survey area. Where the dimensions of the lot, or other site-specific obstacles, do not permit the same orientation as a majority of existing structures in the survey area, the property owner, or his or her representatives, may file for a variance with the planning and zoning commission, which variance shall be considered in conformance with the procedures and standards contained in article VI-Appeals. 
(5)  Garages and carports. Where a majority (51 percent) of existing homes have garages or carports within the survey area, the infill home shall include a garage or carport. The garage or carport frontage shall meet all setback requirements of the applicable zoning district. The orientation of garages and carports shall be consistent with the majority (51 percent) of such structures within the survey area. Where possible, garages and carports shall be oriented and entered from the side or rear of the infill home, and out of view of the public way. A detached garage within an infill development is considered an accessory structure and must comply with the infill standards and applicable zoning district. 
(6)  Exterior materials. The exterior materials of an infill development, including garages, carports and other accessory structures, shall conform to the following requirements: 
a.  All exterior finishes shall be either brick, stone, masonry, wood, masonry composite, or such other similar exterior finish as may be approved by the director of planning and zoning. 
b.  Where either brick, stone, masonry, wood, or masonry composite is used on a majority (51 percent) of existing homes in the survey area, the infill development shall include and reflect the majority (51 percent) of the homes' building materials on the front, sides and rear of the structure as demonstrated in the community and if visible from a public right-of-way.

(10)  Front porch or stoops. Where the majority (51 percent) of existing homes in the survey area have a functional front porch or stoop, or similar front entry feature, the infill home shall have such a feature. The inclusion of these features shall be consistent with the setbacks of the applicable zoning district. Architectural features and dimensions shall conform to those of the majority (51 percent) of homes in the survey area. 
(11)  Overhangs. The roofs of all infill homes shall be constructed in such a manner as to provide soffits (i.e. the horizontal underside of the eaves) that extend a maximum horizontal distance of one foot beyond the face of the exterior walls.

Sec. 80-473. - Public participation program. 
    The public participation program is in place to ensure that applicants pursue early effective public involvement in conjunction with their petitions, ensure that the citizens of the city have an adequate opportunity to learn about petitions that may affect them, and to ensure ongoing communication between applicants, adjoining property owners, neighborhood groups, community associations and other organizations, elected officials and city staff. A minimum target area for public participation shall be a 500-foot radius from the affected property. At the director of planning and zoning's discretion, a greater distance may be required. Applicants are required to submit a public participation plan for meeting with interested citizens to advise residents of residential infill applications and to allow citizens the opportunity to discuss concerns and provide input about project design or development. An applicant's responsibilities are to inform the public, solicit input, and provide a summary of these activities in the form of a written report. 
    The requirement for a public participation plan does not give communities decision making powers. Applicants are encouraged to listen to the concerns of the community and seek to reach a consensus on the outstanding issues. A refusal by the community, as defined in section 80-474, to meet with applicants or to return the completed and signed departmental documents does not mean that the applicant fails to meet the requirements of the public participation program. 
    Public participation plans are required with all residential infill applications and must be filed simultaneously with the application. An application for building permit may be denied by the department of planning and zoning if the report is not submitted as required.

    Minimum Standards : 
(1)  Identification of all property owners within 500-foot radius of the site, area neighborhood groups, community associations, other organizations and any political subdivision of the state (elected officials) which may be affected by an application.

(Ord. No. 2012-04, § 1(Exh. A), 6-11-2012) 
Sec. 80-476. - Community responsibility. 
    The affected community and/or other interested parties shall also fax, mail, e-mail or hand deliver to the department of planning and zoning a copy of the signed notification form by both parties in order to insure that the information submitted by the applicant reflects what was presented to the community and/or other interested parties. The form must be submitted within five days after the scheduled meeting. If the form is not submitted, the information submitted by the applicant will be deemed to be the information presented to the community and/or other interested parties.
