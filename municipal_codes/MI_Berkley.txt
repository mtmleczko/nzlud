PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Berkley, Michigan. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1981 Code, as supplemented through August 16, 1993, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1981 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of the editorial staff of Municipal Code Corporation. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to the city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.

The amount spread in each case shall be based upon the detailed estimate of the city manager as approved by the council. 
Sec. 12.11. - Assessor to attach certificate to assessment roll. 
    When the assessor completes such assessment roll, it shall be filed with the clerk for presentation to the council for review and certification. 
Sec. 12.12. - Meeting to review special assessment roll; objections in writing. 
    Upon receipt of such special assessment roll, the council, by resolution, shall accept such assessment roll and order it to be filed in the office of the clerk for public examination; shall fix the time and place the council will meet to review such special assessment roll; and shall direct the clerk to publish a notice of a public hearing for the purpose of giving an opportunity for interested persons to be heard. Such notice shall be made by publication and by first class mail addressed to the owners of the property affected by the proposed improvement at least one week prior to the holding of the hearing. The hearing required by this section may be held at any regular, adjourned or special meeting of the council. At this meeting, all interested persons or parties shall present their objections, if any, to the assessments against them in writing. The assessor shall be present at every meeting of the council at which a special assessment is to be reviewed. 
Sec. 12.13. - Changes and corrections in assessment roll. 
    The council shall meet at the time and place designated for the review of such special assessment roll and, at such meeting, or proper adjournment thereof, shall consider all objections thereto submitted in writing. The council may correct said roll as to any special assessment or description of any lot or parcel of land or other errors appearing therein; or it may, by resolution, annul such assessment roll, and the same proceedings shall be followed in making a new roll as in the making of the original roll. If, after hearing all objections and making a record of such changes as the council deems justified, the council is satisfied with said special assessment roll, it shall thereupon pass a resolution confirming such roll, placing it on file in the office of the clerk, and directing the clerk to certify the copy within ten days, therein commanding the assessor to spread the various sums and amounts appearing thereon on a special assessment roll or upon the tax rolls of the city for the full amounts, or in annual installments as directed by the council. Such rolls shall have the date of confirmation endorsed thereon and shall, from that date, be final and conclusive for the purpose of the improvement to which it applies, subject only to adjustment to conform to the actual cost of the improvement, as provided in section 12.19 of this chapter. 
Sec. 12.14. - Collection of special assessments. 
    All special assessments, except such installments thereof as the council shall make payable at a future time, as provided in this chapter, shall be due and payable upon confirmation of the special assessment roll. 
Sec. 12.15. - Partial payments; when due. 
    The council may provide for the payment of special assessments in annual installments. Such annual installments shall not exceed ten in number, the first installment being due upon confirmation of the roll and the deferred installments being due annually thereafter or, in the discretion of the council, may be spread upon and made a part of each annual city tax roll thereafter, until all annual installments have been spread. Interest shall be charged on all deferred installments at a rate not to exceed six percent per annum, payable annually; the whole or any deferred installments, with interest accrued thereon, to the date of payment, may be paid in advance of the due dates herein established. 
Sec. 12.16. - Delinquent special assessments. 
    Special assessments and all interest and charges thereon, from the date of confirmation of the roll, shall be and remain a lien upon the property assessed of the same character and effect as the lien created by general law for state and county taxes, and by this charter for city taxes, until paid. From such date after confirmation, as shall be fixed by the council, the same penalties and interest shall be collected on delinquent special assessments and upon delinquent installments of such special assessment as are provided by this charter to be collected on delinquent city taxes. The lands upon which the same are a lien shall be subject to sale therefor the same as are delinquent city taxes and the lands upon which they constitute a lien. 
Sec. 12.17. - Hazards and nuisances. 
    When any lot, building or structure within the city, becomes, in the opinion of the council, a public hazard or nuisance which is dangerous to public health, safety or welfare, the council may, after investigation, give notice by registered mail, addressed to the last known address of the owner or owners of the land upon which such nuisance exists, or to the owner of the building or structure itself, specifying the nature of the nuisance and requiring such owner to alter, repair, tear down, abate or remove the nuisance within a time to be specified by the council, which shall be commensurate with the nature of the nuisance. If, at the expiration of the time limit in said notice, the owner has not complied with the requirements thereof, or in any case where the owner of the land or of the building or structure itself is not known, the council may order such hazard or nuisance abated by the proper department or agency of the city which is qualified to do the work required, or may do the work by contract or by hire and the cost of such abatement addressed against the lot, premises or description of real property upon which such hazard or nuisance is located, by special assessment. 
Sec. 12.18. - Amount; council to determine. 
    The council shall determine what amount or part of each such expense shall be charged, and the person, if known, against whom, and the premises upon which the same shall be levied as a special assessment; and as often as the council shall deem it expedient, it shall require all of the several amounts so reported and determined, and the several lots or premises and the persons chargeable therewith, respectively, to be notified by the clerk either by registered mail sent to their last known address as shown on the assessment roll of the city or by publication. Such notice shall state the basis of the assessment, the cost thereof and shall give a reasonable time, which shall not be less than 30 days, in which payment shall be made. In all cases where payment is not made within the time limit, the same shall be reported by the clerk to the assessor who shall spread such amounts against the several persons or descriptions of real property chargeable therewith on the next roll for the collection of city taxes. 
Sec. 12.19. - Additional assessments; refunds. 
    The city manager shall, within 60 days after the completion of each local or special public improvement, compile the actual cost thereof and certify the same to the assessor, who shall adjust the special assessment roll to correspond therewith, subject to the limitation contained in section 12.10. When any special assessment roll shall prove insufficient to meet the costs of the improvement for which it was made, the council may make an additional pro rata assessment, but the total assessed shall not exceed the maximum amount permitted by section 12.10. Should the assessment prove larger than necessary by five percent or less, the same shall be reported to the council which may place the excess in the city treasury or make a refund thereof pro rata according to the assessments. If the assessment exceeds five percent, the entire excess shall be refunded to owners of property upon which payments have been made in full pro rata according to assessments. 
Sec. 12.20. - Special assessment accounts. 
    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, moneys raised by special assessment to pay the cost of any local improvement shall be held in a special fund to pay such cost or to repay any money borrowed therefor. Each special assessment account must be used only for the improvement project for which the assessment was levied, except as otherwise provided in this chapter. 
Sec. 12.21. - Contested assessments. 
    Except and unless notice is given to the council in writing of an intention to contest or enjoin the collection of any special assessment for the construction of any public improvement, or the removal or abatement of any public hazard or nuisance, within 15 days after the date of the resolution of the council confirming the assessment roll for such improvement, as required by section 12.12 of this chapter, which notice shall state the grounds on which the proceedings are to be contested, no suit or action of any kind shall be instituted or maintained for the purpose of contesting or enjoining the collection of such special assessment. 
Sec. 12.22. - Reassessment for benefits. 
    Whenever the council shall deem any special assessment invalid or defective for any reason whatever, or if any court of competent jurisdiction shall have adjudged such assessment to be illegal for any reason whatever, in whole or in part, the council shall have power to cause a new assessment to be used for the same purpose for which the former assessment was made, whether the improvement or any part thereof has been completed or not, and whether any part of the assessment has been collected or not. All proceedings on such reassessment and for the collection thereof shall be made in the same manner as provided for the original assessment. If any portion of the original assessment shall have been collected and not refunded, it shall be applied upon the reassessment and the reassessment shall to that extent be deemed satisfied. If more than the amount reassessed shall have been collected, the balance shall be refunded to the person making such payment. 
Sec. 12.23. - Additional procedures. 
    In any case where the provisions of this chapter may prove to be insufficient to carry into full effect the making of any special assessment, the council shall provide by ordinance any additional steps or procedures required to effect the improvement by special assessment.

(1)  Be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; 
(2)  Make governmental decisions and policy in the proper governmental channels; 
(3)  Not use public office for personal gain. 
    To enhance public trust, the city must provide its officers and employees with adequate guidelines for separating their roles as private citizens from their roles as public servants. 
    This Code sets minimum standards of ethical conduct for all city officers and employees, elected or appointed, paid or unpaid. It proscribes actions incompatible with the public interest and directs disclosure of private financial or other interests in matters affecting the city. It is intended to supplement and not replace applicable statutes regarding conflicts of interest. 
(b)  Responsibilities of public office. City officers and employees are bound to uphold the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the state and to comply with and carry out impartially the laws of the nation, the state, and the Charter and Code of Ordinances of the city. City officers and employees must not exceed their authority or breach the law or ask others to do so. City officers and employees are bound to observe in their official acts the highest standards of ethics and to discharge the duties of their offices faithfully, regardless of personal consideration, recognizing that their conduct in both their official and private affairs should be above reproach. 
    All city officers and employees shall safeguard public confidence by being honest, fair and respectful of all persons and property with whom they have contact, by maintaining non-partisanship in all official acts, and by avoiding conduct which may tend to undermine respect for city officers and employees and for the city as an institution. 
    City officers shall support the maintenance of a positive and constructive work place environment for city employees and for citizens and businesses dealing with the city. City officers shall recognize their special role in dealings with city employees to in no way create the perception of inappropriate direction to staff. 
    The professional and personal conduct of city officers must be above reproach and avoid even the appearance of impropriety. City officers shall strive to refrain from abusive conduct, personal charges or verbal attacks upon the character or motives of other members of city council, boards and/or commissions, the staff or public. 
    City officers shall prepare themselves for public issues, listen courteously and attentively to all public discussions before the body; and focus on the business at hand. They shall refrain from interrupting other speakers; making personal comments not germane to the business of the body; or otherwise interfering with the orderly conduct of meetings. 
    City officers shall represent the official policies or positions of the city council, boards and/or commissions to the best of their ability when designated as delegates for this purpose. When presenting their individual opinions and positions, city officers shall explicitly state they do not represent their body or the city, nor will they allow the inference that they do.

ARTICLE VI. - CONSULTANT COSTS 

Sec. 2-280. - Purpose. 
    The city council members find that applications for zoning amendments, planned unit developments, special land uses, site plan review, and various other authorizations, permissions, permits, reviews, inspections, selections, services, or approvals, sometimes present special complexities, burdens, or a need for technical expertise such that it is reasonable and appropriate for the city to seek consultation, advice, engineering, legal review, inspection, and assistance from one or more consultants. The city and its boards and commissions should not have to depend solely on information, findings and opinions produced by consultants or persons who work for the applicant or for other parties or agencies. 
    The city further finds that in such circumstances, it appropriate for the applicant, rather than the city and its taxpayers, to bear the cost of engaging such consultants for the city when the need for and benefit of these consulting services is primarily created by and for the applicant. 
    Therefore, it is the city's policy that all such consulting costs incurred by the city should be charged to and paid by the applicant. 
(Ord. No. O-01-18, § 1, 3-5-2018) 
Sec. 2-281. - Review expenses charged to applicant. 
    In circumstances where an applicant requests the city for an authorization, permission, permit, review, inspection, selection, service, or approval for which the city deems it is necessary or appropriate to engage one or more consultants to advise and assist the city, the applicant shall be charged and required to pay the city's cost of the consultant(s). 
(Ord. No. O-01-18, § 1, 3-5-2018) 
Sec. 2-282. - Escrow deposit; documentation of payments from escrow; additional funds; payment in full prior to final approval; refund of surplus. 
    The city may require the applicant to deposit funds in advance to be held by the city in an escrow account in an amount estimated by the city to cover the city's anticipated consultant costs. The city shall draw down from the escrow account to pay its consultant(s). Payments from escrow shall be documented by a written billing or accounting for the consulting work performed and the cost, and such written documentation may be examined by the applicant. If the city later determines its consulting expenses may exceed the amount in escrow, the city may require the applicant to deposit additional amounts. Final approval shall not be issued until the applicant has paid in full the city's consultant costs. Any surplus funds shall be refunded by the city to the applicant or other person who deposited the funds.

ARTICLE XI. - VACANT AND NEGLECTED PROPERTIES[10] 

Footnotes: 
--- (10) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. O-4-11, § 1, adopted Nov. 21, 2011, amended Art. XI in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. XI, §§ 26-321-26-334, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. No. O-01-10, § 1, 3-1-2010. 

Sec. 26-321. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to help protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens by preventing blight, protecting property values and neighborhood integrity, avoiding the creation and maintenance of nuisances and ensuring safe and sanitary maintenance of dwellings, commercial and industrial buildings. Due to economic conditions, mortgage fraud, and increased bankruptcies, many homes and buildings have become vacant and unsupervised. This has caused properties to become attractive nuisances for minors and criminal activity. Vacant properties have a negative impact on surrounding properties and neighborhoods. Potential buyers are deterred by the presence of nearby vacant abandoned buildings. There is an increased instance of unsecured or open doors and windows, broken water pipes, theft of metals and other materials, overgrowth of grass, weeds, shrubs, and bushes, illegal dumping, and rat and vermin activity at vacant structures. Such neglect devalues properties and causes deterioration in neighborhoods and commercial areas. The city also needs to be able to contact owners for fire safety and police reasons. 
(Ord. No. O-04-11, § 1, 11-21-2011) 
Sec. 26-322. - Scope. 
    The provisions of this article shall apply to all existing residential, commercial and industrial structures and all vacant land. 
(Ord. No. O-04-11, § 1, 11-21-2011) 
Sec. 26-323. - Definition of vacant property. 
    A vacant property is defined as a building or structure that is not legally or currently occupied. Evidence of vacancy shall include any condition that on its own, or combined with other conditions present, would lead a reasonable person to believe that the property is vacant. Such conditions include, but are not limited to: overgrown and/or dead vegetation; accumulation of newspapers, circulars, flyers and/or mail; past-due utility notices and/or disconnected utilities; accumulation of trash, junk and/or debris; boarded-up windows; abandoned vehicles, auto parts or materials; the absence of window coverings such as curtains, blinds and/or shutters; the absence of furnishings and/or personal items consistent with habitation or occupancy; statements by neighbors, passersby, delivery agents, or government employees that the property is vacant. 
(Ord. No. O-04-11, § 1, 11-21-2011) 
Sec. 26-324. - Registry of vacant properties.

If certified mail/return receipt requested is sent to the address and the mail is returned marked "refused" or "unclaimed," or if ordinary mail sent to the address is returned for whatever reason, then such occurrence shall be prima facie proof that the owner has failed to comply with this requirement. 
(3)  The name of the individual responsible for the care and control of the property. Such individual may be the owner, if the owner is an individual, or may be someone other than the owner with whom he/she has contracted. 
(4)  A current address, phone number, fax, and email address (if fax and email addresses are available) where communications may be sent that will be acknowledged as received by the individual responsible for the care and control of the property. If certified mail/return receipt requested is sent to the address and the mail is returned marked "refused" or "unclaimed," or if ordinary mail sent to the address is returned for whatever reason, then such occurrence shall be prima facie proof that the owner has failed to comply with this requirement. 
(Ord. No. O-04-11, § 1, 11-21-2011) 
Sec. 26-327. - Fee. 
    At the time of registration, the owner shall pay a registration and inspection fee which shall be established by resolution of the city council. In addition, in the case where the owner has failed to register, there shall be assessed the added costs of the city's expenses in having to determine ownership which may include, but are not limited to, title searches.

Sec. 82-411. - Purchase, consumption, or possession by minors. 
(a)  Fines and sanctions. A minor shall not purchase or attempt to purchase alcoholic liquor, consume or attempt to consume alcoholic liquor, or possess or attempt to possess alcoholic liquor, or have any bodily alcohol content, except as provided in this section. A minor who violates this subsection is responsible for a municipal civil infraction or guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by the following fines and sanctions: 
(1)  For the first violation, the minor is responsible for a civil infraction and shall be fined not more than $100.00. A court may order the minor to participate in substance use disorder services as defined in section 6230 of the Public Health Code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.6230, and designated by the Administrator of the State Office of Substance Abuse Services, and may order the minor to perform community service and to undergo substance abuse screening and assessment at the individual's own expense. 
(2)  For a violation of this subsection that occurs after one prior judgment, the minor is guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment for not more than 30 days if the court finds that the minor violated an order of probation, failed to successfully complete any treatment, screening, or community service ordered by the court, or failed to pay any fine for that conviction or juvenile adjudication, or by a fine of not more than $200.00, or both. A court may order the minor to participate in substance use disorder services as defined in section 6230 of the Public Health Code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.6230, and designated by the Administrator of the State Office of Substance Abuse Services, to perform community service, and to undergo substance abuse screening and assessment at the individual's own expense. 
(3)  For a violation of this subsection that occurs after two or more prior judgments, the minor is guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment for not more than 60 days, if the court finds that the minor violated an order of probation, failed to successfully complete any treatment, screening, or community service ordered by the court, or failed to pay any fine for that conviction or juvenile adjudication, or by a fine of not more than $500.00, or both, as applicable. A court may order the minor to participate in substance use disorder services as defined in section 6230 of the Public Health Code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.6230, and designated by the Administrator of the State Office of Substance Abuse Services, to perform community service, and to undergo substance abuse screening and assessment at the individual's own expense. 
(b)  Fraudulent identification. An individual who furnishes fraudulent identification to a minor or, notwithstanding subsection (a), a minor who uses fraudulent identification to purchase alcoholic liquor, is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 93 days or a fine of not more than $100.00, or both. 
(c)  Probation and deferral. If an individual who pleads guilty to a misdemeanor violation of subsection (a)(2) or offers a plea of admission in a juvenile delinquency proceeding for a misdemeanor violation of subsection (a)(2), the court, without entering a judgment of guilt in a criminal proceeding or a determination in a juvenile delinquency proceeding that the juvenile has committed the offense and with the consent of the accused, may defer further proceedings and place the individual on probation. The terms and conditions of that probation include, but are not limited to, the sanctions set forth in subsection (a)(3), payment of the costs including minimum state cost as provided for in section 18m of chapter XIIA of the Probate Code of 1939, 1939 PA 288, MCL 712A.18m, and section 1j of chapter IX of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1927 PA 175, MCL 769.1j, and the costs of probation as prescribed in section 3 of chapter XI of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1927 PA 175, MCL 771.3. If a court finds that an individual violated a term or condition of probation or that the individual is utilizing this subsection in another court, the court may enter an adjudication of guilt, or a determination in a juvenile delinquency proceeding that the individual has committed the offense, and proceed as otherwise provided by law. If an individual fulfills the terms and conditions of probation, the court shall discharge the individual and dismiss the proceedings. A discharge and dismissal under this section is without adjudication of guilt or without a determination in a juvenile delinquency proceeding that the individual has committed the offense and is not a conviction or juvenile adjudication for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law on conviction of a crime. An individual may obtain only one discharge and dismissal under this subsection. The court shall maintain a nonpublic record of the matter while proceedings are deferred and the individual is on probation and if there is a discharge and dismissal under this subsection. The Secretary of State shall retain a nonpublic record of a plea and of the discharge and dismissal under this subsection. These records shall be furnished to any of the following: 
(1)  To a court, prosecutor, or police agency on request for the purpose of determining if an individual has already utilized this subsection. 
(2)  To the department of corrections, a prosecutor, or a law enforcement agency, on the department's, a prosecutor's, or a law enforcement agency's request, subject to all of the following conditions: 
a.  At the time of the request, the individual is an employee of the department of corrections, the prosecutor, or the law enforcement agency, or an applicant for employment with the department of corrections, the prosecutor, or the law enforcement agency. 
b.  The record is used by the department of corrections, the prosecutor, or the law enforcement agency only to determine whether an employee has violated his or her conditions of employment or whether an applicant meets criteria for employment. 
(d)  Deferred violation-prior to judgment. A misdemeanor violation of subsection (a) successfully deferred, discharged, and dismissed under subsection (c) is considered a prior judgment for the purposes of subsection (a)(3). 
(e)  Court-ordered screening. A court may order an individual found responsible for or convicted of violating subsection (a) to undergo screening and assessment by a person or agency as designated by the department-designated community mental health entity as defined in section 100a of the Mental Health Code, 1974 PA 258, MCL 330.1100a, to determine whether the individual is likely to benefit from rehabilitative services, including alcohol or drug education and alcohol or drug treatment programs. A court may order an individual subject to a misdemeanor conviction or juvenile adjudication of, or placed on probation regarding, a violation of subsection (a) to submit to a random or regular preliminary chemical breath analysis. The parent, guardian, or custodian of a minor who is less than 18 years of age and not emancipated under 1968 PA 293, MCL 722.1 to 722.6, may request a random or regular preliminary chemical breath analysis as part of the probation. 
(f)  Notification of parent or guardian. A law enforcement officer, on determining that an individual who is less than 18 years of age and not emancipated under 1968 PA 293, MCL 722.1 to 722.6, allegedly consumed, possessed, or purchased alcoholic liquor, attempted to consume, possess, or purchase alcoholic liquor, or had any bodily alcohol content in violation of subsection (a) shall notify the parent or parents, custodian, or guardian of the individual as to the nature of the violation if the name of a parent, guardian, or custodian is reasonably ascertainable by the law enforcement agency.

The law enforcement officer may notify the parent, guardian, or custodian by any means reasonably calculated to give prompt actual notice including, but not limited to, notice in person, by telephone, or by first-class mail. If an individual less than 17 years of age is incarcerated for violating subsection (a), his or her parents or legal guardian shall be notified immediately as provided in this subsection. 
(g)  Possession of alcohol in course of employment. This section does not prohibit a minor from possessing alcoholic liquor during regular working hours and in the course of his or her employment if employed by a person licensed by the Michigan Liquor Control Code of 1998 (MCL 436.1101 et seq.), by the State Liquor Control Commission, or by an agent of the commission, if the alcoholic liquor is not possessed for his or her personal consumption.

ARTICLE VI. - COMPLETE STREETS 

Sec. 106-300. - Findings and purpose. 
    The city council finds that "complete streets," as defined in this article, are a design framework to enable safe and convenient access for all legal users of public streets, including pedestrians, bicyclists, transit riders, and motorists of all ages and abilities. Complete streets are achieved when transportation agencies routinely plan, design, construct, reconstruct, operate, and maintain the transportation network to improve travel conditions for bicyclists, pedestrians, transit, motorists, and freight in a manner consistent with, and supportive of, the surrounding community. Development of pedestrian, bicycle, and transit infrastructure offers long-term cost savings and opportunities to create safe and convenient non-motorized travel. Streets that support and invite multiple uses, including safe, active, and ample space for pedestrians, bicycles, and transit are more conducive to the public life and efficient movement of people than streets designed primarily to move automobiles. Increasing active transportation (e.g., walking, bicycling and use public transportation) offers the potential for improved public health, economic development, a cleaner environment, reduced transportation costs, enhanced community connections, social equity, and more livable communities. The City of Berkley's Master Plan, adopted in January 2007, and amended from time to time, addresses multiple forms of transportation including roads, mass transportation, and non-motorized transportation. Principles have been and continue to be adopted nationwide at state, county, MPO, and city levels in the interest of proactive planning and adherence to federal regulation that guide transportation planning organizations to promote multi-modal transportation options and accessibility for all users. In response to the Complete Streets initiative, the Michigan Legislature enacted an amendment to the Michigan Planning Enabling Act, in 2010 stating that a community's master plan shall include all components of a transportation system and their interconnectivity including streets and bridges, public transit, bicycle facilities, pedestrian ways, freight facilities and routes, port facilities, railroad facilities, and airports, to provide for the safe and efficient movement of people and goods in a manner that is appropriate to the context of the community and, as applicable, considers all legal users of the public right-of-way. 
    Therefore, in order to improve the safety and efficiency of the city's transportation system and to promote the health and economic opportunities of residents and visitors, the city, through this article, establishes it to be the policy of the city to encourage complete streets. 
(Ord. No. O-02-18, § 1, 3-5-2018) 
Sec. 106-301. - Definition. 
    Complete streets means, for purposes of this article, streets that are designed to enable safe and convenient access for all legal users of public streets, including pedestrians, bicyclists, transit riders, and motorists of all ages and abilities. 
(Ord. No. O-02-18, § 1, 3-5-2018) 
Sec. 106-302. - Policy established. 
    It shall be the policy of the city to encourage complete streets, and to implement this policy as follows: 
(1)  The city planning commission shall create a non-motorized transportation network plan as part of the master plan update. This plan shall be created and approved by the city planning commission, in consultation with community development services department, the department of public works, the parks and recreation department, the downtown development authority and the city council. 
(2)  The non-motorized transportation network plan shall include, at a minimum, accommodations for accessibility, sidewalks, curb ramps and cuts, trains and pathways, signage and bike lanes and shall incorporate principles of complete streets and maximize walkable and bikeable streets within the city. 
(3)  After initial adoption, the non-motorized transportation network plan shall be updated regularly as part of the city master plan update process. 
(4)  Until the planning commission adopts the initial non-motorized transportation network plan, the planning commission shall review all street plans prior to the adoption of the non-motorized plan, and all public street projects or public street reconstruction projects in the city shall be designed to safely accommodate all legal users of the public right-of-way, including pedestrians, people requiring mobility aids, bicyclists and drivers and passengers of transit vehicles, trucks, automobiles and motorcycles with the following exceptions: 
a.  Bicycle and pedestrian facilities are not required where they are prohibited by law. 
b.  Public transit facilities are not required on streets not serving as transit routes. 
c.  Encouraging walking, biking, or transit would be contrary to public health and safety, 
d.  The cost would be excessively disproportionate to the need or potential use, 
e.  The cost would result in an unacceptable diminishing of other city services, 
f.  The project segment length would not result in a meaningful addition to the non-motorized network, 
g.  There is no identified long-term need, and/or 
h.  The public works project in question is due to an emergency that requires near-term action. 
(5)  After initial adoption of the non-motorized transportation network plan, all public street projects or public street reconstruction projects in the city shall be in conformity with the non-motorized transportation network plan, subject to the exceptions in subsection (4), above.

Sec. 118-156. - Landlord and tenant relationship. 
(a)  The city hereby declares that this article has, as one of its principal objectives, the lawful public purpose of rapidly developing and maximizing the educational, community service, cultural and public safety potential of cable television in order to benefit all of the residents of the city. The city further finds that the public interest and necessity require that no owner of any multiple-unit residential dwelling (nor his agent or representative) be permitted to directly or indirectly prevent any resident of such dwelling from receiving cable communications service installation, maintenance and services from a grantee operating under a valid franchise issued by the city. 
(b)  In order to provide the opportunity for the residents of any multiple-unit residential dwelling to obtain service from a grantee, such grantee may negotiate an agreement with the owner of that dwelling or, failing agreement, may request that the city exercise its power of eminent domain for the necessary public purpose of enabling the grantee to serve residents of that multiple-unit residential dwelling. Upon request of such grantee, the city may commence condemnation proceedings in accordance with applicable law. In the event of such proceeding, in preparing its good faith offer of just compensation, the city may consider: 
(1)  The amount and fair market value of space occupied by the grantee's cable and related facilities. The fair market value of the space shall be assessed in light of the prior use, if any, of that space, together with any evidence of nonspeculative alternative uses. 
(2)  The present value of any funds that the owner will reasonably expend over time in ensuring that the grantee conforms to all laws, regulations and the reasonable conditions necessary to ensure the safety, convenient functioning and appearance of the multiple-unit residential dwelling. 
(3)  The continued physical availability of other space on the premises for the installation of alternative modes of television program reception or delivery. 
(4)  As an offset to the amounts set forth in subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, any increase in the fair market value of the multiple-unit residential dwelling attributable to the availability of the grantee's service to the property's tenants. 
(5)  Any other reasonable, nonspeculative factors which the city may find relevant. 
The requesting grantee shall indemnify the city for all expenses and costs incurred by the city in the condemnation proceedings as well as for the full amount of the condemnation award made to the owner if such condemnation proceedings are completed. 
(c)  Notwithstanding any other language in this section or elsewhere in this article, the grantee shall not be obligated to provide service to any multiple-unit residential dwelling so long as the owner of that dwelling demands compensation from the grantee in an amount that is unreasonable or imposes financial or other conditions that would, in the grantee's reasonable business judgment, render provision of service to that dwelling uneconomic. The grantee shall not be obligated, in such circumstances, to request the city to institute condemnation proceedings. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this article or the franchise agreement, a grantee shall be permitted to charge each resident of a multiple-unit residential dwelling an additional charge, above and beyond the service rate for a single-family dwelling, as specified in the franchise agreement, solely to defray the exact additional per resident cost to the grantee of compensating the owner for access to the multiple-unit residential dwelling. Any such additional charge shall be subject to the approval of city. Such additional charge shall not be included in the computation of the franchise fees due to the city pursuant to this article or the franchise agreement. 
(d)  Neither the owner of any multiple-unit residential dwelling nor his agent or representative shall penalize, charge or surcharge a tenant or resident, or forfeit or threaten to forfeit any right of such tenant or resident, or discriminate in any way against such tenant or resident who requests or receives cable communications service from a company operating under a valid and existing cable communication franchise issued by the city. Any person convicted of violating any provision of this section is subject to a fine of not more than $300.00 for each offense. 
(e)  No person shall resell, without the express written consent of both the grantee and the city, any cable service, program or signal transmitted by a grantee operating under a franchise issued by the city. 
(f)  Nothing in this section shall prohibit a person from requiring that cable communications system facilities conform to laws and regulations and reasonable conditions necessary to protect safety, functioning and appearance. 
(g)  Nothing in this division shall prohibit a person from requiring a grantee from agreeing to indemnify the owner, or his agents or representatives, for damages or for liability for physical damages caused by installation, operation, maintenance or removal of cable television facilities.

The grantee shall maintain a local office or offices which provide the necessary facilities, equipment and personnel to comply, under normal operating conditions, with the customer service standards set forth in subsections (a)(1)-(a)(5) of this section. For purposes of this section, the term "normal operating conditions" embrace all conditions which are within the control of the grantee, including special promotions, pay-per-view events, rate increases and maintenance or upgrade of the cable system, but excluding conditions outside the grantee's control, such as natural disasters, civil disturbances, power outages, telephone network outages and extreme weather: 
(1)  On a monthly basis, provide sufficient customer service representatives and toll-free telephone line capacity during normal business hours to ensure that a minimum of 90 percent of all calls will be answered within 30 seconds and 90 percent of all calls for service will not be required to wait more than 30 seconds after such call has been answered before being connected to a service representative. All incoming customer service lines shall not be simultaneously busy more than three percent of the total time the cable office is open on any business day. 
(2)  Staffed emergency toll-free telephone line capacity on a 24-hour basis, including weekends and holidays. 
(3)  Maintenance of an office in the franchise area of the authority with adequate office hours to meet public demand. The authority may require the grantee to alter or extend these hours if there is significant evidence through subscriber complaints that the posted hours are not adequate. 
(4)  An emergency system maintenance and repair staff, capable of responding to and repairing system malfunctions on a 24-hour basis. 
(5)  An installation staff, capable of furnishing standard installation to any subscriber within seven days after receipt of a request. The term "standard installations" shall mean those located up to 150 feet from where trunk and feeder cable have been activated. The grantee shall, at its sole expense, cause all drops required to be buried, to be buried within 15 days of installation of service, unless conditions during such period make burial impracticable, in which case the drop shall be buried within 15 days after physical conditions reasonably allow for such burial. In the event of any dispute between the grantee and the subscriber as to when conditions permit burial of the drop, such dispute shall be resolved by the decision of the city's building official or other official designated by the city to resolve such disputes. 
(6)  The grantee shall provide written instructions and information at the time of installation and reinstallation, and at least annually thereafter, to all subscribers on products and services, prices and options, installation and service maintenance policies, instructions for using the system, and billing and complaint procedures. Such instructions and information shall include the grantee's business address, applicable phone number, and the name of the appropriate official or department of the grantee to whose attention the subscriber should direct a request for service, request for billing adjustment or complaint. Such instructions and information shall also include the name, business address and telephone number of the authority's executive director and the title, business address and telephone number of the designated city employee to whom the subscriber can call or write for information regarding the terms, conditions and provisions governing the grantee's franchise if the grantee fails to respond within a reasonable period of time to the subscriber's complaint or request for installation, service or billing adjustment. The grantee shall promptly furnish revised written instructions and information to each subscriber whenever the instructions and information previously provided have been materially changed. The written instructions and information provided for in this section shall be subject to the review and approval of the authority which shall not withhold its approval unreasonably. 
(b)  Local office. For purposes of this section, the offices which the grantee is required to maintain may be a virtual office consisting of a toll-free telephone number which all subscribers in the city may access from their homes 24 hours a day, seven days a week to register complaints or questions concerning the cable system, conveniently located bill payment offices within the combined corporate limits of the Cities of Royal Oak, Ferndale, Clawson, Pleasant Ridge, Berkley and Huntington Woods where subscribers may pay their bills at no charge for delivery and pickup of converter boxes, remotes and similar grantee-provided customer premises equipment. 
(c)  Authority. Unless otherwise specified by the city, the term "authority" as used in this section shall mean: 
(1)  The Intergovernmental Cable Communications Authority (ICCA) for a grantee where the city has transferred or delegated certain powers, functions, duties and responsibilities on cable television matters for that grantee to the ICCA; and 
(2)  The Southeast Oakland County Cable Communications Cooperative (SOCCC) for a grantee where the city has transferred or delegated certain powers, functions, duties and responsibilities on cable television matters for that grantee to the SOCCC. 
(Ord. No. O-18-97, § 6.5-130, 7-21-1997) 
Sec. 118-172. - Cable service. 
(a)  The grantee shall interrupt system service only with good cause and for the shortest time possible and, except in emergency situations, only after periodic cable casting notice of service interruption for two days prior to the anticipated interruption. Services may be interrupted between 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. for routine testing, maintenance and repair, without notification, any night except Friday, Saturday, Sunday, holidays or the night preceding a holiday. 
(b)  The grantee shall maintain a written log, or an equivalent stored in computer memory and capable of access and reproduction in printed forms, of all subscriber service complaints. Such log shall list the date and time of such complaints, identifying the subscribers and describing the nature of the complaints and when and what actions were taken by the grantee in response thereto. Such log shall be kept at the grantee's local office or otherwise shall promptly be made available by the grantee to the municipality, reflecting the operations to date for a period of at least three years, and shall be available for public inspection during regular business hours. The grantee shall submit a summary of such complaints quarterly to the authority for its review or a copy thereof if the authority so requests. For purposes of this subsection, the local office which the grantee is required to maintain may be the virtual office described in section 118-171; provided, however, that, upon request, the grantee shall make available for public inspection at a location in or proximate to the city the log required to be maintained by the grantee pursuant to this subsection. 
(c)  For purposes of this section, the term "service interruption" shall mean any loss or material distortion of picture and/or sound on one or more channels; the term "subscriber problem" shall mean a service interruption affecting a single subscriber; the term "outage" shall mean a service interruption affecting two or more subscribers. Under normal operating conditions as specified in section 118-171, the grantee shall maintain a sufficient repair force of competent technicians so as to respond effectively to any subscriber problem or outage within the following time periods, unless the applicable period is extended at the request of the subscriber or extended pursuant to the requirements of any applicable law or regulation: 
(1)  Subscriber problem: Same day service, seven days a week for all requests for service received prior to 12:00 p.m. (noon) each day. In no event shall the response time for notice received after 12:00 p.m. (noon) exceed 24 hours, including weekends and holidays, from the time the grantee receives notice of the problem. 
(2)  Outage: Within two hours, including weekends and holidays, from the time the grantee discovers or receives notice of the outage. 
(d)  Upon receipt of a request for service, the grantee shall establish a four-hour appointment window with the subscriber (or adult representative of the subscriber). The grantee shall respond to the request for service within such established appointment window. If access to the subscriber's home is not made available to the grantee's technician, when the technician arrives during the established appointment window, the technician shall leave written notification stating the time of arrival and requesting that the grantee be contacted again to establish a new appointment window. In such case, the grantee shall respond in a timely manner after it is contacted to establish the new appointment window. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the grantee's technician telephones the subscriber's home before or during the appointment window and is advised that the technician will not be given access to the subscriber's home during the appointment window, then the technician shall not be obliged to travel to the subscriber's home or to leave the written notification referred to in this subsection, and the burden shall again be upon the subscriber (or adult representative of the subscriber) to contact the grantee to arrange for a new appointment window, in which case the grantee shall respond in a timely manner after it is contacted to establish the new appointment window. 
(e)  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) of this section, the grantee, under the provisions of this section and section 118-171, shall be deemed to have responded to a request for service, a subscriber problem, or an outage only when sufficient technicians arrive at the service location, begin work on the request for service or remedial work, as the case may be, and proceed diligently to complete such work. 
(f)  As to company owned and maintained equipment, no charge shall be made to the subscriber for any service call unless the problem giving rise to the service request can be demonstrated by the grantee to have been: 
(1)  Caused by subscriber negligence; 
(2)  Caused by malicious destruction of cable equipment; or 
(3)  A problem previously established as having been noncable in origin. 
(g)  All service personnel of the grantee or its contractors or subcontractors, who have as part of their normal duties contact with the general public, shall wear on their clothing a clearly visible identification card bearing their name and photograph. The grantee shall account for all identification cards at all times. Every service vehicle of the grantee shall be clearly identifiable by the public as such a vehicle. 
(Ord. No. O-18-97, § 6.5-131, 7-21-1997) 
Sec. 118-173. - Grantee's billing. 
(a)  The grantee's bills to its subscribers shall be clear, concise and understandable, and shall be itemized as to each charge reflected thereon. The bill and any accompanying communication from the grantee to its subscribers, and any other communication from the grantee to its subscribers, shall not contain any false or misleading statement. Such other communication referred to in this subsection shall be deemed to be a report under all applicable provisions of the franchise agreement relating to reports. 
(b)  The grantee shall file with the city a copy of the billing form to be used by grantee at least 32 days prior to sending any such billing form to subscribers, and the grantee shall make no changes in the latest billing form on file without similarly first filing the revised billing form with the city. 
(Ord. No. O-18-97, § 6.5-132, 7-21-1997) 
Sec. 118-174. - Disconnect and downgrade charges. 
(a)  The grantee shall make no charge to any subscriber on account of either complete discontinuance of service or net downgrade of service whereby the subscriber requests a lower tier of basic service and/or a net reduction in premium service. 
(b)  The grantee may only disconnect a subscriber if at least 45 days have elapsed after the due date for payment of the subscriber's bill and the grantee has provided at least ten days' written notice to the subscriber prior to disconnection specifying the effective date after which cable services are subject to disconnection; provided, however, notwithstanding the foregoing, the grantee may disconnect a subscriber at any time if the grantee in good faith and on reasonable grounds determines that the subscriber has tampered with or abused the grantee's equipment, or is or may be engaged in the theft of cable services. 
(c)  The grantee shall promptly disconnect any subscriber who so requests disconnection. No period of notice prior to requested termination of service may be required of subscribers by the grantee. If the subscriber fails to specify an effective date for disconnection, the effective date shall be deemed to be the day following the date the disconnect request is received by the grantee. No charge may be imposed upon the subscriber for any cable service delivered after the effective date of the disconnect request. 
(Ord. No. O-18-97, § 6.5-133, 7-21-1997) 
Sec. 118-175. - Late payment charges. 
    Late payment charges imposed by the grantee upon subscribers shall be fair and shall be reasonably related to the grantee's cost of administering delinquent accounts. No late payment charge shall be imposed upon a subscriber, and a subscriber shall not be deemed to be in arrears on a bill, unless at least 40 days have elapsed after the due date specified on the bill; and, for purposes of this section and section 118-174, the due date specified on the bill shall not be earlier than the first day of the monthly period to which the bill is attributable. 
(Ord. No. O-18-97, § 6.5-134, 7-21-1997) 
Sec. 118-176. - Notice of programming or channel change. 
    A grantee shall provide at least 45 days' written notice to subscribers (30 days if there is more than one grantee operating in city) prior to discontinuing any channel or programming service or to realigning any channel and shall provide written notice of the same to the authority no later than the grantee's notice to subscribers. This section shall not preclude the right of the city, or the authority on behalf of the city, to contest or prohibit any such action by the grantee if, and to the extent, such right exists. Such notice requirement shall not apply in cases in which a programming service is discontinued because a nonaffiliated provider thereof discontinues furnishing the same to the grantee on less than 45 days' notice (30 days if there is more than one grantee operating in city) to the grantee. In any such case the grantee shall nevertheless furnish notice to its subscribers and the authority promptly upon the grantee receiving notice of the discontinuance of the programming service from such unaffiliated provider. 
(Ord. No. O-18-97, § 6.5-135, 7-21-1997) 
Sec. 118-177. - Notice of price increase or reduction of service. 
    The grantee shall provide at least 45 days' written notice to subscribers (30 days if there is more than one grantee operating in city) prior to implementing any increase in subscriber rates or reduction in subscriber services, and shall provide written notice of the same to the authority no later than the grantee's notice to subscribers. The provisions of this section shall not preclude the right of the city, or the authority on behalf of the city, to contest or prohibit any such action by the grantee if, and to the extent, permitted by law. 
(Ord. No. O-18-97, § 6.5-136, 7-21-1997) 
Sec. 118-178. - Grantee's communications. 
    Prior to or simultaneously with any communication made by the grantee to the general public or to the grantee's subscribers announcing or explaining any increase in subscriber rates or reduction in programming services, the grantee shall furnish a copy of such communication to the authority. The copy of the communication required to be furnished to the authority under this article shall be deemed to be a report under all applicable provisions of the franchise agreement relating to reports, including, without limitation, the provisions of subsections (J) and (K) of section 19 of the franchise agreement in effect as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived. 
(Ord. No. O-18-97, § 6.5-137, 7-21-1997) 
Sec. 118-179. - Disclosure of information on grantee's costs. 
    If there is only one grantee franchised to provide cable communications service in the city, then if the grantee, in any communication to the general public, to the city, to subscribers or to the authority justifies a price increase or reduction in service on the basis of increased costs to which the grantee has been or will be subjected, then the grantee, on written request of the authority, shall promptly furnish the authority the underlying information on which such claim of increased costs is based in such form as the authority may request. The information so furnished by the grantee to the authority under this section shall also be deemed to be a report under all applicable provisions of the franchise agreement relating to reports, including, without limitation, the provisions of subsections (J) and (K) of section 19 of the franchise agreement in effect as of the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived. 
(Ord. No. O-18-97, § 6.5-138, 7-21-1997) 
Sec. 118-180. - Subscriber rebates. 
(a)  The grantee shall provide a customer with a full-day credit or a rebate for a service outage exceeding four hours in duration beyond the time that the customer notified the grantee of such outage. No credit or rebate shall be required where the outage was due to matters beyond the immediate control of the grantee, such as (by way of example and not limitation), service outages caused by storms or other natural disasters. In no event shall the customer incur a charge for any outage exceeding 48 hours. The credit specified herein shall be equal to 1/30 of the subscriber's total monthly bill for all services and equipment other than pay-per-view; provided, however, that if such monthly bill includes a charge for a pay-per-view program, subject to such outage or significant impairment, then the credit shall be increased by the amount of such charge. 
(b)  In the event of a violation of the provisions of this division by the grantee which results in a subscriber not receiving cable programming service or receiving only significantly impaired service, the authority, after notice to such grantee and an opportunity to be heard, may order and direct the grantee to issue a rebate to such subscriber in a reasonable amount determined by the authority to provide monetary relief to the subscriber substantially equal to the subscriber's unliquidated detriment or loss resulting from such violation, not to exceed the subscriber's monthly bill. 
(c)  Nothing in this section shall be deemed to preclude a subscriber from requesting and receiving from the grantee a rebate greater than that provided in subsections (a) and (b) of this section. 
(Ord. No. O-18-97, § 6.5-139, 7-21-1997) 
Sec. 118-181. - Security fund. 
(a)  Subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived, within ten days after the award of a new franchise, or the transfer, extension or renewal of an existing franchise, the grantee thereunder shall furnish the authority, on behalf of all of the authority's member communities, and thereafter maintain with the authority, throughout the term of the franchise, a cash deposit of $25,000.00 as security for: 
(1)  The faithful performance by it of all the provisions of this article and the franchise; 
(2)  Compliance with all orders, permits and directions of any agency, commission, board or department of the city having jurisdiction over its acts or defaults under the franchise; and 
(3)  The payment by the grantee of any claims, liens and taxes due the city which arise by reason of the construction, operation or maintenance of the system. 
(b)  Within ten days after notice to it that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the grantee shall pay to or deposit with the authority a sum of money in the full amount withdrawn. 
(c)  If the grantee fails to pay to the city any fees within the time fixed in this section; or fails, after ten days' written notice, to pay to the city any taxes due and unpaid; or fails to repay the city within such ten days, any damages, costs or expenses which the city shall be compelled to pay by reason of any act or default of the grantee in connection with a franchise; or fails, after three days' notice of such failure, to comply with any provisions of the franchise which the city reasonably determines can be remedied by a withdrawal from the security fund, the authority, on request of the city, may immediately withdraw the amount thereof, with interest and any additional charges, from the security fund. Upon such withdrawal, the authority shall notify the grantee of the amount and date thereof and shall remit to the city the amount so withdrawn. 
(d)  The security fund deposited pursuant to this section, including all interest thereon, if any, shall be held by the authority, for the benefit of its member communities, if the franchise is rescinded or revoked by reason of the default of the grantee. The grantee, however, shall be entitled to the return of such security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit at the expiration of the term of the franchise, provided that there is then no outstanding default on the part of the grantee. Any interest earned by the investment of the security fund shall become part of the security fund and unless consumed by the payment of liquidated damages, fees or other charges under this article, shall be returned to the grantee at the expiration of the franchise term, provided that there is then no outstanding default on the part of the grantee. 
(e)  The authority shall maintain the security fund in a segregated account and shall not commingle the security fund with any other monies of the authority. The authority may, but shall not be required to, invest the security fund so as to earn interest thereon and shall not be liable to the grantee on any claim based upon the lack or insufficiency of interest earned by such fund. 
(f)  Payment from the security fund shall not constitute a cure of any violation or any act of noncompliance by the grantee. The rights reserved to the city with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved by this article or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such security fund shall affect any other right the city may have. 
(g)  The security fund provided for in this section shall not be required if the franchise agreement expressly requires the grantee to provide a cash security fund, letter of credit or other form of security that is mutually agreeable to the city and the grantee. 
(Ord. No. O-18-97, § 6.5-140, 7-21-1997) 
Sec. 118-182. - Liquidated damages. 
(a)  The authority may assess liquidated damages of up to 100.00 per day against the grantee for each day the grantee is in violation of this division. Such assessment may be levied against the security fund specified in section 118-181 or any letter of credit, performance bond, or other security provided for in the franchise agreement. 
(b)  Assessment of liquidated damages shall not constitute a waiver by the city of any other right or remedy it may have under the franchise agreement or applicable law, including the right to recover from the grantee any costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, which are incurred by the city on account of the grantee's violation of this division. 
(Ord. No. O-18-97, § 6.5-141, 7-21-1997) 
Sec. 118-183. - Evaluation of violations. 
(a)  The violation of this article by the grantee, the grantee's agents, employees and/or independent contractors employed or retained by the grantee shall be grounds for evaluating: 
(1)  The grantee's compliance with any existing agreement and with applicable law; 
(2)  The quality of the grantee's service and whether it has been reasonable in light of community needs; 
(3)  The technical ability of the grantee to provide the services, facilities and equipment as set forth in an operator's proposal for future or renewed cable services; and 
(4)  The reasonableness of the grantee's proposal to meet the future cable-related community needs and interests of the residents and cable television consumers of the city. 
(b)  These evaluations shall be proper and germane for the city to consider formally when reviewing a proposal for renewal of any agreement to provide cable services within the city. 
(Ord. No. O-18-97, § 6.5-142, 7-21-1997) 
Sec. 118-184. - Remedies available. 
    If the authority determines that the grantee has violated this division, the authority may order appropriate rebates to subscribers as provided on section 118-180 and/or assess liquidated damages against the grantee as provided in section 118-182. In addition, the city may pursue any additional or other legal or equitable remedies available to it under the franchise agreement or any applicable law. 
(Ord. No. O-18-97, § 6.5-143, 7-21-1997) 
Sec. 118-185. - Appeal process. 
    With respect to matters affecting the city individually, and excluding matters affecting all of the authority's member communities equally, the grantee may appeal any action of the authority to the city by submitting a written appeal within 21 days from the date of the authority's action to which the grantee objects, including the proposed assessment of liquidated damages. Upon such appeal, the city council shall conduct a de novo review of the action of the authority being appealed and shall set a hearing date within 60 days of the date of receipt of the appeal. The grantee may present any information, data or other evidence to the city council either prior to or at the time of the hearing. Hearings shall be open to the public and members of the public, and representatives of the authority may also present any evidence or information pertinent to the matter appealed. The city council shall then determine whether to uphold, reverse or modify the action of the authority. The appeal shall stay any further action on the matter appealed until the appeal has been decided by the city council, including the assessment of liquidated damages.

Secs. 118-186-118-299. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS 
DIVISION 1. - GENERAL 

Sec. 118-300. - Short title. 
    This article shall be titled "Telecommunications Systems." 
(Ord. No. O-06-98, 12-7-98) 
Sec. 118-301. - Legislative purpose. 
    The City of Berkley has the authority to grant licenses and franchises for other telecommunication systems public or private line video, data or voice services using crossing a street, highway, rights-of-way or easements in the city. This article is intended to minimize the disruption of the streets, highways, rights-of-way and easements and to require those who seek to construct a telecommunication system to cooperate in the construction and the restoration of streets, highways, rights-of-way and easements of both overhead and underground lines. The city finds that it has too many unsightly overhead lines and poles in some sections of the city. They are proliferating, adversely affecting the public safety, detracting from property values and reaching maximum safe capacity of pole and underground spaces. The city further finds that public health, safety and welfare is better served by requiring installation of new utility lines and wires in underground conduit wherever practical. 
(Ord. No. O-06-98, 12-7-98) 
Sec. 118-302. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to regulate the granting of licenses and franchises for telecommunication systems other than cable television systems. 
(Ord. No. O-06-98, 12-7-98) 
Sec. 118-303. - Definitions. 
    Unless the context specifically indicates otherwise the meaning of the terms used in this ordinance shall be as follows: 
    City means the City of Berkley, Michigan. 
    Franchise is a non-exclusive, limited authorization to transact local business for the construction, maintenance and operation of a telecommunication system in the city awarded by ordinance in the form of a contract and accepted by the grantee. 
    Grantee is any holder of a telecommunication system license or franchise granted pursuant to this article. 
    Gross revenue shall mean all receipts collected by the grantee for all telecommunication and related operations and services within the corporate limits of the city as well as any other revenue arising from operation or possession of this franchise regardless of where billed.

(9)  Recoveries of bad debts previously written off and revenues from the sale or assignment of bad debts. Unrecovered bad debts charged off after diligent, unsuccessful efforts to collect are excludable from gross revenues from telecommunication business. "Gross revenue" does not include revenue uncollected from customers (bad debts) and sale or lease of customer service equipment, taxes, interconnection fees paid by grantee to other telecommunications carriers, or other similar types of pass-through charges for which grantee merely acts as a collecting agent and derives no economic benefit. 
    License is a written agreement granted by resolution for a telecommunication system to use the rights-of-way easements, highway, streets, alleys, and other places in the city for wires, poles, pipes, conduits or other public utility facilities, but not to transact local business with another person.

(d)  Nothing in this article shall be construed as a waiver of any codes, ordinances or regulations of the city or the city's right to require grantee or persons utilizing the telecommunication service to secure appropriate permits or authorizations for such use. No fee or charge may be imposed upon a grantee for any such permit or authorization, other than the standard fees or charges generally applicable to all persons for such permits or authorizations.

Applicant shall notify grantee of existing overlapping territory. Proof that a copy of the application has been served upon the current grantee(s) shall be provided to the city. No application for overlapping territory shall be processed until proof of service has been furnished to the city. It is not the intent of this article to either require or prohibit over-building.

All limitations are based on samples collected over an operating period representative of an industrial user's discharge, and in accordance with 40 C.F.R. Part 136. 
a.  The limitation for Total PCB is Non-detect. Total PCB shall not be discharged at detectable levels, based upon U.S. EPA Method 608, and the quantification level shall not exceed 0.2 ugm/l, unless a higher level is appropriate because of demonstrated sample matrix interference. Where one or more samples indicate detectable levels of Total PCB, the user shall be required to demonstrate compliance. For purposes of this subsection, this demonstration may be made using analytical data showing that the Total PCB concentration is below the detection level, or submission of a BMP in accordance with this Code. 
b.  The limitation of Mercury (Hg) is Non-detect. Mercury (Hg) shall not be discharged at detectable levels, based upon U.S. EPA Method 245.1, and the quantification level shall not exceed 0.2 ugm/1, unless a higher level is appropriate because of demonstrated sample matrix interference. Where one or more samples indicate detectable levels of Mercury, the user shall be required to demonstrate compliance. For the purposes of this subsection, this demonstration may be made using analytical data showing that the mercury concentration is below the detection level, or submission of a BMP in accordance with this Code. 
All limitations are based on samples collected over an operating period representative of an industrial user's discharge, and in accordance 40 C.F.R. Part 136. 
(3)  Compliance period. Within 30 days of the effective date of this division, the department shall notify all industrial user's operating under an effective wastewater discharge permit of the requirement to submit a compliance report within 180 days after the effective date of this division. The compliance report shall demonstrate the user's compliance or non-compliance with these limitations, and, in the event of non-compliance, include the submission of a plan and schedule for achieving compliance with the stated limitation. In no event shall a compliance schedule exceed 18 months from the effective date of this division. An industrial user who does not demonstrate compliance may petition the department for a second extension as part of an administrative consent order. The department shall include appropriate monitoring, reporting, and penalties into an administrative consent order that relates to a second extension, and shall enter into such an agreement only upon a good-faith showing by the industrial user of the actions taken to achieve compliance with this provision. 
(c)  National categorical pretreatment standards. All users shall comply with the applicable national categorical pretreatment standards and requirements promulgated pursuant to the act as set forth in 40 C.F.R., subchapter N, Effluent Guidelines and Standards, which are hereby incorporated by reference and with all other applicable standards and requirements, provided, that where a more stringent standard or requirement is applicable pursuant to state law or regulation, or to this division, then the more stringent standard or requirement shall be controlling. Affected dischargers shall comply with applicable reporting requirements under 40 C.F.R. Part 403 and as established by the department. The national categorical pretreatment standards which have been promulgated as of the effective date of this section are delineated in appendix A. 
(1)  Intake water adjustment. Industrial users seeking adjustment of national categorical pretreatment standards to reflect the presence of pollutants in their intake water must comply with the requirements of 40 C.F.R. 403.15. Upon notification of approval by the department, the adjustment shall be applied by modifying the permit accordingly. Intake water adjustments are not effective until incorporated into an industrial user's permit. 
(2)  Modification of national categorical pretreatment standards. The department may apply to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or to the state department of environmental quality, whichever is appropriate, for authorization to grant removal credits in accordance with the requirements and procedures in 40 C.F.R. 403.7. Such authorization may be granted only when the POTW treatment plant can achieve consistent removal for each pollutant for which a removal credit is being sought, provided, that any limitation of such pollutant(s) in the NPDES permit neither are being exceeded nor pose the prospect of being exceeded as a result of the removal credit being granted. Where such authorization is given to the department, any industrial user desiring to obtain such credit shall make an application to the department, consistent with the provisions of 40 C.F.R. 403.7 and of this division. Any credits which may be granted under this section may be subject to modification or revocation as specified in 40 C.F.R. 403.7, or as determined by the department. A requisite to the granting of any removal credit may be that the industrial user pay a surcharge based upon the amounts of such pollutants removed by the POTW, such surcharge being based upon fees or rates which the board may establish and, when appropriate, revise from time to time. Permits shall reflect, or be modified to reflect, any credit granted pursuant to this section. 
(3)  New sources. Industrial users who meet the new sources criteria shall install, maintain in operating condition, and start-up all pollution control equipment required to meet applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge. Within the shortest feasible time and not to exceed 90 days, new sources must meet all applicable pretreatment standards. 
(4)  Concentration and mass limits. When limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the department may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users. Equivalent limitations shall be calculated in accordance with sections 40 C.F.R. 403.6(c)(3) and/or 40 C.F.R. 403.6(c)(4) and shall be deemed pretreatment standards for the purposes of 33 U.S.C. 1317(d) and of this division. Industrial users will be required to comply with the equivalent limitations in lieu of the promulgated categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived. 
(5)  Reporting requirements for industrial users upon effective date of categorical pretreatment standards-baseline report. Within 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment standard, or 180 days after the final administrative decision made upon a category determination submission under section 40 C.F.R. 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial users subject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging into or scheduled to discharge into the Detroit POTW shall submit to the department a report containing the information listed in 40 C.F.R. 403.12(b)(1-7). Where reports containing this information have already been submitted to the Director or regional administrator in compliance with the requirement of 40 C.F.R. 128.140(b), the industrial user will not be required to resubmit this information. At least 90 days before commencement of any discharge, each new source and any existing sources that become industrial users after the promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment standard shall submit to the department a report which contains the information listed in 40 C.F.R. 403.12(b)(1-5). In such report, new sources shall include information concerning the method of pretreatment the source intends to use to meet applicable pretreatment standards. New sources shall provide estimates of the information requested in 40 C.F.R. 403.12(b,)(4) and (5). 
(d)  Dilution prohibited. Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, no user shall increase the use of process water, or in any way dilute or attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in the national categorical pretreatment standards, or in any other pollutant specific limitation or requirement imposed by the city, the city of Detroit or by the state. 
(e)  Hauled in wastewater. Any waste material or wastewater which is hauled into or within the service region for discharge to the POTW is subject to the requirements of this division including, but not limited to, permits, inspection, monitoring and enforcement. Unloading liquid or solid waste from hauling vehicles, directly or indirectly, into the POTW, with or without the benefit of pretreatment, is prohibited unless the person proposing to unload such waste has applied for and received a permit from the department for unloading such waste in accordance with the board's rules pertaining thereto. The discharger shall be subject to applicable terms and conditions, surcharges, fees or rates as established by the board. Hauled in wastewater shall only be discharged at points designated by the POTW after authorization or approval issued pursuant to the general permit requirements specified in section 126-122 of this Code. The department may establish specific limitations for sludge from municipally owned or operated POTW treatment plants which are different than the specific limitations in this division. 
(f)  Centralized waste treatment. It is unlawful for a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility to discharge any industrial waste or wastewater into the POTW without a wastewater discharge permit from the department. Any authorization granted, or permit issued, by the department to a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility shall specify the type of wastewater for which treatment is provided, and discharge approval is sought, from the POTW. Unless such industrial waste or wastewater is determined by the Department to require further authorization, a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility that has submitted an application to, and received previous approval from, the department to discharge wastewater is not required to obtain further authorization from the department before discharging such wastewater. 
    An industrial user, that provides centralized waste treatment services and files an application for the treatment and discharge of such types of wastewater to the POTW, shall provide the following minimum information in support thereof: 
(1)  The general nature, source and process(es) generating the type of wastewater. Any wastewater, which is generated from those processes and is subject to national categorical pretreatment standards as delineated in appendix A, shall be so designated; 
(2)  The identity of the toxic pollutants known or suspected to be present in the wastewater; 
(3)  At least one sample report showing the results of an analysis for the EPA priority pollutants for each type of wastewater for which application is made in subsection (f)(1) of this section; 
(4)  A statement, that is certified by a professional engineer, which addresses the treatability and compatibility of the wastewater, received or collected by the facility's treatment process(es); 
(5)  The identity of the materials and/or pollutants whose transport or treatment are regulated by the EPA, by the state, or by any other governmental agency. Upon request, the centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility shall provide a copy of its permit and/or license to the department; and 
(6)  Other information requested by the department including, but not limited to, information required by this Code, or by rules adopted by the board. 
The discharge from a centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility will be deemed approved for those specific types of wastewater delineated in a permit and, upon issuance of such permit in accordance with the procedures contained in section 126-122 of this Code, will be deemed approved for discharge into the POTW. The centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility shall comply with all applicable provisions contained in section 126-122 of this Code regarding permits. In furtherance of its obligations as control authority, the department may include in the permit a requirement to report at selected intervals the information mandated in subsections (1)-(6) of this section. 
All users granted a permit under this section shall maintain records which, at a minimum, identify the source, volume, character, and constituents of the wastewater accepted for treatment and disposal. These records may be reviewed at any time by the department. 
(g)  Groundwater discharges. Unless authorization has been granted by the department, the discharge of any groundwater into the POTW is prohibited. 
    The department may authorize the discharge of groundwater resulting from maintenance and related activities of gas, steam, or electrical utilities through the use of general permits. Subject to appropriate reporting requirements, the general permit shall authorize discharge in accordance with the terms of the permit. Utilities shall comply with this provision within 180 days after its enactment. 
    If a person, who proposes to discharge groundwater resulting from purge, response activity, or UST projects, has applied for and received a permit from the department, the department may authorize the discharge of such wastewater. Permits shall be issued in accordance with the procedures contained in section 126-122 of this Code, or in accordance with any rules adopted by the board. 
(h)  The City of Berkley right of revision. The City of Detroit and the city reserve the right to establish rules or regulations adopted by the board, additional or more stringent limitations or requirements on discharges to the POTW. (These rules and regulations shall be adopted in accordance with the rule-making procedures section 2-111 of the 1997 Detroit City Charter.) Ninety days after adoption by the board, industrial users shall comply with such rules and regulations. 
(i)  Accidental discharges. 
(1)  Each industrial user, which does not currently have an approved spill prevention plan or slug control plan, shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by this division, and all significant industrial users shall submit to the department detailed plans which show facilities and operating procedures to be implemented to provide protection against such accidental discharges. Facilities and measures to prevent and abate accidental discharges shall be implemented, provided, and maintained at the owner's or industrial user's cost or expense. Unless the significant industrial user has an approved spill prevention or slug control plan, all existing significant industrial users shall complete and submit such a plan within 60 days of the effective date of this division (November 19, 1986). New significant industrial users shall submit such a plan prior to the time they commence discharging. 
For purposes of this section, the information provided shall include the approximate average and maximum quantities of such prohibited materials or substances kept on the premises in the form of raw materials, chemicals and/or waste therefrom and the containment capacity for each. Only substances that are in a form which could readily be carried into the POTW and constitute a concentration of five percent or greater in the raw material, chemical solution or waste material, are required to be reported. Volumes of less than 55 gallons, or the equivalent thereof, need not be reported unless lesser quantities could cause pass through or cause interference with the POTW. 
The industrial user shall promptly notify the department of any significant changes or modifications to the plan including, but not limited to, a change in the contact person, or substance inventory. 
(2)  At least once every two years, the department shall evaluate whether a significant industrial user needs a plan to control slug discharges, as defined by 40 C.F.R. 403.8(f)(2)(v). Unless otherwise provided, all significant users shall complete, implement, and submit such a plan within 30 days of notification by the department. 
(j)  Notification requirements. Unless a different notice is provided by this division or applicable law, within one hour of becoming aware of a discharge into the POTW which exceeds or does not conform with federal, state or city laws, rules, regulations or permit requirements, or which could cause problems to the POTW, or which has the potential to cause the industrial user to implement its plan prepared in accordance with subsection (1) of this section, the industrial user shall telephone the department at its control center and notify the department of the discharge. The notification shall include the name of the caller, the location and time of discharge, the type of wastewater, the estimated concentration of excessive or prohibited pollutants and estimated volume, and the measures taken, or being taken, to abate the discharge into the POTW. Within five calendar days after the discharge, the industrial user shall submit a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences and when required by the department, the industrial user's wastewater discharge permit may be modified to include additional measures to prevent such future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, cost of treatment, loss, damages or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other environmental impairment or any other damage to person or property. 
(k)  Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user's bulletin board, or other prominent place, advising employees whom to contact in the department in the event of an actual or excessive or prohibited discharge. 
(l)  Recovery of costs. Any user discharging in violation of any of the provisions of this division, which produces a deposit or obstruction, or causes damage to or impairs the department's POTW, or causes the department to violate its NPDES permit, shall be liable to the department for any expense, loss, damage, penalty or fine incurred by the department because of said violation or discharge. Prior to assessing such costs, the department shall notify the user of its determination that the user's discharge was the proximate cause of such damage, obstruction, impairment, or violation of the city's NPDES permit and the department's intent to assess such costs to the user. Any such notice shall include written documentation which substantiates the determination of proximate cause and a breakdown of cost estimates. Failure to pay the assessed costs shall constitute a violation of this division. Such charge shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any penalties or remedies provided under this division, or this Code, or other statutes and regulations, or at law or in equity. 
(m)  Hazardous waste notification. All industrial users, who discharge into the city of Berkley collection system, shall notify the department in writing of any discharge of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste as set forth in 40 C.F.R. Part 261. Such notification must comply with the requirements of 40 C.F.R. 403.12(p). 
(n)  Authorized representative. The authorized representative, as defined in this Code, may designate a duly authorized representative of the individual designated in section 126-119(a) where: 
(1)  The authorization is made in writing by the individual defined in section 126-119(a);

2.  The period of noncompliance including exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and 
3.  Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. 
(2)  In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof; 
(3)  The industrial user shall control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with this division upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails. 
(c)  Bypass. Bypasses are prohibited unless the bypass does not cause a violation of pretreatment standards or requirements, but only if it is for essential maintenance to ensure efficient operation of the treatment system. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of subsections (1) and (2) of this section. 
(1)  Notice of anticipated bypass. Industrial users anticipating a bypass shall submit notice to the department at least ten days in advance. 
(2)  Notice of unanticipated bypass. An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time the industrial user becomes or should have become aware of the bypass. A written submission shall be provided within five (5) days of the time the industrial user becomes or should have become aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass including exact dates and times, and if the bypass has not been corrected, the prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. 
(3)  Prohibition of bypass and enforcement. Bypass is prohibited, and the department may take enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 
a.  The bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 
b.  There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated waste, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and 
c.  The industrial user properly notified the department as described in subsection (c)(2) of this section. 
(4)  Bypass approval. Where it meets all conditions in subsection (c)(3) of this section, the department may approve an anticipated bypass. 
(d)  Where one or more of the measurements taken for any pollutant defined in section 126-120(b) of this Code during a six-month period exceed by any magnitude the daily maximum non-detect limit for the same parameter, the industrial user may develop and implement pollution prevention initiatives, or a BMP, as part of its response. The department may, as part of an administrative order, also require development of a BMP as a part of the department's enforcement response. Upon approval of the department, these pollution prevention initiative, or BMPs shall be made an enforceable part of the wastewater discharge permit. Industrial users shall provide, at six-month intervals, analytical results and certifications in support of its implementation of an approved pollution prevention initiative or BMPs. Upon demonstration of compliance, the industrial user may request to be relieved of this implementation requirement. 
(e)  Emergency suspensions and orders. The department may order suspension of the sewer or wastewater treatment service and/or a wastewater discharge permit where, in the opinion of the department, such suspension is necessary to stop any actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or significant hazard to the health or welfare of persons or to the environment, interferes or may interfere with the POTW, or causes or may cause the City of Detroit to violate any condition of its NPDES permit. Any person notified of a suspension of the sewer or wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater discharge permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event the department provides informal notification under this section, written confirmation and an order shall be provided within 24 hours. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with any suspension or revocation order, the department shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection or services, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or danger to any individual or the environment. In the event such steps are taken, the director shall notify the industrial user within 24 hours in writing of such action and order, and the specific recourse available. In any event, the department shall provide the industrial user with an opportunity for a hearing before the director, or his designated representative, within ten days of such action. The industrial user shall submit a detailed written statement to the department within 15 days of the occurrence describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence. Upon proof of elimination of the non-complying discharge, the department shall reinstate the wastewater discharge permit and/or the sewer or wastewater treatment service. 
(f)  Notice of violation. Except in the case of an actual or threatened discharge as specified in subsection (e) of this section, whenever the department has reason to believe that any industrial user has violated or is violating this division, the department shall serve a written notice stating the nature of the violation upon such industrial user. Where applicable, the department shall pursue appropriate escalating enforcement action as defined within its approved enforcement response plan. The failure of the department to issue a notice of violation shall not preclude the department from escalating its enforcement response. 
(g)  Administrative actions. Whenever the department has reasonable grounds to believe that a user is violating, or has violated, a provision of its wastewater discharge permit, or a pretreatment standard or requirement or any prohibition of this division, the department, may initiate appropriate administrative enforcement action, except in the case of emergency or flagrant violation, in order to compel the industrial user to eliminate or to remedy such violation as soon as possible. 
(1)  a.  Conferences. The department may order any person, who violates this division, to attend a conference wherein the department may endeavor to cause the user to eliminate or remedy the violation by establishing an enforceable compliance schedule. The notice of violation shall be served at least ten days before the scheduled conference and shall set forth the date, time, and place thereof. The conference shall be conducted by a representative of the department. The industrial user shall present a plan and schedule for achieving compliance with this division. Nothing contained herein shall require the department to accept or agree to any proposed plan or schedule, or to prevent the department from proceeding with a show cause hearing as set forth in subsection (2) of this section. If the attendees agree upon a compliance schedule, the user and the department's duly authorized representative may enter, by consent, into a compliance agreement or an administrative order setting forth the terms of such agreement. An industrial user must exhibit good faith and expeditious efforts to comply with this division and any procedures, requirements, and agreements hereunder. 
b.  Compliance schedules. The user and the department may agree upon a schedule which sets forth the terms and conditions, and time periods or schedules for completion of actions to remedy or to eliminate the causes of violation. These schedules may be developed as part of a compliance agreement, administrative consent order. Schedules developed under this subsection shall adhere to the following conditions: 
1.  The schedule shall contain increments of progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of upgraded or additional pretreatment facilities, or to the implementation of additional operation and maintenance procedures required for the industrial user to meet the applicable pretreatment requirements and standards including, but not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary plans, completing final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing construction, and completing construction; 
2.  No single increment referred to in subsection 1. of this section shall exceed nine months; 
3.  Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the industrial user shall submit a progress report to the department including, at a minimum, whether it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date which it expects to comply with this increment of progress, the reason(s) for delay, and the steps being taken by the industrial user to return to the established schedule; and 
4.  Any deviations from the compliance schedule may result in the industrial user being found in violation of this division. 
c.  Administrative orders. The department may order any industrial user, who violates or continues to violate this division or a duly issued permit, to install and to properly operate devices, treatment facilities, or other related appurtenances. In addition, orders may contain such other requirements as might reasonably be necessary and appropriate to address the violation including the installation of pretreatment technology, additional self-monitoring and management practices, implementation of a waste minimization assessment to identify and implement feasible source reduction, and recycling practices to reduce the generation or release of pollutants at the facility. An order may be either an administrative consent order, which is the result of an agreement, or a unilateral administrative order. 
(2)  Show cause hearing. The department may order any industrial user, who violates this division or allows such violation to occur, to show cause before the department why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. A notice shall be served upon the industrial user specifying the time and place of a hearing before the department regarding the violation, the reason(s) why the action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and directing the industrial user to show cause before the department why any proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally, or by registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, at least ten days before the hearing. Service may be made upon any agent or officer of a corporation, or its authorized representative. 
a.  Hearing proceeding. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures adopted by the board. A hearings officer shall conduct the show cause hearing and take the evidence, and may: 
1.  In the name of the board, issue notices of hearing requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearing; 
2.  Transmit a report of the evidence and hearing, including transcripts and other evidence, together with recommendations to the director for action thereon.

h.  A finding the user has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation either of this division or of a duly issued permit did not occur. 
(4)  Public notification of significant noncompliance. The department shall publish in the largest daily newspaper published in the City of Detroit and the city a list of all industrial users which were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment requirements at any time during the previous 12 months. All industrial users identified in a proposed publication shall be provided with a copy of the proposed notice at least 30 days before publication and allowed an opportunity to comment as to its accuracy. 
(h)  Legal actions. 
(1)  Criminal action. Any user, who violates any provision of this division including the failure to pay any fees, fines, charges or surcharges imposed hereby, or any condition or limitation of a permit issued pursuant thereto, or who knowingly makes any false statements, representations or certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this division or wastewater discharge permit, or who tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device required under this division, is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine not to exceed five $500.00 for each violation per day, or by imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or by both. The department is hereby authorized, through its counsel, to seek prosecution of criminal charges against any person violating any provision of this division. 
(2)  Civil action. Whenever the department has reasonable grounds to believe that a user is violating, or has violated, a provision of its wastewater discharge permit, a pretreatment standard or requirement or any requirement of this division, the director may commence a civil action to compel compliance in a court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin the user from discharging, and/or to obtain appropriate relief to remedy the violations. The department or board may also seek additional legal and/or equitable relief. The commencement of suit neither constitutes an exclusive election of remedies nor prohibits the department, director, board, or City of Detroit from commencing action in federal court for discharges believed to be in violation of this division, state and federal requirements contained in the Clean Water Act, the City of Detroit's NPDES permit, or other applicable laws or requirements. In addition, the City of Detroit may recover the reasonable attorney fees, court costs, court reporters' fees, and other unusual expenses related to enforcement activities or litigation against the person found to have violated this division, or the orders, rules, regulations and permits issued hereunder. 
(3)  All fines, costs, and penalties which are imposed by any court of competent jurisdiction shall be payable to the City of Detroit water and sewerage department.

Sec. 126-141. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Premises: Each lot or parcel of land, building or premises having any connection to the water distribution system of the city, or the sewage disposal system of the city. 
    User: Each lot or parcel of land, building or premises having any connection to the water distribution system of the city, or the sewage disposal system of the city, including the city. 
(Code 1981, § 30-94; Ord. No. O-7-01, § 1, 8-20-2001) 
Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 126-142. - Basis of charges. 
    The city council has determined that, in order to provide safe, adequate water to the users of the system, and to assure safe transportation and treatment of sewage discharged into the system by all users of the system, the system must receive sufficient total annual revenue to ensure the proper operation and maintenance of the system, the development and perpetuation of the system, and the preservation of the financial integrity of the system. The city council has also determined that the system shall be self-sustaining, supported solely by the revenues of the system and not dependent upon the property tax payers of the city. To meet those ends, city council shall annually fix the rates and charges to be imposed on all users of each component of the system in accordance with the principles and standards set forth in this article. 
    The purpose of sewer and water rates is to produce sufficient revenues each year to pay the costs of service. The city council has found that annual revenues and expenditures of the system can fluctuate substantially from year to year. City council has determined that, in order to provide adequate, but not excessive, annual adjustments in revenue levels in a timely manner, the city shall develop the estimated costs of service and shall base rates each year on those estimated costs. 
(Code 1981, § 30-95; Ord. No. O-7-01, § 1, 8-20-2001) 
Sec. 126-143. - Service to city. 
    The city shall pay for all water and sewer service used by it at the rates established in this article. Charges against the city shall be payable in quarterly installments from the current funds of the city or from the proceeds of taxes, which the city, within constitutional limitations, is hereby authorized and required to levy in an amount sufficient for that purpose. 
(Code 1981, § 30-96) 
Sec. 126-144. - Allocation of costs of service. 
    The city council has determined that each user benefits from at least that portion of the fixed costs of operating the water and sewage disposal system that relates to the size of the meter serving that user's premises. Therefore, city council has established the following classes of users, all of which shall pay a fixed minimum charge for the water and sewage disposal service according to the following meter sizes, and on the basis of the following relative burden on the system: 
Meter Size Relative Burden 0.0"-0.75" 1 0.76"-1.00" 4 1.01"-1.50" 10 1.51"-2.00" 13 2.01"-3.00" 15.5 3.01"-greater 55

Editor's note- Ord. No. O-7-01, § 1, adopted August 20, 2001, amended § 126-144 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, § 126-144 pertained to establishing rates and derived from the Code of 1981, § 30-97. 
Sec. 126-145. - Free service. 
    No free water or sewage disposal service shall be furnished by the city to any person, firm or corporation, public or private, or to any public agency or instrumentality. 
(Code 1981, § 30-98) 
Sec. 126-146. - Billing. 
(a)  All water customers shall be assigned a service account identification number by the city for billing and record keeping purposes. Not more than one service account identification number shall be assigned for each meter register. 
(b)  Charges for water service and sewage disposal service shall be billed and collected quarterly. The city may provide informal assistance, but shall not be obligated to issue multiple water bills which allocate charges among parties when there is more than one owner of a premises where a water service account has been established or when responsibility for payment of water service charges changes from one party to another. 
(c)  All water meters shall be read at least every third month. Billing of charges to residential service accounts may be assigned or reassigned to a rotating schedule so that approximately one-third of the accounts are billed and become due each month. Bills are due and become payable as of the first day of the month according to the assigned schedule for the account. 
(d)  Payment of bills by any means, including payments by mail, shall be received by the city at the office of the city treasurer without penalty up to and including the 18th day of the month in which they become due and payable. Thereafter, a penalty of ten percent shall be added to the unpaid balance of the current amount due. If the city hall is closed on the last date established for receipt of payments without penalty, the deadline shall be extended to include the next day that the city hall is open. The late payment penalty may not be waived except upon the authorization of the city manager. 
(Code 1981, § 30-99) 
Sec. 126-147. - Collection; turnoff charge. 
    The water department is hereby authorized to enforce the payment of charges or water service to any premises and the payment of charges for sewage disposal service or the sewage disposal service to such premises, or both, and an action of assumpsit may be instituted by the city against the customer. The charges for water service and sewage disposal service, which, under the provisions of Act 94, Public Acts of 1933 of the State of Michigan, as amended (MCL 141.101 et seq., MSA 5.2731 et seq.), are made a lien on the premises to which furnished, are hereby recognized to constitute such lien; and the city treasurer shall, annually, by April 1, certify all unpaid charges for such services furnished to any premises which, on March 31 preceding, have remained unpaid for a period of six months, to the city assessor who shall place the same on the next tax roll of the city. Such charges so assessed shall be collected in the same manner as general city taxes. Where the water service to any premises is turned off to enforce the payment of water service charges or sewage disposal service charges, the water service shall not be recommenced until all delinquent charges have been paid, and there shall be a water turnoff charge as presently established or as hereafter prescribed by resolution of the city council.

Editor's note- Ord. No. O-08-01, § 2, adopted August 21, 2001, amended div. 2 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Formerly, div. 2 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 4-94, §§ 2-8, adopted March 21, 1994. 

Sec. 126-161. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this division, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Combined sewer system: Public sewers, drains, ditches and retention ponds used for collecting and transporting storm water and non storm water in the city. 
    Director: The department of public works director or such other person as the city manager may designate. 
    Equivalent residential unit: A subunit of measurement which relates the volume of storm-water discharged from single-family residential lots to multifamily residential and non-residential lots based on the amount of total and impervious lot area. The formula for an equivalent residential unit (ERU) is as follows: 
1 ERU =  (0.15 (TA - IA)) + (0.90 (IA)) 
  N 
where, 
TA = total area of all single family residential lots; 
IA = impervious area of all single family residential lots; 
N = total number of single family residential lots; 
0.15 = runoff coefficient for pervious area; 
0.90 = runoff coefficient for impervious area. 
One ERU in the city is equal to 2,600 square feet. All single-family residential units in the city will be calculated as one ERU. 
    Impervious lot area: The area of a lot or parcel of land within the city that is covered by buildings, pavement and/or material that substantially reduces the rate of infiltration of storm water into the earth as determined from the dimensions and/or area measurements obtained from the Oakland County tax records, or on-site or photogrammetric measurements. Impervious lot area has a runoff coefficient equal to 0.90. 
    Industrial sites: Those sites that contain industrial activities which require wastewater discharge permits as set forth in section 126-122 of this Code. 
    Nonstormwater: All flows to the combined sewer system not defined as storm water in this section 126-161, of this division or as determined by the director. 
    Pervious lot area: All land area that is not impervious. Pervious lot area equals the total lot area, minus the impervious lot area. Pervious lot area has a runoff coefficient equal to 0.15. 
    Stormwater: Storm water runoff, snow melt runoff and surface runoff and drainage. 
    Storm water service charge: The charge imposed for the use of that portion of the combined system that transports storm water, based on the number of ERUs for a lot or parcel of land determined as provided in section 126-164. 
    Stormwater sewer system: That portion of the combined sewer system that is attributable to the transportation and treatment of storm water. 
    User: An owner of property which directly or indirectly contributes to the combined sewer system. 
(Ord. No. O-08-01, § 2, 8-21-2001) 
Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 126-162. - Storm water service charges. 
(a)  All users shall pay a stormwater service charge based on the volume of storm water which is projected to discharge into the combined sewer system from their property. 
(b)  The city council shall, by resolution, set storm water service charges at a rate which will recover each user its share of the costs of the storm water sewer system attributable to the discharge of stormwater from non city property. The city shall use the revenues of the stormwater service charges to pay the costs of water treatment operation and maintenance of the stormwater sewer system, and for necessary improvements and additions to the stormwater sewer system. 
(c)  The city may also collect from users charges imposed to pay the implementation and operation of any of the following: 
(1)  Monitoring, inspection and surveillance procedures; 
(2)  Reviewing accidental discharge procedures and construction; 
(3)  Discharge permit applications; or 
(4)  Other fees as the city may deem necessary to operate the stormwater sewer system.

Sec. 126-163. - Property affected. 
    The city shall impose the stormwater service charges on all regardless of whether privately or publicly owned. 
(Ord. No. O-08-01, § 2, 8-21-2001) 
Sec. 126-164. - Calculation of charges. 
    The stormwater service charge shall equal the number of ERUs for a given lot, multiplied by the annual rate established by the city council per ERU per year. The formula for determining the number of ERUs per multi-family residential or nonresidential lot shall be calculated from the amount of pervious and impervious lot area as follows: 
Number of ERU's =  0.15 (TA - IA + 0.90 (IA) 
  2,600 square feet/ERU 
where, 
TA = total area of each multifamily residential or nonresidential lot (reported in square feet); 
IA = impervious area of each multifamily residential or nonresidential lot (reported in square feet). 
(Ord. No. O-08-01, § 2, 8-21-2001) 
Sec. 126-165. - Billing. 
    The billing for the storm water service may be combined with the billing for other utility services. Final determinations on measurements per ERU will be determined by the director. 
(Ord. No. O-08-01, § 2, 8-21-2001) 
Sec. 126-166. - Collection. 
    Pursuant to section 126-147 of this Code, unpaid storm water service charges shall constitute a lien against the property affected. Charges which have remained unpaid for a period of six months prior to April 30 may be certified to the city clerk/treasurer who shall place the charges on the next tax roll of the city. In the alternative, the city council may direct the city attorney to take appropriate legal action to collect unpaid charges.

Sec. 130-31. - Purpose of article. 
    The purpose of this article is to promote the general welfare, health and safety of the public by protecting and preserving city water and sewer lines, public streets and sidewalks, the delivery of necessary heat and light to city residents and by controlling certain diseases and destructive pests through the regulation of the planting, maintenance and removal of all trees within the city. 
    Berkley's urban forest profoundly affects the community's distinctive character and enhances its visual appeal. The trees are a vital part of that appeal and an important asset to the natural ecosystem. Furthermore, the city finds that continued development and alteration of the land without specific regulations to protect trees results in unnecessary encroachment upon, damage to, or elimination of trees that are important physical, aesthetic, recreational, and economic assets to the community as a whole. The city is charged with protecting the health, safety and welfare of its current and future residents and the urban forest is an integral part. This article will establish standards for appropriate selection, location and maintenance of those trees. 
    The protection of such natural resources is a matter of paramount public concern, as provided by Article IV, Section 52 of the Constitution of 1963, and the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act of 1994, Act No. 451 of the Public Acts of Michigan of 1994 (MCL 324.101 et seq. as amended). 
    Specifically, the city finds that: 
(a)  Trees protect health through the absorption of air pollutants and contaminants, the reduction of excessive noise and the production of oxygen; 
(b)  Trees contribute to the stabilization of the land and prevention of flooding and erosion; 
(c)  Deciduous trees reduce energy consumption by shading and cooling the land in the summer and allowing sun to penetrate the land during the winter; 
(d)  Trees provide habitat for birds and animals, an essential part of the natural ecosystem; 
(e)  Trees provide economic support of local property values; 
(f)  Large trees, in particular, 
(1)  Produce more oxygen than smaller trees, 
(2)  Occur with less frequency than smaller trees, 
(3)  Are more valuable than smaller trees, 
(4)  Offer the community more intangible benefits, such as providing a living link between generations, and 
(5)  Are, for all intents and purposes, irreplaceable.

All disputes regarding privately owned trees between property owners after the certificate of occupancy is issued shall be a civil matter between those private property owners and not subject to the regulations of this article. 
(6)  Where tree relocation or replacement is not feasible on the property where the activity is to be conducted, the permit grantee shall pay into the city tree fund monies for tree replacement and a per tree amount representing the current market value for the tree replacement that would otherwise be required. 
(7)  These trees which cannot be reasonably expected to survive shall be approved for removal. The trees removed pursuant to this section shall be considered in the calculation replacement trees as follows. Whenever an approved tree survey and protection plan use allows the removal of trees eight-inch d.b.h. or greater, such trees shall be relocated or replaced by the permit grantee. All replacement trees shall be minimum two inches caliper or greater. Tree replacement shall be at the following ratio: 
Removed Tree Ratio d.b.h. 
(in inches) Replacement for 
Removed Trees 8 < 11 1 >11 < 20 2 > 20 < 29 3 > 30 4

(d)  Tree protection measures. 
(1)  Prior to development activities adjacent to publicly owned trees, the developer or contractor shall erect protective barriers as approved by the city manager or designee for the protection of those public trees. Protective barriers shall remain until all site activities have been completed. Protective barriers may not be relocated or removed without prior approval of the city manager or designee. Protective barriers shall be freestanding and in no way adhered to or attached to the city-owned tree. Protective barriers shall be visible and strong enough to withstand pressure from anything piled against it. 
(2)  The following activities are prohibited in regard to activity within the root protection zone of public trees; changing grade, stripping topsoil, dumping or placing of solvents, building materials, construction equipment or soil deposits. Additional pruning of any portions of public trees required for clearance during construction must be performed by a certified arborist and requires prior approval from the city manager or designee. 
(3)  If a city-owned tree is damaged during construction, it shall be reported immediately by the developer or property owner and evaluated by the city manager or designee for recommended treatments to be applied. Any roots damaged during grading or development shall be exposed to sound tissue and cut cleanly with a saw. If temporary haul or access roads are required over root areas of public trees, a roadbed of six inches of mulch shall be created to protect the roots. Maintenance of the six-inch depth is required during the time needed for such use. 
(4)  When protective barriers may be ineffectual in protecting roots in the root protection zone, the developer or contractor shall provide temporary buffers to prevent root damage as approved by the city manager or designee. The developer or contractor shall maintain a 4-6? thickness for coverage by material for protecting roots until final grading has been completed. 
(5)  Building material or other debris must be at least six feet from public trees and must not be placed in public right-of-way.

DIVISION 3. - BICYCLE PARKING REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 138-266. - Purpose. 
    The parking standards contained herein are intended to encourage public transit, bicycle usage and walking in lieu of automobiles. The requirements apply to bicycle parking on private property. For bicycle parking standards in the public right-of-way, see section 106-51. 
(Ord. No. O-1-13, § 2, 4-1-2013) 
Sec. 138-267. - Requirements. 
(a)  Number. A single inverted U or loop-style bicycle rack or another approved bicycle rack that will accommodate two bicycles shall be required when a parking lot is developed or an existing parking lot is resurfaced (including removal of asphalt but not including repair). In lieu of installing a bicycle rack on private property, the city may require the applicant to provide a bicycle rack in the public right-of-way within the same block said property is located. In these cases, the city shall install the bicycle rack and shall require that the fee for the bicycle rack as determined by city council be accompanied with the permit fee for the parking lot. 
(b)  Location . Bicycle parking shall be visible from a main entrance of the structure or facility. Bicycle racks shall be securely anchored to the ground and shall allow the bicycle wheel and frame to be locked to the bicycle rack. 
(c)  Size. Each bicycle parking space shall be sufficient to accommodate a bicycle at least six feet in length and two feet wide. Bicycle racks shall be installed no closer than two feet from a wall or parked vehicle. The bicycle rack shall be located where access is not restricted by legally parked vehicles. 
(d)  Maintenance. The surfacing of bicycle parking facilities shall be designed and maintained to be clear of mud and snow. 
(e)  Design . Required bicycle parking shall consist of a fixed bicycle rack, such as a hoop style rack or another type of rack that meets these standards. 

However, the City of Berkley recognizes that the installation of bicycle racks of innovative designs improves Berkley's transportation infrastructure and enhances the city's image as a livable city. Other designs will be considered. The following factors should be considered in developing and shall be considered in approving an individual design: 
(1)  Caneable? (Can be detected by visually impaired person using cane to navigate) 
(2)  Tripping hazard? (Nothing sticking out into pedestrian path of travel) 
(3)  Lockable? (Able to use a standard U-lock with the rack) 
(4)  Frame-restable? (36? height to allow leaning a bike against) 
(5)  Child proof? (Child can't put head through space and become trapped) 
(6)  Powder-coat or stainless-steel surface for durability 
(7)  Tamper-proof bolts? (Securing rack to service walk or parking lot) 

Styles that cannot ensure security and capacity shall not be approved. Below are some examples of such designs. 


(Ord. No. O-1-13, § 2, 4-1-2013) 
Sec. 138-268. - Parking credit. 
    Bicycle parking may be used to reduce the number of required off-street parking spaces. Existing developments may elect to reduce the required off-street parking by two car parking spaces by providing four bicycle parking spaces (i.e., by installing two inverted U, loop style, or other approved style of bicycle rack). 
(Ord. No. O-1-13, § 2, 4-1-2013) 
Sec. 138-269. - Approval process. 
    For new developments, the bike rack location and design shall be approved by the planning commission as part of site plan review. If a parking lot is being resurfaced, the bike rack location and design shall be approved by the building official as part of the building permit.

(a)  In the development and execution of this chapter, it is recognized that there are some uses which, because of their very nature, are recognized as having serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances thereby having a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas. Specific regulations of these uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood. These special regulations are itemized in this section. The primary control or regulation is for the purpose of preventing a concentration of these uses in any 1 area (i.e., not more than 2 such uses within 2,000 feet of each other which would create adverse effects, nor shall such use be located within a distance of 2,000 feet from any school, place of worship or public or institutional buildings or facilities). The uses to which these controls refer are as follows: Adult book or video store, adult entertainment center, adult minientertainment center, nude photographic studios and massage establishments. 
(b)  The city council may waive this locational provision for adult book or video stores, adult entertainment centers and adult minientertainment centers if the following findings are made:

The petitioner shall attempt to contact all eligible locations within this radius and must maintain a list of all addresses at which no contact was made. A minimum of 150 responses is required. If the 1,000-foot radius is not sufficiently populated to provide 150 residences and/or business places eligible to respond, the radius will be increased in increments of 100 feet until there shall be an area large enough to contain 150 eligible residences and/or business places. The city council shall set rules and regulations governing the procedure for securing the petition of consent provided for in this section. The rules shall provide that the circulator of the petition requesting a waiver shall subscribe to an affidavit attesting to the fact that the petition was circulated in accordance with the rules of the city council and that the circulator personally witnessed the signatures on the petition and that the same were affixed to the petition by the person whose name appeared thereon. The form of the petition shall be approved by the city council and shall clearly and unambiguously specify the nature and intent of the request for signature. The city council shall not consider the waiver of locational requirements until the above described petition shall have been filed and verified. 
(d)  All adult book or video stores, adult entertainment centers, adult minientertainment centers or retail establishments offering material described in this section shall comply with the following performance standards:
